He is quite alarmed (and embarrassed).</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of transient loss of consciousness? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Transient loss of consciousness may be caused by trauma, intoxication, seizures, hypoglycemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrovascular disease (involving the brainstem), or syncope. Although syncope is often incorrectly assumed to be synonymous with transient loss of consciousness, syncope actually refers to that <em>subset</em> of patients with transient loss of consciousness <em>due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion</em>, which in turn is virtually always caused by transient profound hypotension. <em>Therefore, the first pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness is to distinguish syncope from nonsyncopal causes of transient loss of consciousness</em>. Three critical characteristics help distinguish patients with syncope: Syncope is (1) abrupt in onset, (2) brief in duration, and (3) recovery is complete and spontaneous (Figure 31-1). The explanation for this is straightforward; because syncope is due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, the loss of consciousness is abrupt. Furthermore, restoration of blood flow must occur quickly or the patient would die rather than present with syncope. Therefore, syncope is brief. Finally, when blood flow is restored, spontaneous recovery occurs promptly. Patients with other features (eg, a prolonged recovery period) should be evaluated for nonsyncopal causes that may masquerade as syncope (eg, seizures, hypoglycemia). A useful question is to ask the patient what is the next thing the patient remembers after losing consciousness. Any significant persistence of confusion beyond a minute or two is critical because this would suggest a nonsyncopal etiology of the transient loss of consciousness (such as a postictal period from a seizure).</p><p><strong>Figure 31-1.</strong> Identifying syncope</p><p><em>The second pivotal step in patients with syncope identifies the likely category of their syncope: reflex, orthostatic,</em> or <em>cardiac syncope</em> (Figure 31-2). This narrows the differential diagnosis, since each of these categories is associated with specific underlying diseases. Importantly, this key step also helps identify patients with cardiac syncope who are at a substantially increased risk for sudden death. Sudden death may occur if the underlying cardiac process that caused the syncope (arrhythmias or obstruction [eg, aortic stenosis]) is prolonged rather than brief.</p><p><strong>Figure 31-2.</strong> Distinguishing cardiac, reflex and orthostatic syncope.</p><p>Patients with syncope should be carefully evaluated to determine if they have cardiac syncope and are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death.</p><p>The evaluation of all <em>syncopal</em> patients must include a thorough history, physical exam, and ECG. A detailed history of the event is critical and includes a description of the setting (prolonged standing, warm environment), prior volume loss (vomiting, diarrhea, melena, rectal bleeding), exactly what the patient was doing (exerting themselves), and the position they were in just prior to their syncopal event (standing, sitting, supine). Additionally, patients should be asked about triggers (pain, anxiety), prodromal symptoms that proceeded the syncope (nausea, abdominal pain), associated symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath), and any signs observed by bystanders. The patient’s medications should be reviewed and their past medical history scrutinized to look for any history of cardiac disease (including ischemic, valvular, or heart failure [HF]). The physical exam should check vital signs and orthostatic BPs in addition to a thorough cardiac and neurologic exam. Finally, an ECG should be obtained in every syncopal patient and examined for signs of arrhythmia, conduction disease, ischemia, or structural heart disease.</p><p>Patients with suspected cardiac syncope should be admitted for evaluation (Figure 31-3). Clues that suggest cardiac syncope include a prior history of cardiac disease; syncope while supine, sitting, or during exercise; associated symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath; a family history of sudden death; or age > 60 years. Physical exam clues include an abnormal rhythm, significant murmur, gallop, jugular venous distention (JVD), lung crackles, or significant edema. Finally, cardiac syncope should be suspected in patients with ECG abnormalities (abnormal rhythm, bundle branch block [BBB], ischemic changes (new or old), left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH], long QT, or preexcitation).</p><p><strong>Figure 31-3.</strong> Cardiac syncope.</p><p>It is useful to appreciate that since there are only 3 categories of syncope, one should also suspect cardiac syncope in patients whose description fits neither orthostatic or reflex syncope.</p><p>Orthostatic syncope is suggested by a history of syncope immediately upon standing or pronounced orthostatic hypotension on physical exam whereas syncope with prolonged standing or associated with abdominal discomfort suggests vasovagal syncope.</p><p>The last step in patients with orthostatic or cardiac syncope is to identify the specific etiology. Table 31-1 identifies various clues on history, physical exam, ECG, and echocardiography that can suggest specific causes of cardiac syncope.</p><p><strong>Table 31-1.</strong> Clues to cardiac syncope.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-transient-loss-of-consciousness><h4 id=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-loss-of-consciousness><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Differential Diagnosis of Transient Loss of Consciousness</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  <strong>Nonsyncopal causes</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Generalized seizures</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Cerebrovascular disease</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Vertebrobasilar insufficiency</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Subclavian steal</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Subarachnoid hemorrhage</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hypoglycemia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Trauma</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Intoxication</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Syncope</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Reflex syncope</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Vasovagal syncope</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Situational syncope (cough, micturition, or defecation)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Carotid sinus syndrome</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Orthostatic syncope</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Dehydration (vomiting, diarrhea, uncontrolled diabetes, overdialysis)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hemorrhage</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Autonomic failure</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Primary autonomic failure: multisystem atrophy, Parkinson disease</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Secondary autonomic failure: diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, uremia</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Medications (diuretics, alpha-blockers, vasodilators, nitrates)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Cardiac syncope</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Arrhythmias</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Tachycardias</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Ventricular tachycardia (VT)</p><p><strong>i.</strong>  Secondary to structural heart disease (eg, HF, ischemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction [MI], valvular heart disease)</p><p><strong>ii.</strong>  Congenital (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome)</p><p><strong>iii.</strong>  Electrolyte derangements or hypoxia</p><p><strong>iv.</strong>  Medications (tricyclic antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, phenothiazines, macrolides, protease inhibitors, nonsedating antihistamines, and diuretics [due to electrolyte abnormalities])</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Rapid supraventricular tachycardia (eg, Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Bradycardias</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Sinus node disorders</p><p><strong>i.</strong>  Sinus bradycardia (&lt; 35 bpm)</p><p><strong>ii.</strong>  Sinus pauses (> 3 seconds or > 2 seconds with symptoms)</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Atrioventricular (AV) block (second- or third-degree)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Structural (obstruction)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Aortic stenosis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Pulmonary embolism (PE)</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Rare causes: atrial myxoma, prosthetic valve dysfunction, aortic dissection</p><p>Mr. M reports that he was in his usual state of health and felt perfectly well prior to entering the anatomy dissection room. Upon viewing the cadaver, he felt queasy and warm. He became diaphoretic and collapsed to the floor. When he regained consciousness, he was very embarrassed but not confused. The instructor told him that he was unconscious for only a few seconds.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>As noted previously the first step in the evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness is to distinguish syncope from other causes. The abrupt onset, brief duration, and spontaneous unaided recovery are entirely consistent with syncope (Figure 31-1). The next step in the evaluation of such patients is to distinguish cardiac syncope from reflex or orthostatic syncope (Figure 31-2). The setting (associated with a strong emotional trigger) and associated prodromal symptoms of nausea and warmth are classic for vasovagal syncope, which is clearly the leading hypothesis. However, it is critical to also consider cardiac syncope, which is potentially life-threatening and is a must not miss hypothesis. While most causes of cardiac syncope are uncommon in young patients, HCM and channelopathies, such as the long QT syndrome, can present in children and young adults and must be considered. Indeed, patients with the long QT syndrome may have life-threatening arrhythmias triggered by emotional stress. Finally, orthostatic syncope is an alternative hypothesis that must also be considered. Table 31-2 lists the differential diagnosis and a careful history, physical exam and review of his ECG are required (Figure 31-2).</p><p><strong>Table 31-2.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. M.</p><p>Mr. M reports no diarrhea, vomiting, melena or rectal bleeding and he is not taking any medications. He has no known heart disease and exercises vigorously without symptoms. He reports no associated chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea. There is no family history of sudden cardiac death. On physical exam, his BP and pulse are normal and do not change with standing. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm without a significant murmur, JVD, S3 gallop, crackles or edema.

He reports that he was sitting at home watching television when he suddenly lost consciousness without any warning. His wife reports that he was unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds. There was no tonic-clonic activity or incontinence, and the patient was not confused after regaining consciousness. The patient’s wife reports that she took Mr. C’s blood glucose when he passed out and that the reading was 120 mg/dL.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>As illustrated in Figure 31-1, the first step in patients with loss of consciousness is to determine whether this was due to syncope, or some nonsyncopal cause (eg, trauma, intoxication, hypoglycemia, or seizure). As discussed previously, 3 questions help make this pivotal distinction: Was the loss of consciousness abrupt in onset, brief in duration, and was there spontaneous unaided recovery? Clearly, the story suggests that all 3 were true and he therefore suffered from syncope. (Although hypoglycemia should be considered in any patient with treated diabetes, his recovery without intervention essentially rules that out, as of course, does the normal blood glucose at the time.) The second pivotal step in syncopal patients is to determine whether the patient has cardiac, orthostatic, or reflex syncope. As illustrated in Figure 31-2, this process is driven by a search for risk factors and associated symptoms to determine whether the patient is at risk for cardiac syncope, which could be life-threatening. In particular, patients should be asked about a prior history of heart disease or a family history of sudden death; syncope occurring during exertion or in the supine or seated position; and any associated chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.</p><p>Mr. C denies any history of exertion prior to his loss of consciousness. He denies any associated chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea. Past medical history reveals that Mr. C has suffered 2 MIs. Subsequently, he has dyspnea upon walking more than 20 yards. His medications include atenolol, aspirin, atorvastatin, insulin, and lisinopril. On physical exam, his BP is 128/70 mm Hg with a pulse of 72 bpm, which is regular. There is no significant change upon standing. His lung exam is clear, and cardiac exam reveals prominent JVD and a loud S3 gallop. There is no significant murmur. He has 2+ pretibial edema, and his rectal exam reveals guaiac-negative stool.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><p>Mr. C’s does not have exertional syncope, chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea at the time of syncope. Nonetheless, his prior history of heart disease substantially increases the likelihood of some form of cardiac syncope, which becomes both the leading and must not miss hypothesis. The likelihood of cardiac syncope is increased even further because Mr. C’s history and exam are not suggestive of the other 2 types of syncope: orthostatic or reflex. (Orthostatic syncope is unlikely given his seated position, the absence of any history of volume loss or bleeding, and more importantly, by the lack of postural BP change with standing. Reflex syncope [due to neurocardiogenic syncope] is also unlikely given the lack of any trigger, prodrome and because Mr. C.’s syncope occurred while he was sitting.) He should be admitted for evaluation while his history, physical exam, and ECG are examined for clues that might suggest the etiology of his probable cardiac syncope (Table 31-1). Prior to ranking the differential, it is useful to review the syndrome of cardiac syncope.</p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-cardiac-syncope><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-cardiac-syncope><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Cardiac Syncope</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-2><h5 id=textbook-presentation-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Cardiac syncope refers to syncope secondary to disorders arising within the heart. Arrhythmias (either tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias) are the most common.

Furthermore, his history of dyspnea on minimal exertion, JVD, and S3 gallop all suggest HF. HFrEF also markedly increases the likelihood of VT, making this the leading hypothesis. Additionally, given Mr. C’s past medical history of CAD, an acute coronary syndrome, must also be considered (although an uncommon cause of syncope). Finally, another “must not miss” cause of cardiac syncope is PE. Table 31-4 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p>The ECG shows Q waves in leads V1–V4 and II, III, and aVF consistent with prior anterior and inferior MI. These were present on his prior ECG 6 months previously. The PR interval is normal. There is no evidence of sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or AV block. The QRS width is normal, excluding BBB. An echocardiogram reveals LV dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior and inferior walls. The ejection fraction is estimated to be 38%. The aortic valve is normal without evidence of aortic stenosis.</p><p>Reviewing the differential in Table 31-4, Mr. C does not have acute chest pain or ECG changes to suggest a new acute coronary event. The absence of BBB or AV block on the current ECG decreases the likelihood of AV block but does not exclude it, since AV block can be intermittent. His echocardiogram confirms HFrEF, which increases his risk for VT.</p><p><strong>Table 31-4.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. C.</p><a href=#revised-leading-hypothesis-vt><h4 id=revised-leading-hypothesis-vt><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Revised Leading Hypothesis: VT</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-3><h5 id=textbook-presentation-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Patients with VT may be asymptomatic or have symptoms that range from palpitations to light-headedness, near syncope, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.</p><p>VT occurs most commonly in patients with heart disease and should be seriously considered in patients with syncope and a history of preexisting CAD, HF, or other heart disease.</p><a href=#disease-highlights-3><h5 id=disease-highlights-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Etiology and associations</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Ischemic heart disease</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Associated with CAD in 80% of cases</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  May be secondary to acute ischemia/MI or prior scar</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  VT and ventricular fibrillation complicates 10% of STEMIs (ST-segment elevated MI)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  HF</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Other heart diseases: HCM, valvular heart disease, infiltrative disorders</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Miscellaneous causes</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hypoxia</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Drugs, particularly those that prolong the QT interval (eg, antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, some fluoroquinolones, and many others)</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Congenital disorders</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Congenital heart disease</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Long QT syndrome</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  The ECG of affected families demonstrates long refractory periods (long QT intervals defined as a QTc of > 450 ms in males and 460 ms in females)</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Affected patients are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death from a form of VT called torsades de pointes.</p><p><strong>(c)</strong>  Arrhythmias may be precipitated by emotional stress, exercise, loud abrupt noises, or during sleep.</p><p><strong>(d)</strong>  Several symptoms typically associated with vasovagal syncope are also common in the long QT syndrome: triggered by emotional stress, pain, or noise (70%); sweating (67%); nausea (29%); situational (associated with micturition, defecation, or coughing) (17%); abdominal discomfort (16%).</p><p>Long QT syndrome may mimic vasovagal syncope.

This discussion will focus on patients who experience syncope due to an acute coronary syndrome. Briefly, acute coronary syndromes account for approximately 3% of patients presenting to emergency departments with syncope. The mechanism of syncope varies and includes reflex syncope (particularly in inferior MIs), advanced AV block (particularly in anterior MIs) and VT. Symptoms are often atypical in syncopal patients with acute MI; chest pain is present in only 17%, dyspnea in 30%, and a history of CAD in 54%. Lab abnormalities include troponin elevation on presentation (50%) and ST-segment elevation (9%). Nonetheless, a normal ECG (defined as normal sinus rhythm without new or indeterminate changes) makes the diagnosis of acute MI unlikely, negative predictive value 99% (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 64%; LR+, 2.2; LR–, 0.31).</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis-1><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mr. C’s serum troponin levels are repeatedly undetectable (thus excluding acute MI.)

Furthermore, the cardinal features of syncope are an abrupt onset, brief duration, and a spontaneous unaided recovered. The remarkable feature of Mrs. S’s history is the prolonged period of lethargy and confusion that persisted until she reached the emergency department. This is a <strong>pivotal clue</strong> that suggests a nonsyncopal etiology for her loss of consciousness. Diagnostic considerations include seizure, hypoglycemia, intoxication, or another neurologic event (eg, an ischemic event involving the posterior circulation or trauma). The patient’s bruised tongue is a diagnostic fingerprint that markedly increases the likelihood of a seizure. Hypoglycemia-induced syncope is usually preceded by either confusion or sympathetic stimulation producing tremulousness, nervousness, or diaphoresis and occurs almost exclusively in diabetic patients taking insulin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones.

Therefore, <em>evaluation of the anterior circulation is not indicated in the patient with syncope.</em> On the other hand, obstruction of the posterior circulation may cause transient loss of consciousness by causing ischemia in the reticular activating system. This may occur in the subclavian steal syndrome, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and basilar artery occlusion. These disorders are almost invariably associated with neurologic signs or symptoms and should be considered whenever patients have syncope and other symptoms referable to the brainstem (ie, diplopia, vertigo, ataxia, and weakness) (see Chapter 14, Dizziness). Finally, patients in whom subarachnoid hemorrhage develops can present with syncope. Such patients inevitably also complain of severe headache or confusion.

She was in her usual state of health until the morning of admission when increasing left lower quadrant abdominal pain developed. The pain increased in intensity and became quite severe. Upon standing, she lost consciousness and collapsed to the floor. She recovered quickly and was helped to a chair by her husband. When she stood several minutes later, she briefly lost consciousness again. The patient reports that her abdominal pain is much better. She has no chest pain or dyspnea. Her vital signs are BP, 105/60 mm Hg; pulse, 85 bpm; temperature, 37.0°C; and RR, 18 breaths per minute. Her cardiac and pulmonary exams are normal, and abdominal exam reveals mild left lower quadrant tenderness. Her ECG is normal and her HCT is normal at 36.0%.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>As noted in Figure 31-1 the first step ascertains whether Mrs. P suffered from syncope or some other transient loss of consciousness. The history of abrupt onset and rapid recovery without intervention strongly suggests syncope. The next step considers whether this is likely due to reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, or cardiac syncope (Figure 31-2). Several features of Mrs. P’s syncope are noteworthy. First, her syncope occurred in association with abdominal pain raising the possibility of vasovagal syncope. Second, she had 2 episodes of syncope upon standing. This pivotal clue raises the possibility of orthostatic syncope from either dehydration, hemorrhage, medications, or autonomic dysfunction. Finally, cardiac syncope should be considered in all patients with syncope. Fortunately, Mrs. P has no prior history of heart disease that would increase the likelihood of cardiac syncope. Additionally, she has no suggestive symptoms (syncope with chest pain, syncope with exertion, syncope while sitting or supine, palpitations, or dyspnea), or signs (significant murmur, gallop, or JVD) to suggest cardiac syncope. Her ECG is also normal. The combination of the lack of underlying heart disease or suggestive symptoms of cardiac syncope, coupled with recurrent syncope immediately after standing makes orthostatic syncope likely and cardiac syncope unlikely. Table 31-9 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 31-9.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. P.</p><p>Further history reveals that Mrs. P is not taking any medications. Your initial assessment is a neurocardiogenic syncope secondary to transient abdominal pain.</p><p>As discussed in the first case presentation, vasovagal syncope is often precipitated by pain, is brief, and is followed by a rapid restoration of consciousness. Many of Mrs. P’s features are consistent with this diagnosis. However, both episodes of syncope occurred immediately after standing providing a clue that her syncope was in fact orthostatic. In addition, although her abdominal pain is improved, it is still unexplained. You elect to check her orthostatic BP and pulse, which is a key component of the evaluation of patients with syncope (Figure 31-2).</p><p>Mrs. P’s BP while supine was 105/60 mm Hg with a pulse of 85 bpm, which changed when sitting to BP of 95/50 mm Hg with a pulse of 90 bpm. Upon standing her BP fell to 60/0, her pulse was 140 bpm, and she lost consciousness. She was quickly laid down and again rapidly regained consciousness.</p><p>Orthostatic measurement of BP and pulse are critical. Life-threatening hypovolemia may be overlooked if the BP and pulse are not measured while the patient is standing.</p><p>Mrs. P’s profound drop in BP upon standing and recurrent syncope is a key pivotal clue and clearly indicate that her syncope is due to orthostatic hypotension. This is not consistent with reflex syncope. You revise the leading hypothesis to syncope due to orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?
