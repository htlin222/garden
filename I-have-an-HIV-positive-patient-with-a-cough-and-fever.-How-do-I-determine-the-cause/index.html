His chief complaints are cough and fever lasting for 4 days.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of cough and fever in HIV-positive patients? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The most common pneumonias in HIV-infected patients are bacterial pneumonia, PJP, and pulmonary TB. Taken together, they account for 91% of pulmonary infections in HIV-positive patients. Three pivotal features aid in the diagnosis of these common pneumonias in HIV-infected persons. First, the CD4TL count gauges the level of immunocompromise. Virulent infections, such as pulmonary TB or bacterial pneumonia, may occur in patients with <em>any</em> CD4TL count. On the other hand, less virulent infections, such as PJP, are seen almost exclusively in patients with CD4TL &lt; 200 cells/mcL.</p><p>The second pivotal feature is that certain diseases present acutely (bacterial pneumonia), but other diseases present subacutely or chronically (pulmonary TB or PJP).</p><p>The final pivotal feature that aids in the diagnosis of these complaints is the pattern on chest radiograph. Lobar infiltrates suggest bacterial pneumonia, whereas diffuse or interstitial infiltrates are seen in PJP and TB. Patterns that suggest pulmonary TB include apical or cavitary infiltrates (if CD4TL > 200 cells/mcL), hilar lymphadenopathy, or nodular infiltrates. The chest radiographic pattern in pulmonary TB varies depending on the patient’s degree of immunosuppression. Table 5-4 summarizes the typical CD4TL count, acuity, and chest radiographic pattern and approach to pulmonary infection in HIV-positive patients.</p><p><strong>Table 5-4.</strong> Summary of findings in pulmonary infection in HIV-positive patients.</p><p>Tumors may also cause pulmonary complaints. Not surprisingly, aggressive neoplasms, such as lung cancer, may occur at any CD4TL count, whereas pulmonary lymphoma usually develops in patients with CD4TL counts &lt; 500 cells/mcL, and Kaposi sarcoma usually develops in patients with CD4TL &lt; 200 cells/mcL.</p><p>As noted above, the most common pneumonias in HIV-infected patients are bacterial pneumonia, PJP and pulmonary TB. PJP is reviewed in Chapter 10 and will be mentioned here only briefly. There are a large number of less common causes of pneumonia in HIV-infected patients that will not be reviewed here including endemic or geographically limited fungi (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis), opportunistic fungi (cryptococcosis and, in late AIDS, aspergillosis), uncommon bacterial pathogens (<em>Nocardia</em>, <em>Rhodococcus equi</em>, <em>M kanasii</em>) and CMV. The remainder of this section will focus on bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary TB, and <em>M avium</em> infection in HIV-infected patients.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-processes-in-patients-with-hiv><h4 id=differential-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-processes-in-patients-with-hiv><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Differential Diagnosis of Pulmonary Processes in Patients with HIV</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  CD4TL count > 500 cells/mcL</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Bacterial pneumonia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Pulmonary TB</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Lung cancer</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  CD4TL count 200–499 cells/mcL: all of the above plus lymphoma</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  CD4TL count 100–199 cells/mcL: all of the above plus PJP</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  CD4TL count &lt; 100 cells/mcL: all of the above plus the following:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Fungal infections (blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and aspergillosis)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  CMV: when found in bronchoalveolar lavage culture, it usually reflects asymptomatic reactivation rather than the etiology of pneumonia, although CMV is occasionally responsible for pneumonia in advanced AIDS.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Nontuberculous mycobacteria, especially MAI and <em>M kansasii</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Kaposi sarcoma</p><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. L reports that he was feeling well until 4 days ago when he developed the sudden onset of fever 38.8°C, cough productive of green sputum, and right-sided chest pain with inspiration. He feels moderately short of breath with exertion. Medical history is remarkable for sexually acquired HIV infection diagnosed 2 years ago. His last CD4TL cell count 1 month ago was 400 cells/mcL. At that time, his viral load was undetectable. He is compliant with ART.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>There are 2 key features to Mr. L’s presentation. The first pivotal feature is that his CD4TL count is only moderately reduced. This makes a variety of OIs unlikely (PJP, MAI, CMV, and cryptococcosis). On the other hand, pulmonary TB, bacterial pneumonia, and blastomycosis are sufficiently virulent to present in patients with normal or mildly impaired immune systems. The second pivotal feature is the rapid development of the pulmonary process, which strongly favors bacterial pneumonia over pulmonary TB. The differential diagnosis is summarized in Table 5-5.</p><p><strong>Table 5-5.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. L.</p><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Physical exam reveals temperature, 38.6°C; BP, 120/75 mm Hg; HR, 110 bpm; RR, 18 breaths per minute. Lung exam reveals crackles over the lower one-third of posterior right chest. Chest radiograph reveals a right lower lobe consolidation. No effusion is seen. WBC is 8000/mcL with 15% bands. Sputum Gram stain reveals numerous PMNs and gram-positive diplococci. The initial AFB smear is negative. Blood cultures are sent.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Other common bacterial etiologies are <em>H influenzae; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Legionella; S aureus,</em> including community-acquired methicillin-resistant <em>S aureus</em>; and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</em></p><p><strong>2.</strong>  <em>S pneumoniae</em> is associated with higher WBC than <em>P aeruginosa</em> (12,400/mcL vs 5000/mcL) and higher average CD4TL count (106 cells/mcL vs 19 cells/mcL).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  <em>P aeruginosa</em> is the reported causative pathogen in up to 38% of hospital-acquired pneumonias and 3–25% of community-acquired pneumonias; it is associated with 33% in-hospital mortality rate.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Concomitant PJP is present in 13% of patients with bacterial pneumonia.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Complications and prognosis</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Bacterial pneumonia progresses more rapidly and is more often complicated in HIV-infected persons than in Non-HIV infected persons.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  30% of bacterial pneumonias are associated with bacteremia; bacteremia is more common with <em>S pneumoniae</em>.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Among hospitalized patients, overall mortality is 9.3–27%.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  6–13 times higher mortality than general US population (and 1.2–2.4 times higher than population > 65 years)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  5 predictors of mortality include septic shock, CD4TL count &lt; 100 cells/mcL, significant pleural effusion (extending beyond costophrenic angle), cavities and multilobar infiltrates. Mortality is proportional to number of risk factors (Table 5-6).</p><p><strong>Table 5-6.</strong> Mortality among HIV-positive patients with bacterial pneumonia.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Mortality increases during influenza season.

Do other tests need to be done to exclude the alternative diagnoses?</strong></p><p>A critical decision at this point in the evaluation of an HIV-infected patient with pulmonary complaints is whether the patient needs bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to establish the causative pathogen. In HIV-positive patients with infiltrates, bronchoalveolar lavage is highly sensitive (86%) if performed within 24 hours of starting antibiotics. Transbronchial biopsy increases the sensitivity further but is rarely performed. Due to the large number of potential pathogens, empiric treatment for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is often inappropriate <em>except</em> in the cases in which bacterial pneumonia is strongly suspected. Acute onset and focal infiltrates suggest bacterial pneumonia whereas subacute/chronic progression, diffuse infiltrates, and cavitary lesions suggest other etiologies. Bronchoscopy is often necessary in such cases unless sputum analysis is diagnostic (positive AFB or rarely positive silver stain). Mr. L’s acute illness, and focal findings on the chest radiograph strongly suggest bacterial pneumonia.
