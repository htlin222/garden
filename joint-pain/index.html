Cifu, MD</strong></p><a href=#chief-complaint><h3 id=chief-complaint><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mrs. K is a 75-year-old woman who complains of a painful left knee.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of joint pain? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The causes of joint pain range from common to rare and from bothersome to life-threatening. Even the most benign causes of joint pain can lead to serious disability. The evaluation of a patient with joint pain calls for a detailed history and physical exam (often focusing on extra-articular findings) and occasionally the analysis of joint fluid, serologies, and radiologic tests.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of joint pain can be framed with the use of 3 pivotal questions. First, is a single joint or are multiple joints involved (is the joint pain monoarticular or polyarticular)? If the pain involves just 1 joint, the next question is, is the pain monoarticular or extra-articular? Although this distinction may seem obvious, abnormalities of periarticular structures can mimic articular disease. Finally, are the involved joints inflamed or not? Further down the differential, the acuity of the pain may also be important.</p><p>Figure 27-1 shows a useful algorithm organized according to these pivotal points. Because periarticular joint pain is almost always monoarticular, the first pivotal point differentiates monoarticular from polyarticular pain. Periarticular syndromes are discussed briefly at the end of the chapter.</p><p><strong>Figure 27-1.</strong> Diagnostic approach: joint pain.</p><p>The differential diagnosis below is organized by these 3 pivotal points as well. When considering both the algorithm and the differential diagnosis, recognize that all of the monoarticular arthritides can present in a polyarticular distribution, and classically polyarticular diseases may occasionally only affect a single joint. Thus, this organization is useful to organize your thinking but should never be used to exclude diagnoses from consideration.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Monoarticular arthritis</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Inflammatory</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Nongonococcal septic arthritis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Gonococcal arthritis</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Lyme disease</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Crystalline</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Monosodium urate (gout)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD or pseudogout)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Noninflammatory</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Osteoarthritis (OA)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Traumatic</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Avascular necrosis</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Polyarticular arthritis</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Inflammatory</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Rheumatologic</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Psoriatic arthritis</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Other rheumatic diseases</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Bacterial</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Bacterial endocarditis</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Lyme disease</p><p><strong>(c)</strong>  Gonococcal arthritis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Viral</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Rubella</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Hepatitis B</p><p><strong>(c)</strong>  HIV</p><p><strong>(d)</strong>  Parvovirus</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Postinfectious</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Enteric</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Urogenital</p><p><strong>(c)</strong>  Rheumatic fever</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Noninflammatory: OA</p><p>Mrs. K’s symptoms started after she stepped down from a bus with unusual force. The pain became intolerable within about 6 hours of onset and has been present for 3 days now. She otherwise feels well. She reports no fevers, chills, dietary changes, or sick contacts.</p><p>On physical exam she is in obvious pain, limping into the exam room on a cane. Her vital signs are temperature, 37.0°C; RR, 12 breaths per minute; BP, 110/70 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm. The only abnormality on exam is the left knee. It is red, warm to the touch, and tender to palpation. The range of motion is limited to only about 20 degrees.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The patient’s symptoms and physical exam clearly localize the problem to articular rather than periarticular structures as the exam reveals an inflamed joint with limited range of motion. Considering the pivotal points in this case, we can limit the differential diagnosis to those diseases that cause acute, monoarticular, inflammatory joint pain. These include septic arthritis, gout, and pseudogout. Traumatic injury to the knee such as a meniscal injury or intra-articular fracture, although suggested by the history, are probably less likely given the mild nature of the injury and the inflammation of the joint.</p><p>Salient points of the patient’s presentation are the rapid onset of the pain; the mild, antecedent trauma; and the lack of systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss.</p><p>Gout is the leading hypothesis given its high incidence, the patient’s age, and the single inflamed joint. CPPD (sometimes referred to as pseudogout) is common in the knee of elderly patients and is high in the differential diagnosis. An infectious arthritis is probably less likely, given the sudden onset and lack of systemic symptoms, but it is a must not miss diagnosis since it would be potentially disastrous if left untreated. Both gonococcal and nongonococcal septic arthritis are possibilities. Lyme disease can affect multiple joints but most commonly causes a monoarticular arthritis of the knee. Table 27-1 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 27-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. K.</p><p>Mrs. K has never had a similar episode before. Her other medical problems include diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Her medications are insulin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There is no history of alcohol or drug abuse.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-gout><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-gout><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Gout</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Gout most commonly presents in older patients with severe, acute pain of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The pain generally begins acutely and becomes unbearable within hours of onset. Classically, patients say that they are not even able to place a bed sheet over the toe. On physical exam, the first MTP joint is warm, swollen, and red.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and most common crystal-induced arthropathy.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Gouty attacks occur when sodium urate crystallizes in synovial fluid inducing an inflammatory response.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The primary risk factor for gout is hyperuricemia.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The prevalence of gout increases with age and is more common in men than women.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Location</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The classic location for gout is the first MTP joint (podagra).</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The joints of the lower extremities and the elbows are also common sites (though usually after an initial attack of podagra).</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Gouty attacks often occur after abrupt changes in uric acid levels. Common causes are:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Large protein meals</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Alcohol binges</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Initiation of thiazide or loop diuretics</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Initiation of urate-lowering therapy</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Worsening kidney disease</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Gouty attacks can also be induced by trauma, illness, or surgery.</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  The initial attack nearly always involves a single joint, while later attacks may be polyarticular (sometimes in contiguous joints).</p><p><strong>I.</strong>  Forms of gout</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Acute gouty arthritis is by far the most common type of gout.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Chronic arthritis can develop in patients who have untreated hyperuricemia.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Tophaceous gout occurs when there is macroscopic deposition of sodium urate crystals in and around joints.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  The kidney can also be affected by gout. Sodium urate stones or a urate nephropathy can develop in patients.</p><p><strong>J.</strong>  Evaluation of a patient with gout</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Patients with a new diagnosis of gout should be evaluated for alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, myeloproliferative disorders, and hypertension.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Patients in whom gout develops before the age of thirty should be evaluated for disorders of purine metabolism.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Acute, inflammatory, monoarticular arthritis is an absolute indication for arthrocentesis.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Sampling synovial fluid will rule out potentially joint destroying septic arthritis and usually make a diagnosis.</p><p>Every acute, inflammatory joint effusion should be aspirated.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Arthrocentesis</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Joint fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Normal joint fluid is small in volume and clear with a very low cell count.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Characteristics of abnormal synovial fluid are shown in Table 27-2.

She reports being well until 2 days ago when she awoke with pain in both knees and mild pain in both wrists. No other joints were involved. She also noted a nonpruritic rash on her distal arms and legs. She describes the rash as “splotchy.” The joint pain has worsened over the last 2 days, and she reports that both her knees are swollen.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Ms. T has acute onset polyarticular joint symptoms. From her history of knee swelling, it is likely that she has arthritis rather than arthralgia. The pivotal points are acute onset and polyarticular involvement. Considering these points, and limiting the differential diagnosis based on the patient’s demographics and associated symptoms, we are able to come up with a fairly short list of probable etiologies.</p><p>Given the acuity of the illness, infectious arthritides need to be strongly considered. Many viral illnesses can cause arthritis. Parvovirus is probably the most common. Bacterial illnesses can cause polyarthritis in myriad ways. Septic arthritides, discussed above, can be polyarticular as can disseminated gonorrhea. Bacterial endocarditis can cause aseptic polyarthritis and can cause arthralgias. Acute rheumatic fever classically causes a migratory polyarthritis and rash. Lyme disease, discussed above, is most commonly monoarticular but can present in a polyarticular fashion. Reactive arthritis, occurring after enteric or urogenital infections, is also a possibility.</p><p>Although less likely, given the acute onset, primary rheumatologic diseases must also be considered. In a young woman with arthritis and a rash, SLE needs to be included on the differential diagnosis. As discussed above, rash, arthralgias, and arthritis are among the most common presenting symptoms in patients with SLE. In addition to the acuity of the onset, the lack of other organ system involvement would be a little unusual for patients with SLE. RA would be less likely given the patient’s age; however, Still disease, a variant of RA, may present acutely in young patients.</p><p>Given that the viral arthritides are more common than bacterial ones and, as far as we know, the patient has been previously well, viral arthritis is probably more likely than bacterial disease. Table 27-10 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 27-10.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. T.</p><p>On further history, Ms. T reports that, for the last 2–3 days she has experienced fatigue, myalgias, and fever to 39.4°C. There were no other symptoms.</p><p>She reports no travel outside Chicago, where she is a college junior, for the last year. She reports no known exposure to ticks and admits that she is seldom outside of the city. She does not use recreational drugs. She is not sexually active.</p><p>On physical exam, she appears healthy. Her vital signs are temperature, 36.9°C; BP, 106/68 mm Hg; pulse, 84 bpm; RR, 14 breaths per minute. On extremity exam, her wrists have normal range of motion but there is pain with extremes of flexion and extension in the wrists and MCPs. There is mildly decreased range of motion and warmth in the knees as well as small effusions.</p><p>Skin exam reveals a diffuse erythematous rash with macules on the hands, feet, and distal extremities. Palms and soles are spared. The remainder of the exam is normal. There is no heart murmur.</p><p>The patient’s history supports our initial hypothesis. The history of a recent febrile illness makes a viral or other postinfectious arthritis most likely. Lyme disease and bacterial endocarditis are very unlikely given her lack of suspicious exposure and the fact that she is otherwise presently well. SLE remains on the differential but is less likely.</p><p>In a patient with acute polyarthritis, a detailed history of recent illnesses must be taken.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Reactive arthritis is possible although the patient has not had a gastrointestinal or urogenital infection. Rheumatic fever seems less likely. Although she does have multiple Jones criteria (polyarthritis, arthralgia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and although the lack of a sore throat during the recent illness is not terribly helpful, the patient does not have a migratory arthritis or evidence of present streptococcal carriage.</p><p>Ms. T’s final test results included negative streptococcal antibody titers and blood cultures. Her ANA was positive (titer 1:80) as was her parvovirus IgM. She was treated with NSAIDs with good relief of her symptoms. Her rash resolved over 3–4 days, and joint pain was gone at a follow-up visit 2 weeks later.</p><a href=#chief-complaint-3><h3 id=chief-complaint-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. L is a 55-year-old man who comes to see you complaining of right hip pain. He reports suffering with the pain for about 2 years. The pain is worst in the morning and evening. In the morning, it is associated with stiffness. The stiffness lasts about 5 minutes and then improves. At the end of the day he routinely feels a dull ache that is worse if he has had a very active day. He recently noticed that he is unable to cross his legs (right over left) without discomfort.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mr. L is a middle-aged man with chronic, monoarticular symptoms. The time course, single joint involvement and noninflammatory nature of the process (we have not heard about warmth, erythema, or prolonged morning stiffness) are the pivotal points in this case.</p><p>Reviewing the initial differential diagnosis, the articular process that best fits the history is OA, a chronic, noninflammatory, often monoarticular arthritis. OA is so common in older adults that it becomes the diagnosis to disprove in all patients who have pain at all consistent with OA. The disease most commonly affects the fingers, knees, hips, and spine. CPPD, as was discussed previously, is another chronic degenerative arthritis that could produce similar symptoms and should be considered.</p><p>In patients with noninflammatory monoarticular symptoms, we also have to consider the specific periarticular symptoms that can affect the particular joint.</p><p>When considering the periarticular syndromes that cause hip pain, it is important to identify where exactly the patient feels the pain. Lumbar spine disease with radicular symptoms can cause pain in the buttocks or lateral hip. Trochanteric bursitis is a common cause of lateral hip pain. Inguinal hernias may cause groin pain. Femoral stress fractures may cause groin or lateral hip pain. Although such stress fractures are rare and are most commonly seen in young women, they should not be missed. Use of bisphosphonates or corticosteroids should raise the possibility of other causes of hip abnormalities, femoral shaft fractures and osteonecrosis, respectively. Table 27-14 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 27-14.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. L.</p><p>“Hip pain” is a nonspecific complaint. It is important to identify the exact location of the pain.</p><p>When asked to pinpoint the location of his pain, Mr. L reports that he primarily feels it in the groin. Rest, ibuprofen, and heat all seem to help the pain. He comes in today because he is in more constant pain, and he has begun to limp on bad days. His past history is remarkable only for mild asthma. He denies any previous injury to the hip. He has never been hospitalized or taken corticosteroids. His only medication is albuterol.</p><p>Vital signs are temperature, 37.0°C; RR, 12 breaths per minute; BP, 132/70 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm. On physical exam, there is no warmth, erythema, or tenderness around the hip or over the trochanteric bursa. Testicular and hernia exam are normal. Flexion and extension of the right hip are nearly normal. There is decreased range of motion in hip rotation with about 10 degrees in internal rotation and 20 degrees in external rotation.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Pain is usually worse with activity and improves with rest. Knees, hips, and hands are most commonly affected. On examination of the joints, there is bony enlargement without significant effusions.

Most of the periarticular syndromes that were considered initially have been made unlikely by the exam. Lumbar spine disease with radicular symptoms would not cause the limited range of motion that is seen on the patient’s exam. The predominant symptom in patients with trochanteric bursitis is tenderness over the bursa. Mr. L does not have a hernia on exam. Femoral stress fractures may cause groin pain but should not really cause limited range of motion. That said, this is a diagnosis that must not be missed, so further consideration should be given.</p><p>The working diagnosis of OA was made and the patient was given 1000 mg of acetaminophen twice daily.
