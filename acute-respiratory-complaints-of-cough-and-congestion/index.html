Importantly, there are many causes of pneumonia that need to be identified in order to make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-acute-cough-and-congestion><h4 id=differential-diagnosis-of-acute-cough-and-congestion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Differential Diagnosis of Acute Cough and Congestion</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Common cold</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Sinusitis</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Bronchitis</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Influenza</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Pertussis</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Pneumonia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Hospital-acquired pneumonia</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Aspiration pneumonia</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Tuberculosis (TB)</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Opportunistic (eg, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia [PJP])</p><p>The approach to such patients focuses on 2 pivotal questions. First, does the patient have symptoms, signs, or risk factors for pneumonia that warrant a chest radiograph or other evaluation? Second, in patients with pneumonia, is it a CAP vs. another type of pneumonia (such as PJP, aspiration pneumonia, TB, etc.) that requires additional diagnostic evaluation and/or treatment?</p><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Ms. L reports that she was in her usual state of health until 5 days ago when a cough developed. There was no associated sore throat, rhinitis, myalgias or headache. Two days ago, a low-grade fever (37.8°C) developed, which increased last night to 38.8°C. She reports that her sputum is yellow and that she has no chest pain or shortness of breath.</p><p><strong>How reliable is the history and physical exam for detecting pneumonia?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong>  The diagnosis of pneumonia is usually based on clinical findings (cough, fever, crackles), accompanied by infiltrate on chest film. Microbiologic confirmation is usually unnecessary.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  When evaluating a patient who has acute respiratory symptoms it is imperative to determine who is likely to have pneumonia and therefore needs a radiograph to evaluate their symptoms.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Prevalence of symptoms in patients with pneumonia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Cough, 96%</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Fever, 81% but 53% in the elderly</p><p>Elderly patients with pneumonia often <em>do not</em> have a fever. Clinicians should have a low threshold for obtaining a chest radiograph in elderly patients with a cough.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Dyspnea, 46–66%</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Pleuritic chest pain, 37–50%</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Chills, 59%</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Headache, 58%</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Physical exam</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  No single finding is very sensitive. Therefore, the absence of any single finding does not rule out pneumonia (Table 10-1).</p><p><strong>Table 10-1.</strong> Likelihood ratios for physical findings in pneumonia.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Neither a normal lung exam nor the absence of fever rule out pneumonia (LR–, 0.6 and 0.8, respectively).</p><p>A normal lung exam <em>does not</em> rule out pneumonia.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Normal vital signs make pneumonia less likely (LR–, 0.18).</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  The <em>combination</em> of normal vital signs <em>and</em> normal chest exam make pneumonia highly unlikely (sensitivity, 95%; LR–, 0.09).</p><p>Normal vital signs <em>and</em> a normal lung exam make pneumonia unlikely.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Egophony is fairly specific and significantly increases the likelihood of pneumonia when present (LR+, 8.6).</p><p>In summary, there are signs and symptoms that suggest pneumonia because they are unusual in upper respiratory tract infections or bronchitis. These include dyspnea, high fever (with the exception of influenza [see below]), altered mental status, hypoxia, hypotension, and abnormal findings on chest examination (dullness to percussion, crackles, decreased breath sounds, bronchophony, or egophony). Any patient with such symptoms or signs requires a chest radiograph to rule out pneumonia. A chest radiograph should also be strongly considered in patients at increased risk for poor outcomes, including immunocompromised patients, elderly patients, patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (in whom abnormal lung findings are also more difficult to appreciate). On the other hand, patients with normal vital signs, a normal lung exam and who are not at risk for poor outcomes do not normally need a chest radiograph. Figure 10-1 shows a diagnostic algorithm illustrating the initial approach to patients with cough and congestion.</p><p><strong>Figure 10-1.</strong> Initial approach to patients with cough and congestion.</p><p>In patients discovered to have pneumonia, the next pivotal step is to determine the likely etiologic pathogen(s) to ensure patients receive appropriate therapy. While most patients seen in the community with pneumonia have community-acquired pneumonia (due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Legionella,</em> and others), it is important to realize that many <em>patients from the community</em> have other types of pneumonia (ie, aspiration pneumonia, influenza pneumonia, TB pneumonia, etc.) caused by other pathogens that require different/additional antimicrobial therapy. A careful review of both the patient’s risk factors and chest radiograph often provide critical clues that suggest additional microorganisms needing evaluation and antibiotic coverage (Figure 10-2).</p><p><strong>Figure 10-2.</strong> Diagnostic approach to pneumonia.</p><p>Pneumonia in patients with <em>known</em> immunocompromise will not be covered in this chapter (known HIV, transplant recipients, and patients with granulocytopenia).</p><p>On physical exam, Ms. L is in no acute distress. Vital signs are RR, 18 breaths per minute; BP, 110/72 mm Hg; pulse, 92 bpm; temperature, 38.8°C. Pharynx is unremarkable; lung exam reveals normal breath sounds without crackles, dullness, bronchophony, or egophony.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>As noted above, the initial differential diagnosis of acute cough and fever includes acute bronchitis, influenza, and pneumonia. Like many real-life patients, this patient’s clinical picture is not typical for any of these conditions. Acute bronchitis may cause a cough and low-grade fever but 38.8°C is unusual. Pneumonia could clearly cause a cough and fever but is often associated with an abnormal lung exam. Influenza often causes cough and fever, (and a normal lung exam) but the subacute onset of fever and lack of other upper respiratory symptoms is unusual. It is also early in the season for influenza. Nonetheless, you decide that influenza is the leading hypothesis with acute bronchitis and pneumonia being active alternatives. Given the clinical uncertainty, a chest film and nasopharyngeal swab for influenza are ordered. Table 10-2 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 10-2.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. L.</p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-influenza><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-influenza><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Influenza</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Although there is a wide range of severity of influenza symptoms, patients typically complain of a severe, febrile, respiratory illness that begins abruptly. The onset is often abrupt (“like being hit by a train”), associated with severe myalgias (even their eyes hurt when they look around), diffuse pain (they may complain that their hair or skin hurts), respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinitis, pharyngitis), and high fever (occasionally as high as 40–41°C) that peaks within 12 hours. Patients may have rigors (frankly shaking chills) and headache (Figure 10-3).</p><p><strong>Figure 10-3.</strong> Timetable of symptoms and signs of influenza.

Antigenic shifts are most common with influenza virus A and are associated with epidemics.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Influenza infects respiratory epithelium.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Adults are infectious from the day prior to the onset of symptoms until about 5–7 days later (10 days in children).</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  The incubation period is 1–4 days.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Epidemiology</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Results in 55,000–431,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States and 17,000–51,000 deaths</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Influenza typically occurs during the winter months (between December and March in the Northern Hemisphere versus April and September in the Southern Hemisphere).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Influenza occurs throughout the year in the tropics.</p><p>Influenza is an unlikely diagnosis in the late spring, summer, or early fall.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Current prevalence of influenza helps determine likelihood and is updated frequently by the CDC:

Fever that increases over several days is not typical of influenza. When accompanied by cough, such a fever suggests bacterial pneumonia.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Prevalence of other symptoms in influenza</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Headache, 58–81%</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Cough, 48–94%</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Sore throat, 46–70%</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Gastrointestinal symptoms are not characteristic of influenza.</p><p>Patients with significant diarrhea or vomiting should be evaluated for an alternative diagnosis.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Symptoms help distinguish influenza from acute bronchitis or pneumonia (Table 10-3).</p><p><strong>Table 10-3.</strong> Comparison of features in influenza, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bronchitis.</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Influenza may also present as a COPD or heart failure exacerbation (with or without fever) and severe febrile illnesses.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Crackles are heard in &lt; 25% of patients.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Complications</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Pneumonia</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Influenza may cause pneumonia.

(Reproduced with permission from Elsayes KM, Oldham SA: Introduction to Diagnostic Radiology.

Although CAP is the most common type of pneumonia in patients presenting from the community, the next pivotal step reviews the clinical history and radiograph searching for clues that might suggest other types of pneumonia including TB, aspiration pneumonia, and <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (see Figure 10-2).</p><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. P has no known exposures to TB and was born in the United States. He admits to drinking heavily, often a pint of gin per day, and occasionally losing consciousness. He does not remember any episodes of vomiting and aspirating. He denies injection drug use and reports that he has not been sexually active in several years. He denies having sex with men.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><p>Although CAP is most common, Mr. P has several clinical features that increase the likelihood of other types of pneumonia. His alcohol use clearly increases the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia (even in the absence of known frank aspiration). Alcoholism, substance abuse, and neurologic disorders are leading risk factors for aspiration, and make this the leading hypothesis. Another important clinical clue is his long duration of illness, which suggests more chronic processes such as TB or PJP. TB is also more common in alcoholic patients and malnourished patients. Given the public health risks, TB is a must not miss possibility.</p><p>His radiograph (Figure 10-5) reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, which is typical of PJP (and can also be seen in <em>Mycoplasma</em> and influenza pneumonia). The long duration of symptoms is more suggestive of PJP, which due to its life-threatening nature and requirement for specific therapy is another must not miss hypothesis. PJP affects immunocompromised patients, including patients on chemotherapy, other immunosuppressive medications, and HIV-infected patients. It is important to consider PJP even in patients without a history of immunosuppressive therapy or <em>known</em> HIV infection because PJP can be the <em>presenting</em> illness in patients with HIV infection. It is important to appreciate that the sexual history often fails to elicit high-risk sexual behavior.

Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) refers to resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolone and 1 of 3 second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Precise drug recommendations evolve due to resistance.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Susceptibility testing is critical to ensure an appropriate regimen is used.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Direct observed therapy (DOT)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Premature discontinuation and nonadherence promote drug resistance and must be avoided.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  DOT refers to treatment protocols where public health officials directly observe patients swallow <em>each</em> dose of medication (administered 2–3 times/week).</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  DOT is strongly recommended and the standard of practice in the United States.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Due to the public health risks of MDR-TB, the responsibility for prescribing appropriate therapy and ensuring adherence rests on the public health program and clinician.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Effective regimens require at least 2 drugs to which the organism is susceptible.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Effective therapy takes many months.</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  All patients should be seen monthly to assess symptoms, side effects, and adherence to therapy.</p><p><strong>10.</strong>  TB therapy in HIV-infected patients is complex due to innumerable drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy and the need for differing regimens depending on the degree of immunosuppression.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  MDR-TB</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Defined when organisms are resistant to isoniazid and rifampin</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Accounts for 3.7% of new cases and 20% of previously treated cases worldwide.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  60% of cases of MDR-TB worldwide are in India, China, and Russia.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  In some countries, the rate of MDR-TB among new cases is 9–32% and > 50% in those previously treated.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Suspect MDR-TB in patients previously treated for TB, in patients who are HIV positive, in close contacts of patients with MDR-TB, and in patients who have not responded to therapy.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  9% of MDR-TB cases have XDR-TB.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  DOT should be used for patients with MDR-TB.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Surgery is occasionally used for patients with localized disease and persistently positive sputums. Antituberculous therapy is continued.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Treatment of active pulmonary TB in patients at low risk for MDR-TB</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Obtain baseline liver biochemical tests, CBC, basic metabolic panel, and uric acid. HIV testing is recommended. Tests for hepatitis B and C should be obtained in high-risk groups or patients with abnormal baseline liver biochemical tests. Ophthalmology evaluation is recommended for patients receiving ethambutol.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  A rapid molecular test for drug resistance is recommended in patients at risk for drug resistance (see above).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Treat for 2 months with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol and then simplify the regimen to isoniazid and rifampin, if the organism is fully susceptible, for an additional 4 months. Ethambutol can be discontinued earlier if the organism is susceptible to both isoniazid and rifampin.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Empiric therapy (prior to the results of microscopy, NAAT- and culture), should also be started in patients with a high likelihood of TB and those seriously ill with suspected TB. Therapy can then be continued or stopped depending on test results (Figure 10-7).</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  More aggressive therapy is required for patients with cavitary TB.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Obtain follow-up liver biochemical tests in symptomatic patients and those at high risk for isoniazid hepatotoxicity, including patients with risk factors for hepatitis (eg, alcohol consumption, pregnancy or postpartum, HIV-infection, chronic liver disease, or other hepatotoxic medications) and patients receiving pyrazinamide after the first 2 months.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Visual acuity and color discrimination tests are recommended at baseline and monthly during ethambutol use to detect optic neuritis.</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  See Chapter 5 for recommendations in HIV-infected persons.</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  The median duration of fever after the institution of antituberculous drugs was 10 days but ranged from 1 to 109 days. For patients with tuberculous effusion, resorption can take 4 months.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Pleural fluid drainage does not improve outcome in patients with tuberculous effusions (nonempyema).</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Treatment of latent TB</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Expert consultation is recommended if exposure to drug-resistant TB is likely.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Isoniazid is the most commonly used treatment option; rifampin for 4 months has recently been shown to be noninferior.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Isoniazid</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Dose is 300 mg/day for 9 months or 900 mg twice a week with DOT.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Reduces subsequent development of active TB from 14.3% to 3.6% in individuals with radiographic evidence of healed TB.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Side effects include hepatitis (0.1– 2.3%) and neuropathy (2%). Neuropathy can be prevented with pyridoxine (25–50 mg/day). Advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women, HIV-infected persons and those with diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, malnutrition, or chronic kidney failure taking isoniazid.</p><a href=#case-resolution-1><h3 id=case-resolution-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>Unfortunately, Mr. P’s HIV result was positive; his CD4 count was 100 cells/mcL, and PJP was strongly suspected.
