Typically, patients with either wheezing or stridor describe their symptoms simply as wheezing. The physical exam will determine whether the patient actually has wheezing or stridor. Because the differential diagnosis for airway obstruction is extensive, an anatomic approach is helpful.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Stridor</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Nasopharynx and oropharynx</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Tonsillar hypertrophy</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Pharyngitis</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Peritonsillar abscess</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Retropharyngeal abscess</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Laryngopharynx and larynx</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Epiglottitis</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Paradoxical vocal cord movement (PVCM)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Anaphylaxis and laryngeal edema</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Postnasal drip</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Benign and malignant tumors of the larynx and upper airway</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Vocal cord paralysis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Trachea</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Tracheal stenosis</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Tracheomalacia</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Goiter</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Proximal airways</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Foreign-body aspiration</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Ingestion or inhalation of caustic materials</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Burn injury</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Wheezing</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Proximal airways: Bronchitis</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Distal airways</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Asthma</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Pulmonary edema</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Pulmonary embolism</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Bronchiectasis</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Bronchiolitis</p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Heart failure</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Sarcoidosis</p><p>Mr. C has been having symptoms for 1–2 years. His symptoms have always been so mild that he has never sought care. Over the last month, he has been more symptomatic with wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. His symptoms are worse with exercise and worse at night. He notes that he often goes days without symptoms.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Figure 33-1 shows an algorithmic approach to the patient with wheezing or stridor. The presence of wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath are pivotal clues that place asthma at the top of the differential diagnosis. Although asthma is by far the most likely diagnosis, other diseases that could account for recurrent symptoms of airway obstruction should be considered (Table 33-1). Allergic rhinitis can cause cough and wheezing, but it would be very unusual for it to cause shortness of breath. Vocal cord dysfunction, such as PVCM, is frequently confused with asthma and can cause recurrent stridor. COPD can also cause chronic wheezing and pulmonary symptoms.</p><p><strong>Figure 33-1.</strong> Evaluation of the patient with wheezing or stridor.</p><p><strong>Table 33-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. C.</p><p>On further history, Mr. C reports that he had asthma as a child and was treated for years with theophylline. He was without symptoms until he moved 2 years ago.</p><p>He reports that his symptoms are worst when he has a cold, when he jogs, and when he is around dogs or cats. His most common symptoms are chest tightness and dyspnea. Only when his symptoms are at their worst does he hear wheezing. He has never smoked cigarettes.</p><p>On physical exam he appears well. His vital signs are BP, 120/76 mm Hg; RR, 14 breaths per minute; pulse, 72 bpm; temperature, 36.9°C. His lung exam is normal without wheezes or prolonged expiratory phase. His peak flow is 550 L/min (87% of predicted).</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-asthma><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-asthma><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Asthma</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Asthma commonly presents as recurrent episodes of dyspnea, often with chest tightness, cough, and wheezing. Patients usually report stereotypical triggers (eg, allergens, cold weather, exercise) and rapid response to beta-agonist inhalers.</p><p>Asthma is a common cause of wheezing; however, the absence of wheezing by no means excludes the diagnosis of asthma.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Definition: The definition of asthma in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program’s Expert Panel Report is “A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role.” “In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, particularly at night and/or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow limitation that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment.”</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Clinical manifestations</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Asthma is recurrent and intermittent.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Most patients will have periods with no, or only mild, symptoms.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Patients with severe disease will have persistent symptoms.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Asthma usually presents during childhood but presentation as an adult is not uncommon.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Airway function fluctuates in people with asthma more widely than in those without the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Airway function is most commonly measured by peak expiratory flow (PEF).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Values are generally lowest in the morning and highest at mid-day.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  PEF will vary by more than 20% in asthmatic patients over the course of the day.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Identifying exacerbating factors and timing of symptoms is important. It aids in the diagnosis of asthma (exacerbating factors are stereotypical) and in treatment (if the factors are avoidable or reversible).</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Asthma frequently worsens at night (probably related to decreased mucociliary clearance, airway cooling, and low levels of endogenous catecholamines).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Asthma frequently worsens with exercise (probably related to airway cooling and drying).</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Viral infections are a common cause of asthma exacerbations.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  A long list of airway irritants and occupational agents may cause or exacerbate asthma by a number of mechanisms:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Cigarette smoke, perfumes, exhaust</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Corrosive agents (ammonia)</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Pharmacologic agents (organophosphates)</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Reflex bronchoconstriction (ozone)</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  IgE-mediated (latex)</p><p>Asthma should be in the differential diagnosis of any patient with intermittent respiratory symptoms.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Classification: The present classification scheme for asthma helps focus attention on the severity of the asthma and dovetails nicely with treatment considerations (Table 33-2). It should be noted, however, that by necessity this scheme simplifies asthma phenotypes and many patients do not fit well into a single category.</p><p><strong>Table 33-2.</strong> Classification of asthma severity.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Exacerbations or “flares”</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Asthma exacerbations are periods of increased disease activity identified by increased</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Airflow obstruction</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Symptoms</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Medication use</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Exacerbations may or may not be caused by an identifiable trigger.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Management of an exacerbation depends on an accurate assessment of the cause of the exacerbation and the risk to the patient.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  There is no single test to diagnose asthma; the diagnosis is clinical, based on multiple findings in the history, physical exam, and spirometry.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Asthma is easily recognized when it presents with intermittent wheezing; in fact, the diagnosis is often made by the patient.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Diagnosing asthma is challenging when it presents in atypical ways. Asthma should be high in the differential diagnosis when a patient has any of the following intermittent symptoms:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Wheezing</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Dyspnea</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Cough</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Chest tightness</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The key points in establishing the diagnosis of asthma are:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Episodic symptoms of airflow obstruction</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Reversibility of the airflow obstruction</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Exclusion of other likely diseases</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  There are not great data on the test characteristics of various symptoms of asthma.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  One large study interviewed nearly 10,000 healthy, community-dwelling people regarding pulmonary symptoms in the preceding 12 months.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  225 of these people had asthma, defined as reporting that they had asthma and that a medical professional had confirmed the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  The test characteristics of the most predictive historical features are shown in Table 33-3.</p><p><strong>Table 33-3.</strong> Test characteristics of symptoms for the diagnosis of asthma.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  It is important to note that these test characteristics were derived in a healthy population. Specificities would be lower in a population containing patients with other cardiopulmonary diseases.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  In another study, which used a methacholine challenge test to diagnose asthma, 90% specificity was achieved for making the diagnosis of asthma with the question, “Do you cough during or after exercise?”</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Other clues that make the diagnosis more likely are outlined in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program’s Expert Panel Report:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Diurnal variability in PEF (> 20% variability between best and worst)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Exercise</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Viral infections</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Animals with fur or hair</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  House dust mites</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Mold</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Smoke</p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Pollen</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Weather changes</p><p><strong>i.</strong>  Laughing or hard crying</p><p><strong>j.</strong>  Airborne chemicals or dust</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Symptoms occur or worsen at night.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  There is some evidence that people with asthma describe their dyspnea differently from people with other cardiorespiratory diseases.

Conversely, a patient whose decreased wheezing is accompanied by lessened respiratory distress and normal breath sounds likely has improved airflow obstruction.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Other tests</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Spirometry is crucial in determining severity of exacerbation.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  A mild exacerbation is defined by symptoms only with activity and a FEV1 or PEF or ≥ 70% of predicted.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  A moderate exacerbation includes symptoms with usual activities and a FEV1 or PEF 40–69% of predicted.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  In a severe exacerbation, patients have dyspnea at rest and dyspnea that interferes with conversation and a FEV1 or PEF &lt; 40% of predicted.</p><p>Spirometry and the history of the patient’s prior exacerbations are the most important pieces of information for making admission decisions.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are useful in patients whose peak flows are not improving with treatment.

He was told to use 2 puffs as needed as well as 30 minutes before exercise or expected animal exposure. On follow-up 6 weeks later, Mr. C reported improvement in his symptoms. He was able to exercise without difficulty as long as he was using his inhalers and could spend short amounts of time around friends’ pets.</p><p>Spirometry revealed an FEV1 of 70% of predicted that normalized with albuterol.</p><p>At follow up a few months later he reported that he was using his albuterol inhaler daily to maintain his asthma control.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, asthma? Have you ruled out the active alternatives? Do other tests need to be done to exclude the alternative diagnoses?</strong></p><p>Mr. C’s clinical history is consistent with asthma. The history of childhood asthma both makes asthma the most likely diagnosis and makes his complaint of “wheezing” more reliable. The absence of wheezing on exam certainly does not exclude the diagnosis of asthma. He has intermittent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and chest tightness. The presence of exacerbating factors and the results of spirometry further raise the likelihood of asthma as the diagnosis.</p><p>Because asthma is very common and the initial treatment is benign, the treatment threshold is low. A therapeutic trial of medication is nearly always appropriate.</p><a href=#case-resolution><h3 id=case-resolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>The patient’s history and response to therapy confirms the diagnosis of asthma. The patient has no nasal symptoms that would suggest allergic rhinitis. COPD is unlikely without a smoking history. Vocal cord dysfunction will be discussed below and is also unlikely. Heart failure is unlikely given the patient’s age, the absence of a history of heart disease, and his response to bronchodilators.</p><p>Given the frequency of his use of albuterol, the patient was given low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. His symptoms subsequently improved with only rare need for albuterol. The following year, Mr. C’s symptoms worsened. His asthma was eventually controlled with higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids. He was able to wean these medications after he had carpets in his house removed.</p><a href=#chief-complaint-1><h3 id=chief-complaint-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mrs. P is a 62-year-old woman who arrives at the emergency department with shortness of breath and wheezing. She says that the symptoms have been present for 3 days. The symptoms are present both at rest and with exertion and have not improved with an albuterol inhaler.</p><p>She reports that she has had these symptoms intermittently for 6 years. When the symptoms occur, they generally last for hours to a few days. She had been diagnosed with asthma and took long- and short-acting beta-agonists and inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, before coming off all medications 1 year ago. She stopped her medications out of frustration with side effects and perceived lack of efficacy. She decided instead to treat herself with yoga and meditation. She reports no episodes since this decision.</p><p>Presently she denies cough, chest pain, fever, or rhinitis. She does report hoarseness that occurs when her breathing is bad.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>As discussed above, asthma is very common and should be considered in anyone with intermittent pulmonary symptoms. The lack of symptom improvement with a beta-agonist and the discontinuation of an aggressive asthma regimen without ill effects both argue against the diagnosis of asthma in this case. In addition, the patient’s complaint of hoarseness is atypical in asthma. (Hoarseness does sometimes occur with asthma if there is associated GERD, postnasal drip, or vocal cord myopathy caused by inhaled corticosteroids.) Determining whether her symptoms are wheezing or stridor will help narrow the diagnosis. PVCM is a syndrome of episodic adduction of the vocal cords producing stridor. The lack of response to bronchodilators and associated hoarseness are clues to this diagnosis. GERD is a very common diagnosis (see Chapter 9). It can cause and worsen asthma and can cause hoarseness via irritation of the vocal cords. It is sometimes associated with PVCM. Angioedema occurs when vascular permeability increases leading to tissue edema. Airway compromise and stridor can occur. It is usually associated with other signs such as facial swelling, tongue swelling, or hives. Table 33-5 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 33-5.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. P.</p><p>On further history, she reports that her present symptoms are moderate for her.

Both of these points make an infectious etiology likely. Because the symptoms are not recurrent, asthma (the most common cause of airway obstruction) is unlikely. Acute infectious causes need to be considered first. These include common conditions, such as pharyngitis, and rare but serious causes, such as epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Angioedema is possible, but the infectious symptoms (fever and pain) and the lack of visible swelling make this less likely. Aspiration of a foreign body could cause either a pneumonia or infection of the soft tissues of the neck resulting in fever.

COPD and asthma should be high in the differential diagnosis. Heart failure is also a possibility. The patient’s smoking history is a risk factor for coronary disease, the most common cause of heart failure. As noted in Chapter 15, Dyspnea, heart failure frequently complicates COPD or is misdiagnosed as the pulmonary disease, especially when a patient presents with dyspnea. Bronchiectasis could cause symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, but the patient’s sputum production seems to be a minor symptom (rather than a predominant symptom as is usually the case in bronchiectasis). Tuberculosis should probably be considered in the differential, since it can cause chronic cough and dyspnea. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, if tuberculosis were the cause, weight loss and other constitutional signs would be expected.
