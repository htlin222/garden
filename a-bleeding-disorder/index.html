Bleeding due to platelet abnormalities, whether due to reduced number or abnormal function of platelets, is usually small vessel bleeding, and produces such findings as petechiae, bruising, gum bleeding, or nosebleeds. The bleeding starts and persists immediately following the injury that induces it. Platelet-related bleeding is generally not quantitatively significant (ie, platelet-related bleeding tends not to cause serious blood loss requiring red cell transfusions). Nonetheless, platelet-related bleeding can still be clinically important if a patient bleeds a small amount into the brain (unusual unless the platelet count is &lt; 10,000/mcL) or induces an abdominal hematoma from vigorous coughing, for example. By contrast, bleeding due to coagulation factor deficiencies or inhibitors tends to be delayed; that is, a platelet plug slows or stops the bleeding immediately after an injury, but the platelet plug is then not bolstered by the stable fibrin clot that is meant to definitively stop the bleeding. Bleeding due to coagulation factor abnormalities is more likely to be quantitatively significant, generally occurring in joints, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, brain, retroperitoneum, or at sites of recent injury or medical or surgical intervention.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Structural causes</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Tissue injury from trauma</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Abnormality of the tissue such that minor trauma causes bleeding, such as a toothbrush causing gum bleeding from inflammatory gingival disease</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Bleeding due to platelet disorders</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Disorders of platelet number (thrombocytopenia)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Decreased production of platelets</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Medications (examples include valproic acid, linezolid, thiazide diuretics, gold compounds, antineoplastic chemotherapy drugs)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Bone marrow replacement by malignancy, fibrosis, granulomas</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Bone marrow aplasia</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Suppression of megakaryocyte production by heavy alcohol use</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Vitamin B12 deficiency (megaloblastic hematopoiesis is a DNA synthetic defect affecting all cell lines, not only erythroid)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Increased loss or consumption of platelets</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Splenic sequestration (platelet count usually stays above 40,000/mcL)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Autoimmune thrombocytopenia</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Idiopathic (also called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP])</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  HIV</p><p><strong>(c)</strong>  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</p><p><strong>(d)</strong>  Lymphoproliferative disorders</p><p><strong>(e)</strong>  Hepatitis C</p><p><strong>(f)</strong>  Medications (examples include heparin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, sulfonamides, quinine, antiplatelet drugs used for coronary syndromes such as abciximab or tirofiban)</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Sepsis</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Disorders of platelet function</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Congenital</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  von Willebrand disease</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Other rare genetic abnormalities</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Acquired</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Medications, such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The bleeding lasts only briefly, and she does not consider it to be a large amount of blood. Her gums do not hurt, and she is timely with her dental care. At her last cleaning a month ago, she was told all was well. She has also noted some tiny red dots on her ankles in the past week—they are not raised and do not itch or hurt. She notes that her last menstrual period was somewhat heavier than usual, and she has had an intermittent headache over the last 2 days, partially relieved by acetaminophen. Otherwise, she has taken no medications. On examination, she looks well and has normal vital signs. Her oral examination shows evidence of recent gingival bleeding, and there are a few palatal petechiae. She also has petechiae on her antecubital fossae and ankles. There is no lymphadenopathy. Chest and abdominal examinations are normal, with no splenomegaly noted.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>There are several pivotal points in Ms. A’s presentation that suggest her bleeding is due to a platelet disorder: the bleeding occurs immediately after the trauma of tooth brushing, she has petechiae on her skin, and the bleeding is small volume.</p><p>The second pivotal point is that her history further suggests that her platelet disorder is acquired. If she had a congenital platelet disorder, such as von Willebrand disease, she might have had life-long heavy menses and other manifestations of bleeding. In this case, her symptoms just began 2 weeks ago. A platelet count will confirm that her bleeding is related to thrombocytopenia, rather than platelet dysfunction, which is less commonly seen. (If the platelet count is normal, platelet dysfunction should be suspected, and a test such as the PFA-100 assay should be ordered. This test is a reproducible screening tool for platelet function abnormalities. It measures the time to formation of a platelet plug in response to collagen along with adenosine diphosphate [ADP] or epinephrine.) The most common cause of thrombocytopenia in a young woman with no signs of systemic illness is idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Although Ms. A’s headache is mild and she looks well, TTP can present with headache and thrombocytopenia and also tends to occur in young women. Finally, it is critical to remember that the platelets are only 1 of the cell lines affected by bone marrow disorders, and that a serious bone marrow condition (eg, acute leukemia) might first manifest as thrombocytopenia. A key step, then, is to decide if the thrombocytopenia is isolated or part of a pancytopenia picture, such as one might encounter with acute leukemia.</p><p>Table 8-1 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 8-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. A.</p><p>Ms. A’s laboratory tests indicate a WBC of 5600/mcL, RBC of 3.9 million/mcL, Hb of 11.2 g/dL, HCT of 33.5%, and platelet count 8000/mcL. The reticulocyte production index is 1.0. Examination of the peripheral blood smear shows markedly decreased platelets with some large platelet forms, and normal RBC and WBC morphology.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-itp><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-itp><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: ITP</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>The classic presentation is gum bleeding or petechiae in a previously healthy person not exposed to medications that can cause thrombocytopenia. The platelet count is low, with large platelets seen on peripheral blood smear; other cell lines are normal. Physical exam, other than the minor bleeding, is normal.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  ITP is an autoimmune disorder primarily of young women. This is the demographic group that commonly suffers from other autoimmune disorders such as SLE or thyroid disease.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  A better term might be autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, since some cases are not idiopathic but are secondary to other conditions, such as lymphoproliferative disorders, collagen vascular disorders (eg, SLE), or infectious disorders (eg, chronic hepatitis or HIV infection).</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The prevalence is approximately 100 cases per million persons.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  ITP is a clinical diagnosis.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  A bone marrow examination is not required for diagnosis.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  If performed, it would likely show normal or increased megakaryocytes, indicating adequate platelet production and suggesting the thrombocytopenia is due to peripheral destruction of platelets in the reticuloendothelial system.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  A bone marrow examination should be done when the presentation is atypical, for example:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Patient has splenomegaly or significant lymphadenopathy or other cytopenias</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  The patient is older.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Serum antiplatelet antibody tests are about 50–60% sensitive and not sufficiently specific to make the diagnosis of ITP.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  They are not considered sufficiently reliable for general use in diagnosing ITP.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  If there is serious consideration of a drug-induced cause of immune thrombocytopenia, it may be possible to demonstrate drug-related antiplatelet antibodies in reference laboratories.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  A successful clinical trial of corticosteroid therapy may also serve as strong evidence of the correct diagnosis of ITP.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Serologic studies are indicated if SLE, hepatitis C, or HIV infection is suspected.</p><a href=#treatment><h5 id=treatment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  High-dose corticosteroid, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, is the initial treatment for all patients.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Patients who do not respond to corticosteroids or whose thrombocytopenia recurs when the corticosteroids are stopped may undergo splenectomy, which removes a site of antibody production as well as a site of reticuloendothelial system destruction of antibody-coated platelets.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  In refractory cases, other immunosuppressants may be used, such as rituximab, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Thrombopoietin analogues such as romiplostim and eltrombopag have become more widely used for treatment of refractory cases of ITP.</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Ms. A’s WBC count and Hb are normal, eliminating leukemia as a possible diagnosis. Her blood smear does not show schistocytes (seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), suggesting that she does not have TTP. Further, her reticulocyte production index is low and there are no spherocytes, suggesting that she does not have immune hemolytic anemia accompanying the immune thrombocytopenia.

Her bleeding is consistent with platelet-induced bleeding confirmed by her thrombocytopenia. There is no evidence to suggest decreased production (no pancytopenia, medication use or underlying condition) making platelet destruction most likely. Finally, this appears to be immune-mediated rather than microangiopathic given the lack of schistocytes or hemolysis making the diagnosis of ITP appear firm. Ms. A begins treatment with prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg orally daily. After 1 week, her platelet count rises to 40,000/mcL, and after 2 weeks, to 130,000/mcL. She then begins a prednisone taper over many weeks, and her platelet count remains above 100,000/mcL.</p><p>The goal of therapy in ITP is a safe platelet count, typically a count above 30,000/mcL, rather than a normal count. If it is not possible to taper prednisone off, or to a very low dose, while maintaining a safe platelet count, alternative therapies such as splenectomy or thrombopoietin analogues are indicated, since the long-term risks of corticosteroids (infections, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression, muscle weakness, electrolyte disturbances) should be avoided if possible.</p><a href=#chief-complaint-1><h3 id=chief-complaint-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. J is a 62-year-old man who underwent a coronary bypass graft operation 1 week ago for severe coronary artery disease.

Therefore, the first steps in diagnosing thrombocytopenia in a hospitalized patient are to review previous platelet counts to determine whether the thrombocytopenia is new, review the medication list, and look for vital signs suggestive of sepsis. Because Mr. J has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, it is also important to consider autoimmune thrombocytopenia as an accompanying autoimmune phenomenon (also called Evans syndrome, characterized by seeing spherocytes rather than schistocytes in the peripheral smear), although this would otherwise be uncommon in his age group. Finally, he could have cirrhosis due to his extensive alcohol intake over the years, with hypersplenism causing mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia. Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia might also cause splenic enlargement. If hypersplenism is the cause, his platelet count at admission would probably have been somewhat low, typically between 40,000/mcL and 120,000/mcL.

Her medications include spironolactone and metoprolol; additionally, she has been taking ibuprofen for back pain.</p><p>On examination, she is pale. Her blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 112 bpm, RR is 16 breaths per minute, temperature is 37.1°C. Her conjunctivae are pale, mucous membranes moist, lungs clear, heart regular rhythm with a systolic flow murmur at the left sternal border, liver minimally enlarged with a nodular edge, spleen palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin in the anterior axillary line, and she has no edema. Digital rectal examination discloses black stool that is Hemoccult-positive.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><p>Ms. W’s presentation suggests that she is having an upper GI bleed. In addition to the specific GI causes of upper GI bleeding discussed in Chapter 19, GI Bleeding, it is important to consider whether patients who are bleeding have an underlying platelet or coagulation disorder contributing to the bleeding. Ms. W does have cirrhosis with splenomegaly that could lead to thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration; however, the large volume of the bleeding suggests a coagulation factor disorder.</p><p>The prothrombin time (PT) measures what is commonly called the “extrinsic” clotting pathway (Figure 8-2), wherein tissue factor from an injury activates factor VII, followed by activation of the coagulation cascade through the “common pathway” factors (factors V, X, II [prothrombin] and I [fibrinogen]). Because the source of tissue factor reagents used in the laboratory to trigger the cascade vary, the PT will vary among different laboratories when testing the same sample. To overcome this problem of PT results not being comparable from one laboratory to another, the international normalized ratio (INR) was developed, to standardize PT results based on a constant associated with each laboratory reagent. The INR, which is routinely reported along with the PT, allows the clinician to be confident that the data from different laboratories are comparable.</p><p><strong>Figure 8-2.</strong> The coagulation cascade. Organization of the coagulation system based on current assays. The <strong>intrinsic</strong> coagulation system consists of the proteins factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII and prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). The <strong>extrinsic</strong> coagulation system consists of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin) and factor VII. The <strong>common pathway</strong> of the coagulation system consists of factors X, V, and II, and fibrinogen (I). (Reproduced with permission from McPherson RA, Pincus MR: Henry’s Clinical Diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods, 22nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier/Saunders; 2011.)</p><p>The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measures what is commonly called the “intrinsic” clotting pathway, starting with factor XII and working through factors XI, IX, and VIII before entering the common pathway.</p><p>In the evaluation of a prolonged clotting time, either PT or aPTT, one considers whether only one test is prolonged, and which factors contribute to each test. For example, an isolated prolonged PT suggests a deficiency or inhibitor of factor VII, since that is the only factor unique to the PT assay. An isolated prolonged aPTT raises concern about the 4 factors that are unique to the aPTT—factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Prolongation of both the PT and aPTT raises concern either about the factors in the common pathway—I, II, V, and X—or a defect in multiple factors. Table 8-3 summarizes commonly seen patterns of factor deficiencies.</p><p><strong>Table 8-3.</strong> Common factor deficiency patterns.</p><p>In clinical practice, prolongation of clotting times is most commonly acquired, either due to acquired deficiencies (eg, from malnutrition or liver disease) or acquired factor inhibitors. (While congenital factor deficiencies such as hemophilia certainly cause prolonged clotting times, these are far less commonly seen, and patients are generally well aware of them, making complex diagnostic evaluations unnecessary.) In order to distinguish between a factor deficiency and an inhibitor, it is often helpful to perform a mixing study, wherein one mixes 1:1 the patient’s plasma and normal plasma, to see if the clotting time corrects. If it does correct, the normal plasma has provided the missing factor to the patient’s plasma, indicating the abnormality is due to a factor deficiency. If it does not correct, the implication is that an inhibitor in the patient’s plasma is inactivating the clotting factor(s) from the normal plasma. Such inhibitors may be exogenous, such as inadvertent heparin in the mixture; or endogenous, such as an acquired factor inhibitory antibody.</p><p>Based on the data we have so far, Ms. W’s GI bleeding is most likely from the upper GI tract, probably gastritis or ulceration induced by use of the NSAID ibuprofen. Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension often develop esophageal and gastric varices, which can also be a cause of bleeding. The severity of the bleeding may be exacerbated by a coagulopathy related to her cirrhosis. The history of poor appetite for a few weeks raises the consideration of vitamin K deficiency due to lack of intake, and the presence of splenomegaly on examination suggests that thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration may also be contributing.</p><p>Table 8-4 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 8-4.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. W.</p><p>A CBC shows WBC 9400/mcL, Hb 7.8 g/dL, platelet count 76,000/mcL. A chemistry profile shows mild elevation of the transaminases but is otherwise normal. Her CBC 6 months ago showed an Hb of 11.7 g/dL and platelet count of 80,000/mcL. Coagulation studies include a PT of 22 seconds (normal range 11–13 seconds), with an INR of 1.8 (normal 0.9–1.2). The aPTT is 39 seconds (normal 24–34 seconds).</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><p>Ms. W has the stable, moderate thrombocytopenia generally seen in patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism. Moderate thrombocytopenia such as this does not substantially increase the risk of bleeding, especially not the large volume GI bleeding she is experiencing.

Patients may be asymptomatic, only discovered to have a coagulopathy incidentally on coagulation laboratory studies.

Factor VIII is typically normal or even elevated in liver disease, a finding that may distinguish liver disease from DIC, in which factor VIII is low.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Another finding that may contribute to bleeding risk in severe liver disease is excessive fibrinolysis, the cause of which is a complex interplay between the production of and hepatic clearance of fibrinolytic activators and inhibitors.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  While it may seem paradoxical, there may also be an increased risk of thrombosis in liver disease.

href=#textbook-presentation-5><h5 id=textbook-presentation-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, also called consumptive coagulopathy) is a catastrophic activation of the coagulation system that classically presents as the abrupt onset of uncontrolled spontaneous diffuse bleeding from multiple sites (venipuncture sites, catheter sites, endotracheal tubes, recent surgical sites) in patients with severe illness such as shock states, major trauma, sepsis, obstetric emergencies, and advanced cancer.</p><a href=#disease-highlights-5><h5 id=disease-highlights-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  The common denominator of conditions that cause DIC is tissue injury and activation of the clotting cascade via entry of procoagulants into the circulation.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  A variety of conditions activate the clotting cascade.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Trauma</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Advanced adenocarcinomas of any site, such as colon, pancreas, or lung.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Obstetric crises such as amniotic fluid embolism or placental abruption.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Acute promyelocytic leukemia, wherein the granules of the malignant promyelocytes activate the clotting system.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Although the classic presentation is major bleeding due to activation of the clotting cascade leading to secondary consumption of clotting factors, in some cases clotting manifestations may predominate.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Patients with advanced cancer may have recurrent deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or arterial emboli in the extremities without signs of bleeding.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  This is considered chronic DIC.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Renal, hepatic, and pulmonary dysfunction may accompany acute DIC.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-5><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  In acute DIC, consumption of clotting factors is demonstrated by thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the PT/INR and aPTT, reduction of plasma fibrinogen level, and increases in D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDP).</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  The D-dimer and FDP reflect fibrinolytic activity acting upon fibrin formed during the clotting process.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  D-dimer is the product of lysis of cross-linked fibrin.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  FDP is the product of lysis of both fibrin and fibrinogen.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Fibrinogen levels below 100 mg/dL may correlate with bleeding risk.</p><p>If DIC is suspected, testing should include platelet count, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer.</p><a href=#treatment-5><h5 id=treatment-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Treat the underlying condition if possible.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Replete clotting factors that have been depleted, with platelet transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is particularly low.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  In rare instances, the use of low-dose heparin is considered. While it is logical to consider undertaking <em>anti</em>coagulation if the initiation of the process was coagulation, the additional bleeding risk is of great concern, and efforts are generally focused more on providing clotting factors while addressing the underlying cause.</p><a href=#case-resolution-2><h3 id=case-resolution-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>You instruct Ms. W to avoid all aspirin products and NSAIDs.
