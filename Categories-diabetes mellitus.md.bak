* Type 1 (Lancet 2018;391:2449): islet cell destruction; absolute insulin deficiency; ketosis in absence of insulin; prevalence 0.4%; usual onset in childhood but can occur throughout adulthood; ↑ risk if ⊕ FHx; HLA associations; anti-GAD, anti-islet cell & anti-insulin autoAb
* Type 2 (Lancet 2017;389:2239): insulin resistance + relative insulin ↓; prevalence 6%; onset generally later in life; no HLA assoc.; risk factors: age, ⊕ FHx, obesity, sedentary lifestyle
* Type 2 DM p/w DKA (“ketosis-prone diabetes” or “Flatbush diabetes”): most often seen in nonwhite, ± anti-GAD Ab, eventually may not require insulin (Endo Rev 2008;29:292)
* Mature-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY): autosomal dom. forms of DM due to defects in insulin secretion genes; genetically and clinically heterogeneous (JCEM 2021;106:237)
* Secondary causes of diabetes: exogenous glucocorticoids, glucagonoma (3 Ds = DM, DVT, diarrhea), pancreatic (pancreatitis, hemochromatosis, CF, resection), endocrino-pathies (Cushing’s, acromegaly), gestational, drugs (protease inhibitors, atypical antiψ)
