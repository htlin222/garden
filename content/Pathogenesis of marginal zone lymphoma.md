# Pathogenesis of marginal zone lymphoma

- Thought to arise from chronic Ag stimulation due to infectious pathogens or other causes of inflammation, including autoimmune diseases

- Variety of chromosomal translocations can result
	* in Ag-independent activation of
		* NF-Ò¡B pathway
			* (important signal for B cell survival)

- Whole genome sequencing of splenic MZL has
	* identified recurrent somatic Mts of
		* genes encoding chromatin-modifying enzymes & proteins
			* in the NOTCH, NF-ÎºB, & MYD88 pathways
				* (JEM 2012;209:1537; NEJM 2012;367:826)
