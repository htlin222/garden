# Summary-of-TAILORx

- The TAILORx trial showed that adjuvant endocrine therapy alone is â†’ noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer who have a midrange 21-gene recurrence score of **11 to 25**.
- The two treatment groups had similar rates of invasive disease-free survival, freedom from disease recurrence, and overall survival.
- However, some benefit of chemotherapy was found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16 to 25.
