## Initial diagnostic studies

- [[Focused history of chest pain]]
- Targeted exam: 
    - VS (incl. BP in both arms); 
    - gallops, murmurs, rubs; 
    - signs of vascular dis. (carotid/femoral bruits, ↓ pulses) or CHF; 
    - lung & abd. exam; 
    - chest wall for reproducibility
- 12-lead ECG: 
    - obtain w/in 10 min; 
    - compare to priors & obtain serial ECGs; 
    - consider posterior leads (V7–V9) if hx c/w ACS but stnd ECG unrevealing or ST ↓ V1–V3 & pain refractory
- [[Troponin]]

- CXR; other imaging (echo, PE CTA, etc.) as indicated based on H&P and initial testing

## Initial approach (Circ 2021;144:e368)

- R/o life-threatening causes (ACS, PE, AoD, myopericarditis, etc.)
- If possible ACS, risk stratify w/ clinician decision pathway (clinical factors + ECG + Tn)
- Low prob ACS (eg, H&P unconcerning, ⊖ ECG & Tn): d/c to home; risk factor mgmt
- Intermed prob ACS (neither low nor high clinical risk, ± borderline Tn): ✓ TTE and
  - If no known CAD → CCTA or stress (former ↓ LOS c/w fxnal testing; NEJM 2012;366:1393)
  - If recent mildly ⊕ stress or known non-obstructive CAD → CCTA
  - If obstructive but not high-risk CAD → stress test
  - If recent mod-severely ⊕ stress or high-risk CAD (LM, prox LAD, MVD) → invasive angio
- High prob ACS (eg, ECG Δs, ⊕ Tn, new ↓ LVEF): invasive coronary angiography
- Pts w/ acute CP: CCTA vs. stress testing → ↓ time to dx & LOS (less so in era of hsTn), but ↑ probability of cath/PCI (NEJM 2012;366:1393 & 367:299; JACC 2013;61:880)
