## Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Women with Midrange Recurrence Score of 21-Gene Breast Cancer Assay

1. Design:
   - Prospective trial
   - Multi-center
   - Randomized
2. Number of patients: 10,273 women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer
3. Patients characteristics:
   - Hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer
   - Midrange recurrence score of 11 to 25
4. Agent:
   - Endocrine therapy alone
   - Chemoendocrine therapy
5. Treatment line: Adjuvant therapy
6. Trial Name: TAILORx
7. Comparison of two groups:

   | Outcome | Endocrine therapy alone | Chemoendocrine therapy |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Invasive disease-free survival | Noninferior | Noninferior |
   | HR | 1.08 (95% CI, 0.94 to 1.24) | - |
   | p-value | 0.26 | - |
   | Overall survival | Similar | Similar |
   | Freedom from disease recurrence at â†£ a distant site | Similar | Similar |
   | Freedom from disease recurrence at â†£ a distant or local-regional site | Similar | Similar |
   | Chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival | Found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of 16 to 25 | - |

8. Other findings in this trial:
   - Endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar efficacy in women with midrange 21-gene recurrence score.
   - Chemotherapy benefit varied with the combination of recurrence score and age.
