# α1-antitrypsin deficiency (α1-AT)

 (J Hepatol 2016;65:413; NEJM 2020;382:1443)

* Abnl α1-AT → polymerization in liver (cirrhosis) & uninhibited protease activity in lung (emphysema). Affects 1/3000 of European ancestry. Varied presentations: neonatal hepatitis; cholestatic jaundice in children; ↑ AST/ALT or cirrhosis in children/adults.

* Extrahepatic disease: panlobular emphysema, necrotizing panniculitis, ANCA vasculitis

* Dx: serum α1-AT (acute phase reactant) w/ CRP level (to ensure not ↑ due to inflamm.)

* gold standard = phenotyping of protease inhibitor (Pi). Alleles most a/w hepatic dis.: Z (63% of ZZ adults have chronic liver dis. and liver fibrosis, may be present in 35% of ZZ individuals w/o overt liver disease) & M (malton) (J Hepatol 2018;69:1357). Liver bx shows characteristic PAS ⊕ cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.

* Treatment: ↓ risk by avoiding EtOH, maintaining a normal BMI; liver transplant if severe
