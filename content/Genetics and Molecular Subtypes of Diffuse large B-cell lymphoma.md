# Genetics and Molecular Subtypes of Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

- DNA expression analysis identifies three distinct subtypes:

  - [[germinal-center B-cell]] type (GCB),
  - activated B-cell type (ABC or non-GBC subtype),
  - & type 3 DLBCL (NEJM 2002;346:1937; Nature 2000;403:503).
  - ABC phenotype a/w older age, worse prognosis

- Immunohistochemical algorithms of DLBCL can be used in lieu of GEP classifying cases into GCB & non-GCB (w/o unclassifiable; Figure 23-1) (Blood 2004;103:275)

- High-grade B-cell lymphoma w/ _MYC & BCL2_ &/or BCL6 translocations by FISH (formerly “[[double-hit in DLBCL]]”) represent ∼8% of all DLBCL & have poorer prog. 
    - Almost always [[GCB]]. 
    - IHC detected “double expressors” (MYC >40% BCL2 >70%) may be assoc w/ ↓ prog (JCO 2012;30:3460). 
    - Burkitt typically BCL-2(−) vs. DLBCL nearly always BCL2(+)
- [[t(14:18)]] occurs in ∼30% of DLBCLs (common in follicular lymphoma); juxtaposes BCL-2 gene to the IgH gene. BCL-2+ IHC may be seen w/ or w/o this translocation
