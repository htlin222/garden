# Chemotherapy

## Chemotherapy

â€¢Â Â Â Cell cycle non-specific phase: Activity not dependent upon the agent being available during a certain phase of the cell cycle. May administer over a shorter period of time, but may need higher drug concentration (peak). See gray box in Figure 7.8.

â€¢Â Â Â Cell cycleâ€“specific phase: Activity is primarily in one phase of the cell cycle. Often need to administer over a longer period of time. See green and blue boxes in Figure 7.8.



**FIGURE 7.8: Cell cycle schematic and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents**. The cell cycle is divided into several different phases, which can vary in length depending on the type and growth rate of the cell. The activity of different classes of chemotherapy agents are optimal at different phases of the cell cycle, whereas other types of chemotherapy are cell cycle non-specific. Shown above are examples of different chemotherapy classes and specific agents. \*Mitoxantrone can be cell cycle specific at certain concentrations (e.g., primarily causes G2 arrest at lower concentrations but can cause both S and G2 arrest at higher concentrations).
