# Treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(Lancet 2016;388:73)
â€¢ Resectable: pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) + adjuvant chemo:
modified FOLFIRINOX (5-FU + leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) if ECOG 0-1
(NEJM 2018;379:2395), o/w gemcitabine + capecitabine (Lancet 2017;389:1011). Gemcitabine
monoRx recently standard, but now w/ â†“ role. Role of RT is controversial.
â€¢ Borderline: goal to â†“ tumor to allow complete resection (R0 â€“ neg margin at histology) using neoadjuvant Rx (various approaches tested). General schema: chemo Â± RT â†’ restage & potential resection depending on response. May need vasc. reconstruction during resection. Regimens include: FOLFIRINOX; gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel.
â€¢ Locally advanced (ie, unresectable): Rx is typically palliative. However, in highly select Pts recent trend toward Rx w/ FOLFIRINOX plus XRT followed by laparotomy for response assessment (imaging can be unreliable) and potential resection.
â€¢ Metastatic: clinical trials preferred; Rx based on performance status (PS)
Good PS: FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (NEJM 2013;369:1691); germline BRCA1/2 mut: maintenance olaparib (NEJM 2019;381:317) also â†‘ response to platinum combination chemo (eg, cisplatin w/ gemcitabine), ICI for MSI-high.
Poor PS: gemcitabine; capecitabine; continuous infusion 5-FU
â€¢ Palliative care: Biliary/gastric outlet obstruct.: endoscopic stenting, IR drain, surg bypass. Pain: opiates, celiac plexus neurolysis, XRT. Wt loss: enzyme replacement.
