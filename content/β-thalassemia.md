# β-thalassemia

mutations in β-globin gene → absent or ↓ gene product seen w/ Mediterranean (espec. Greek or Italian), African, or Asian ancestry

1 mutated β gene → thal minor (or trait) = mild anemia (no transfusions)

2 mutated β genes → thal intermedia (occasional transfusions) or thal major (= [[Cooley’s anemia]]; transfusion dependent) depending on severity of mutations



## Explain by ChatGPT


1. Mutations in the β-globin gene can lead to absent or decreased production of the gene product. This is seen most commonly in people of Mediterranean (especially Greek or Italian), African, or Asian ancestry.

2. One mutated β gene can lead to thalassemia minor (or trait), which is a mild form of anemia that does not require transfusions.

2. Two mutated β genes can lead to either thalassemia intermedia (occasional transfusions) or thalassemia major (transfusion dependent), depending on the severity of the mutations.

1. β-珠蛋白基因突變可導致基因產物缺失或產量下降。這在地中海（尤其是希臘或意大利）、非洲或亞洲血統的人群中最為常見。

2. 一個突變的 β 基因可導致輕微地中海貧血（或性狀），這是一種不需要輸血的輕度貧血。

2. 兩個突變的 β 基因可導致中間型地中海貧血（偶爾輸血）或重型地中海貧血（依賴輸血），具體取決於突變的嚴重程度。
