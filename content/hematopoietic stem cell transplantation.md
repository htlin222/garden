## Chronic Active Antibody-Mediated Rejection (ABMR)

- Diagnosis requires:
  - Morphologic evidence of chronic tissue injury (e.g. transplant glomerulopathy)
  - Evidence of current or recent antibody interaction with the vascular endothelium (e.g. linear C4d staining of peritubular capillaries)
  - Serologic evidence of donor-specific antibody (DSA) formation.
