# Initial Treatment: Transplant Eligible Patients of mantle cell lymphoma

- No generally accepted standard of care; clinical trial enrollment encouraged
- In pts who require Rx & can tolerate it, an upfront autologous transplant approach is favored by most groups (Blood 2005;105:2677)
- Pts typically receive alternating or sequential schedules of multiagent chemotherapy. Rituximab is included in all cycles of chemotherapy. Inclusion of high-dose cytarabine (alone or in combination) as part of chemotherapy has been shown to improve outcomes.
- Alternating schedules include (eg, R-Hyper-CVAD (JCO 2005;23:7013) & Nordic MCL-2 (R-Maxi-CHOP alt. R-HiDAC, Blood 2008 112:2687)
- Sequential schedules include R-CHOP Ã£ R-DHAP (Blood 2013;112:48) or R-CHOP Ã£ R-ICE (Ann Oncol 2010;21:133)
- Rituximab maintenance improves PFS & OS after R-DHAP â†’ HDT/ASCR (LyMa trial, ASH 2016, #145)
