# Enfortumab vedotin

[[kfsyscc-of-Enfortumab vedotin]]

- Mechanism:
  - Anti-Nectin 4 human IgG1;
  - after binding, internalized ADC releases antimicrotubule agent MMAE, producing cell cycle arrest/apoptosis
- Approved indication:
  - Urothelial cancer
- Dosing:
  - 1.25 mg/kg (max 125 mg) IV d 1, 8, & 15 of 28-d cycles;
  - avoid use in mod./sev. hepatic impairment;
  - no adjustment for renal impairment;
  - manufacturer-recommended dose reductions available for toxicity
- PK/PD:
  - T1/2 3.4 d for ADC, 2.4 d for MMAE;
  - MMAE metabolized hepatically (CYP3A4)
- Adverse effects (AEs):
  - Skin rxns (mostly maculopapular rash/pruritus, some sev. rxns),
  - hyperglycemia,
  - peripheral neuropathy,
  - ocular disorders (mostly corneal),
  - alopecia,
  - diarrhea,
  - dysgeusia,
  - low vomiting risk,
  - myelosuppression
- DDI: Strong [[CYP3A4]] inhibitors/inducers likely increase/decrease MMAE exposure; no specific dose adjustments recommended; MMAE is a P-glycoprotein substrate

## Clinical pearls

- Prophylactic artificial tears suggested;
- median 3.8 mos to grade ≥2 neuropathy, 1.9 mos to ocular disorders
