At least it is not difficult to obtain a basic understanding of the art — and <em>apply</em> this understanding to interpreting the <em>majority</em> of 12-lead ECGs and arrhythmias that you will encounter. The most difficult part of electrocardiography is learning (<em>and then remembering</em>) the various criteria used to diagnose complex ECG findings such as chamber enlargement and bundle branch block.</p><ul><li>Practically speaking — **<em>there is much less to learn <em><strong>(<em>and memorize</em>)</strong></em></em> <em><strong>than most people think</strong></em>. Herein lies the <em>secret</em> of the ECG *Pocket *Brain: it facilitates understanding of basic ECG concepts and <em>lightens</em> the &ldquo;memory load&rdquo; — by providing <em>ready</em> recall of those <em>KEY</em> facts and figures needed for successful 12-lead interpretation.</li><li>We have ***completely ***<strong>revised</strong> and <em><strong>updated</strong></em> this <strong>6th Edition</strong> (2014) of our book. We have more than doubled our content — enhanced our explanations — and have greatly improved the quality of our figures. This book now stands as an <em>independent</em> concise text on key aspects of ECG interpretation.</li><li><em><strong>Development</strong></em> of <em><strong>this</strong></em> <strong>ePub</strong> takes ECG-2014-PB (<em>Expanded</em>) to a <em>higher</em> level. Nothing beats the instant access of a well organized electronic file.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Our goal is <em>to provide key information fast</em>.

We <em>intentionally</em> place this <strong>ECG</strong> <em><strong>Crib</strong></em>** Sheet** <em>before</em> Section 01.0 — so that it will be <em>easy</em> to access.</p><ul><li>For readers who are <em>less</em> experienced in <em>systematic</em> ECG interpretation — We suggest you refer <strong>often</strong> to this ECG Crib Sheet. This will <strong>facilitate</strong> <em><strong>ready</strong></em>** recall** of the 6 <em>KEY</em> parameters in the <em><strong>Systematic</strong></em> <strong>Approach</strong> (<em>= Rate-Rhythm-Intervals-Axis-Hypertrophy-QRST Changes</em>).</li><li>With <em>regular</em> use — You’ll <em>quickly</em> learn the information contained within this ECG Crib Sheet. In case there is something you forget — the Crib Sheet is always here for a quick refresher.</li><li><strong>HINT:</strong> Making a bookmark — <em><strong>Searching</strong></em> for, “<strong>00.6</strong>” — or simply <em>scrolling</em> to the front of this ePub are <em>easy</em> ways to rapidly access the ECG Crib Sheet.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>All</em> parameters in our <em>Systematic</em> Approach to ECG interpretation are discussed in detail throughout the pages of this ePub. We begin with <strong>Section 01.0</strong> on <em>Review of Basics</em> — and continue through to Section 14.0. <em><strong>We simply want you to know</strong></em> that this ECG <em>Crib</em> Sheet (<em>Section 00.6</em>) and Section 00.7 that follows (<em>which reviews the 6 Essential Lists</em>) — are <em><strong>located</strong></em> at the very <em><strong>front</strong></em> of this <strong>ePub</strong> in order to facilitate your <em>ready</em> access to this material.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>00.6.2 – The</strong> <em><strong>Systematic</strong></em>** Approach:** <em><strong>Rate & Rhythm</strong></em></p><ul><li>The first 2 parameters in the <em><strong>Systematic</strong></em> <strong>Approach</strong> are Rate and Rhythm. They are discussed in detail in <strong>Section 02.0</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>RATE</strong> — If the rhythm is regular — <em><strong>rate</strong></em> can easily be determined by the “Rule of 300”. Divide 300 by the number of boxes in R-R Interval (<em>Section 02.2</em>).</p><ul><li>IF the rhythm is <em><strong>regular</strong></em> and <strong>rapid</strong> — rate can be accurately estimated by the <em>every-other-beat</em> method (<em>Section 02.31</em>) — in which you figure out the rate for every-other-beat (<em>which is half the rate</em>); and then <em>double</em> this number.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>RHYTHM</strong> — First <em><strong>ensure</strong></em> that the patient is <em><strong>hemodynamically</strong></em> <strong>stable</strong>. Then assess the 5 <em>KEY</em> components for rhythm. These are conveniently remembered by the phrase: ***Watch your <em><strong><strong>P&rsquo;s</strong></strong></em> & <em><strong><strong>Q&rsquo;s</strong></strong></em> — and the ***<strong>3 R&rsquo;s</strong> (<em>Section 02.1</em>).</p><ul><li>Are there <strong>P waves</strong>? If so — Are P waves <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in <strong>lead II?</strong></li><li>P waves should <em>always</em> be <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in <strong>lead II</strong> IF there is sinus rhythm (<em>unless there is lead reversal or dextrocardia</em>).</li><li>Is the <strong>QRS</strong> complex wide or narrow?</li><li>What is the <strong>Rate</strong>?</li><li>Is the rhythm <strong>Regular</strong>?</li><li>Are P waves <strong>Related</strong> (ie, <em>&ldquo;married&rdquo; with fixed PR interval</em>) to the QRS? If P waves are “married” — then they are being conducted to the ventricles.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>00.6.3 – Parameter #3:</strong> <em><strong>Intervals</strong></em></p><p><strong>INTERVALS</strong> — Look at intervals at an <em>early</em> point in the process!</p><ul><li>The <strong>PR Interval</strong> — is <em>prolonged</em> IF >0.20-0.21 second (<em>if clearly more than a LARGE box in duration</em>) — <em>Section 04.0</em>.</li><li>The <strong>QRS Complex</strong> — is <em>wide</em> IF >0.10 sec. (*if more than HALF a large *box in duration) — <em>Section 05.0</em>.</li><li>The <strong>QT Interval</strong> — is *prolonged *IF clearly <em>more</em> than <em>half</em> the R-R interval (<em>provided that heart rate is not more than 100 beats/minute</em>) — <em>Section 06.0</em>. If the QT interval is prolonged — Think of *“Drugs-Lytes-CNS” *(= <strong>List #3</strong>) as the possible cause(s) of QT prolongation (<em>Section 06.2</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><strong>KEY Clinical Point:</strong></em> <strong>—</strong> IF the rhythm is sinus but the QRS is wide — then <em><strong>STOP</strong></em> <em>before</em> going further. Figure out <em>WHY</em> the QRS is wide — be this due to RBBB, LBBB, IVCD, WPW (<em>Section 05.2</em>). Criteria for infarction, ischemia, and chamber enlargement will all be <em>different</em> IF there is a conduction defect. This is the reason for determining <em>early on</em> the cause of QRS widening.</p><p><strong>00.6.4 – Parameter #4:</strong> <em><strong>Axis</strong></em></p><ul><li>Axis is discussed in detail in <strong>Section 07.0</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>AXIS</strong> <strong>—</strong>* <em>Determine the axis quadrant by looking at</em> *<strong>lead I (<em><strong>at 0 degrees</strong></em>)</strong> and <strong>lead aVF</strong> <strong>(<em><strong>at +90 degrees</strong></em>)</strong>:</p><ul><li>The axis is ***normal ***<em>—</em> IF the <em>net</em> QRS deflection is <em>positive</em> in leads I and aVF (<em>this defines the axis to be between 0 degrees to +90 degrees</em>).</li><li>There is <strong>RAD</strong> <em>—</em>*** ***IF the <em>net</em> QRS deflection is <em>negative</em> in I but <em>positive</em> in aVF (<em>Think RVH, LPHB or normal variant as the common causes for RAD</em>).</li><li>There is <strong>LAD</strong> <em>—</em> IF the <em>net</em> QRS is <em>positive</em> in I but <em>negative</em> in aVF. There is <em>pathologic LAD <em>= <strong>LAHB</strong> (<em>Left Anterior HemiBlock</em>)</em></em>** — IF the <em>net</em> QRS deflection is more <em>negative</em> than positive in lead II (<em>Section 07.13</em>).</li><li>The axis is ***indeterminate — ***IF the <em>net</em> QRS deflection is <em>negative</em> in leads I and aVF (<em>Think RVH, COPD, obesity as the common causes of an indeterminate axis</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>00.6.5 – Parameter #5:</strong> <em><strong>Chamber Enlargement</strong></em>****</p><ul><li>Chamber Enlargement is discussed in detail in <strong>Section 08.0</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>HYPERTROPHY</strong> (<em>Chamber Enlargement</em>):</p><ul><li>The &ldquo;<em>magic numbers&rdquo;</em> for <strong>LVH</strong> are <strong>35</strong> (sum of the <em>deepest</em> S wave in V1,V2**** — ***plus *<em><strong>— <em>the <em>tallest</em> R wave in V5,V6 — <em>in a patient at least</em></em></strong> 35 <em><strong><em>years of age</em>) — and <strong>12</strong> (<em>for R wave amplitude in lead aVL</em>) — <em>Section 08.1</em>. True chamber enlargement is <em>much</em> more likely IF <em><strong>&ldquo;strain&rdquo;</strong></em></strong></em></em> also present!</li><li>There is <strong>RAA</strong> (<em>P Pulmonale</em>) —**** IF P waves are <strong>p</strong>rominent (<em>≥2.5 mm tall</em>) and <strong>p</strong>eaked (ie, <em>&ldquo;uncomfortable to sit on&rdquo;</em>) in the <em><strong>p</strong></em><em>ulmonary</em> leads (<em>II, III, and aVF</em>) — <em>Section 08.19</em>.</li><li>There is <strong>LAA</strong> (<em>P Mitrale</em>) — IF P waves are <em>notched</em> (<em>&ldquo;m&rdquo;-shaped</em>) in <strong>m</strong>itral leads (<em>I, II, or aVL</em>) — or if the P wave in V1 has a <em>deep</em> terminal <em>negative</em> component — <em>Section 08.20</em>.</li><li>Consider <em><strong>pulmonary</strong></em>** disease** — IF there is RAA, RAD (<em>or indeterminate axis</em>), incomplete RBBB (<em>or rSr’ pattern in lead V1</em>), low voltage, or persistent precordial S waves — <em>Section 08.24</em>.</li><li>Consider <strong>RVH</strong> — IF there is <em>also</em> a tall R wave in V1 <em>and/or</em> right ventricular &ldquo;strain&rdquo; — <em>Section 08.24</em>.</li><li>Criteria for LVH/RVH are <em>different</em> when there is BBB (<em>Sections 05.31 and 05.32</em>).</li><li>Consider <strong>acute</strong> <em><strong>pulmonary</strong></em>** embolus** — IF the ECG shows signs of acute <em>right</em> heart strain (<em>Section 08.34</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>00.6.6 – Parameter #6:</strong> ***Infarct ***<strong>(= Q-R-S-T Changes)</strong></p><ul><li>Assessment of QRST Changes is discussed in detail in <strong>Section 09.0</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>INFARCT</strong> <strong>(</strong>*= ***<em>Q-R-S-T <em><em><strong>changes</strong></em>)</em></em> — Look at <em>all</em> 12 leads on the ECG to assess for QRST Changes.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong> <strong>aVR</strong> will usually be <em><strong>globally</strong></em>** negative** under <em>normal</em> circumstances (<em>negative P wave, QRS and T wave</em>). We therefore <em>expect</em> to see a Q wave and T wave inversion in lead aVR as part of a normal ECG.</li><li>The finding of an <em>upright</em> P, QRS and T wave in lead aVR should suggest the possibility of <em><strong>lead</strong></em> <strong>misplacement</strong> (<em>especially if lead I manifests global negativity</em>) — <em>Section 03.10</em>.</li><li>For the <em>more</em> experienced interpreter — We suggest review of Sections 09.31-through-09.39, which highlight situations for which <strong>attention</strong> to <em><strong>lead</strong></em> <strong>aVR</strong> may provide important additional information.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Localization</em> of the <em><strong>Basic</strong></em>** Lead Groups** is shown in Figure 00.6.6-1.

IF the patient is unstable — <em>immediately</em> cardiovert! But IF the patient in WCT (<em>Wide-Complex Tachycardia</em>) is stable — you have at least a *moment *of time to contemplate management.</li><li>Always <em><strong>assume</strong></em> a <em>regular</em> WCT rhythm is <strong>VT</strong> <em><strong>until</strong></em>** proven otherwise** (Figure 00.7.2-1). This is true <em>regardless</em> of whether the patient is hypotensive or alert with a systolic BP>160mmHg. Some patients may be stable and alert <em>despite</em> remaining in VT for hours (<em>or even days</em>)!</li><li>The reason we list <strong>VT</strong> as the <em><strong>first</strong></em>** 8 causes** in <strong>LIST #1</strong> (Figure 00.7.2-1) is twofold: <strong>i)</strong> VT is the <em>worst</em> thing the WCT could be; and <strong>ii)</strong> Statistically — <em>at least</em> 80-90% of cases of WCT of <em>uncertain</em> etiology will turn out to be VT.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 00.7.2-1:</strong> LIST #1 = Causes of a Monomorphic <em>Regular</em> WCT. Always <em>assume</em> VT until <em>proven</em> otherwise.</p><p><strong>00.7.3 – LIST #2: Common Causes of a</strong> ***Regular ***<strong>SVT:</strong></p><ul><li>LIST #2 is discussed in detail in Section 02.52.</li><li>We define the term, <strong>“SVT”</strong> — as a <em>rapid</em> rhythm (<em>rate >100/minute</em>) in which the <strong>QRS</strong> complex is <strong>narrow</strong> (<em>not more than 0.10 second</em>) in <em>all</em> 12 leads. The <strong>3 entities</strong> included in <strong>LIST #2</strong> (Figure 00.7.3-1) make up <em>over</em> 90% of the causes of a <em><strong>regular</strong></em>** SVT** seen by primary care or emergency providers.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Awareness of the <strong>usual</strong> <em><strong>rate</strong></em>** ranges** for these 3 common causes of SVT may help with distinction between them:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Sinus</strong></em> <strong>Tachycardia</strong> — *rarely *exceeds 160/minute in adults (<em>children may have sinus tachycardia at much faster rates</em>).</li><li>***Untreated **<em><strong>Atrial</strong> <strong>Flutter</strong> —</em> <em>usually conducts with <strong>2:1 ratio</strong>. Since the atrial rate of <em>untreated</em> atrial flutter is almost always <em>close</em> to <strong>300/minute</strong> (<em>250-350/minute is the range</em>) —</em> *this means that the <em>ventricular</em> response to AFlutter will usually be <em><strong>between</strong></em> <strong>140-to-160/minute</strong>.</li><li>As a result — IF a <em>regular <em>SVT in an adult is <em>faster than</em> 160-170/minute — it is most likely to be PSVT (</em>= AVNRT = AtrioVentricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia</em>).</li><li>On the other hand —* *A <em>regular</em> SVT rhythm at a rate <em>under</em> 160-170/minute could be <em>any</em> of the 3 entities on LIST #2 (Fig. 00.7.3-1).</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> A <em><strong>vagal</strong></em> <strong>maneuver</strong> or use of Adenosine* <em>(</em>= chemical Valsalva*) — may help in making a definitive diagnosis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 00.7.3-1:</strong> LIST #2 = Causes of a <em>Regular</em> SVT.</p><p><strong>00.7.4 – LIST #3: Common Causes of QT Prolongation:</strong></p><ul><li>LIST #3 is discussed in detail in Section 06.2.</li><li>Be aware that <em>in addition</em> to the <strong>3 entities</strong> in <strong>LIST #3</strong> (Figure 00.7.4-1) — ischemia/MI/BBB may <em>all</em> lengthen the QT. That said — IF the <em>only</em> ECG abnormality on the tracing is a *long *QT — *Think *<em><strong>“Drugs-Lytes-CNS”</strong></em> as the likely cause. Then — <em>correlate</em> clinically.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many <em><strong>combinations</strong></em> of <strong>drugs</strong> may contribute to <em>lengthening</em> the QT interval. These potential <em>drug-drug</em> interactions extend <em>beyond</em> the scope of this ECG-ePub and are <em>not</em> reflected in List #3. Suffice it to say that risk of QT prolongation (<em>and risk of Torsades</em>) is generally <em>minimal</em> — IF an otherwise <em>healthy</em> adult takes a <em>single</em> new drug for a <em>limited</em> period of time. Risk goes up when <em>several</em> agents are taken — especially if the drugs utilize the p450 system for metabolism and the patient has other <em>underlying</em> medical problems that may <em>predispose</em> to Torsades. <strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> Consider the possibility of <strong>Drugs</strong> (<em>or drug-drug interactions</em>) — as one of the main clinical causes of QT prolongation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 00.7.4-1:</strong> LIST #3 = Causes of a <em>Prolonged</em> QT.</p><p><strong>00.7.5 – LIST #4: Common Causes of ST Segment Depression:</strong></p><ul><li>LIST #4 is discussed in detail in Section 09.26.</li><li>There are <em>over</em> 50 causes of ST depression.

We often begin with that parameter that is <em>easiest</em> to assess (<em>be this presence of P waves, QRS width or regularity</em>).</p><ul><li>First — <em>Ensure</em> that the <strong>patient</strong> is <em><strong>hemodynamically</strong></em> <strong>stable</strong> (<em>precise rhythm diagnosis is of secondary importance if the patient is acutely decompensating and about to code</em>). <em><strong>Always</strong></em> <em><strong>look at the patient first</strong></em> <em>— before</em> beginning to study the rhythm.</li><li>IF there is normal <em><strong>sinus</strong></em> <strong>rhythm</strong> — then <strong>P</strong> waves should be present and clearly <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in <strong>lead II</strong> (<em>See Section 02.3</em>).</li><li>In adults, the <strong>Q</strong>RS is defined as ***narrow ***— IF it is <strong>≤0.10 second</strong> = <em>not</em> more than <em>HALF</em> a <em>large</em> box in duration (<strong>Figure 02.1-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.1-1:</strong> Is the QRS wide?

Vertically — each <em>little</em> box is 1 mm in amplitude (<em>a measurement we will use often in assessing for chamber enlargement</em>).</li><li>As seen in Figure 02.2-1 — the time required to record each <em><strong>large</strong></em> <strong>box</strong> on ECG grid paper is <strong>0.20 second</strong>. That**** is**** —**** there are <strong>5</strong> <em><strong>little</strong></em>** boxes** in each <em><strong>large</strong></em>** box**, and 5 <strong>X</strong> 0.04 second <strong>= 0.20 second (</strong> = 1/5th of a second**)**.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.2-1:</strong>* Deriving* the <em><strong>“Rule of 300”</strong></em> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>Thus, the time required to record** 5** <em><strong>large</strong></em>** boxes** will be one <em>full</em> second (<em>0.20 X 5</em> = <strong>1.0 sec</strong>). IF a QRS complex occurs each large box (<em>as in <em>Figure 02.2-1) — then the R-R interval will be 0.20 second — and the <em><strong>rate</strong></em> of the rhythm is <strong>300 beats/minute</strong> (ie, <em>5 beats occur each second <strong><strong>X</strong></strong> 60 seconds/minute</em> =</em></em>** a rate of 300/minute).</p><ul><li>IF the R-R interval is <strong>2</strong> <em><strong>large</strong></em> <strong>boxes</strong> — then the <em><strong>rate</strong></em> will be <em>half</em> as fast (ie, <em>300 ÷ 2 = <strong><strong>150</strong></strong> beats/minute</em>).</li><li>IF the R-R is <strong>3</strong> boxes, the rate = <strong>100</strong>/minute (<em>300/3</em>).</li><li>IF the R-R is <strong>4</strong> boxes, the rate = <strong>75</strong>/min (<em>300/4</em>) …</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> — Use the <em><strong>every-other-beat</strong></em>** method** when the rhythm is regular and the rate is fast (<em>See Section 02.31</em>).</p><hr><p><strong>02.3 –</strong> <em><strong>How to Define Sinus Rhythm?</strong></em></p><p>By definition (<em>under normal circumstances, assuming the heart lies in the left side of the thorax</em>) — the <strong>P wave</strong> should always be <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in standard <strong>lead II</strong> when the mechanism of the rhythm is <strong>sinus</strong>. This is because the overall direction of the electrical depolarization wavefront as it travels from the SA node toward the AV node and the ventricles is oriented <em>toward</em> standard lead II, which lies at +60 degrees in the frontal plane (<strong>Panel A</strong>* in *<strong>Figure 02.3-1</strong>).</p><ul><li>The <em>only</em> 2 exceptions to the above stated rule (ie, <em>when the rhythm may still be sinus <em>despite</em> a negative P wave in lead II</em>) are: <strong>i)</strong> if there is dextrocardia; or <strong>ii)</strong> if there is lead misplacement.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.3-1:</strong>* *IF the rhythm is <strong>sinus</strong> — then the P wave should <em>always</em> be <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in <strong>lead II</strong> (Panel A). The <em>only</em> exception is IF there is <em>dextrocardia</em> or lead misplacement. Therefore — Panel B is <em>not</em> a sinus rhythm (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>In contrast to the situation with sinus rhythm — the P wave will <em>not</em> be positive (<em>upright</em>) in lead II when the electrical impulse originates from the AV node (<strong>Panel B</strong>* in *Figure 02.3-1). Instead — spread of atrial activation is now directed <em>away</em> from lead II.</p><ul><li>Therefore, with junctional beats or junctional (<em>AV nodal</em>) rhythm — a <em><strong>negative</strong></em>** P wave** may be seen to precede the QRS complex in <strong>lead II (<strong>Panel B <em>in Fig. 02.3-1</em></strong>)</strong>.</li><li>Alternatively (<em>with AV nodal rhythm</em>) — a negative P wave may <em>follow</em> the QRS or <em>no P wave at all</em> is seen in lead II.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.4 – FIGURE 02.4-1:</strong> <em><strong>Is the Rhythm Sinus?</strong></em></p><p>Interpret the 3 rhythm strips shown in <strong>Figure 02.4-1</strong>.</p><ul><li>How can you tell <em>at a glance</em> IF the rhythm is sinus? (<em>Assume no dextrocardia <em>and</em> no lead misplacement</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.4-1:</strong>* How to tell* IF the rhythm is sinus?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.4-1:</strong> The very **<em>1st <em><strong><strong>thing</strong> we do when assessing <em>any</em> cardiac rhythm or 12-lead ECG is to look for a lead II rhythm strip. It takes <em>no more</em> than 2 brief seconds to <strong>look in front of</strong> <em><strong>each</strong></em></strong> QRS in lead II</em></em>.</p><ul><li><strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 02.4-1)**** — Regular <em>upright</em> P waves precede each QRS with <em>fixed</em> PR interval in this lead II. Therefore — there is <strong>NSR</strong> (<em>Normal Sinus Rhythm</em>). The QRS is narrow (<em>not more than half a large box</em>) — and the ventricular rhythm is regular with an R-R interval just <em>under</em> 4 large boxes in duration. IF the R-R interval was precisely 4 large boxes in duration — then by the <em><strong>Rule of 300</strong></em> the rate would be 300/4 = 75/minute (<em>Section 02.2</em>). Since the R-R interval is slightly <em>less</em> than 4 large boxes in duration — the rate must be slightly <em>faster</em> than 75/minute, or about <strong>78/minute</strong>.</li><li><strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 02.4-1)**** — does <em>not</em> represent sinus rhythm. It can’t (<em>provided there is no dextrocardia or lead misplacement</em>) — since the QRS in lead II is <em>not</em> preceded by an upright P wave. Whether the rhythm in Panel B represents AV nodal or low atrial rhythm is <em>less</em> important. The <em>KEY</em> point — is that the rhythm is <em>not</em> sinus!</li><li>Otherwise — the QRS is narrow and the rhythm is regular with an R-R interval of 4 large boxes in duration. Therefore — the rate = 300/4 = <strong>75/minute</strong>. The <em>negative</em> P waves in this lead II <em>are</em> conducting — because the PR interval preceding each QRS is fixed!</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 02.4-1)**** — is <em>not</em> a sinus rhythm (<em>since no P wave at all is seen</em>). The QRS is narrow and the rhythm is regular with an R-R interval of 6 large boxes. Therefore, the rate = 300/6 = <strong>50/minute</strong>. This is an <strong>AV</strong> <em><strong>nodal</strong></em>** rhythm** (<em>See Sections 02.32-to 02.34</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.5 –</strong> ***Sinus Mechanism ***<strong>Rhythms/Arrhythmias</strong></p><p>Once the mechanism of the rhythm is defined as “sinus” — the rate (<em>and regularity</em>) of the rhythm determine our terminology. There are 4 principal <em>sinus</em> mechanism rhythms (<strong>Figure 02.5-1</strong>):</p><ul><li><strong>NSR</strong> (<em>Normal Sinus Rhythm</em>) — regular rhythm with a rate <em>between</em> 60-99/minute in an adult (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 02.5-1). Norms for rate differ in children (<em>Section 02.6</em>).</li><li><strong>Sinus Bradycardia</strong> — regular sinus rhythm at a rate *below *60/minute (<strong>Panel B</strong>). The rate here is 50/minute.</li><li><strong>Sinus Tachycardia</strong> — sinus rhythm at a rate of 100/minute or <em>faster</em> in an adult (<strong>Panel C</strong> <em>in Fig. 02.5-1</em>).</li><li><strong>Sinus Arrhythmia</strong> — an <em>irregular</em> rhythm <em>despite</em> the presence of a sinus mechanism (<strong>Figure 02.7-1</strong> — <em>Section 02.7</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.5-1:</strong>* *Sinus mechanism rhythms (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>02.6 – Norms for Children:</strong> <em><strong>Different than Adults</strong></em></p><p>Normal limits for heart rate are <em>different</em> in children. While we primarily concern ourselves with the adult ECG in this book — it is nevertheless helpful to be aware of some differences between pediatric and adult findings.</p><ul><li>Rate limits are <em><strong>different</strong></em> <strong>in children</strong> — with “norms” depending on the age of the child. Much more important than specific “cut-off” points for each age category — is appreciation of the general concept that <em>slightly</em> faster rates (<em>say ~110/minute</em>) may be normal for a crying but otherwise healthy young child. By the same token — a rate within the “seemingly normal” range of 65/minute might be relatively <em>slow</em> for an active young child. <em>Clinical context is everything!</em></li><li>Upper limits for <strong>PR</strong> and <strong>QRS interval duration</strong> are also different (<em>shorter</em>) in the <em>smaller</em> pediatric heart (<em>Section 04.3</em>).</li><li>Similarly —*** “Escape”***** rate ranges** differ in children. Whereas the normal <strong>AV nodal</strong> <em><strong>escape</strong></em>** rate** in an <strong>adult</strong> is <em><strong>between</strong></em> <strong>40-to-60/minute</strong> — it is <em>between</em> 50-80/minute in a young child. Therefore, the <strong>AV nodal rhythm</strong> at <strong>75/minute</strong> seen below in <strong>Figure 02.6-1</strong> would be slightly <em>fast</em> IF the patient was an adult — but is clearly <em>within</em> the normal AV nodal escape rate range IF the patient is a child (<em>See also Sections 02.32-to-02.34 on AV nodal rhythms</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.6-1:</strong>* *AV nodal rhythm at 75/minute (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>02.7 –</strong> <em><strong>Sinus Arrhythmia</strong></em></p><p>Sinus Arrhythmia is a <strong>common</strong> <em><strong>normal</strong></em>** variant** in infants and young children. At times, variability in sinus rate may be marked — in which case one might initially think <em>some other</em> arrhythmia is present.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Sinus</strong></em> <strong>Arrhythmia</strong> — is confirmed by the finding of <em>identical-appearing</em> P waves that are <em>upright</em> in lead II with <em>fixed</em> PR interval (<strong>Figure 02.7-1</strong>). In contrast — <em>other</em> phenomena (<em>wandering atrial pacemaker; sinus rhythm with PACs</em>) will manifest changes in P wave morphology <em>and/or</em> in the PR interval. <em>The P waves will be different!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.7-1:</strong>* *Sinus Arrhythmia. Despite <em>irregularity</em> in the rhythm — sinus mechanism is present as defined by regularly-occurring <em>upright</em> P waves with <em>fixed</em> PR interval preceding <em>each</em> QRS complex in this lead II rhythm strip (<em>See text</em>).</p><ul><li>Sinus arrhythmia often exhibits <em><strong>respiratory</strong></em>** variation**. This is especially true in healthy young children — for whom some variation in sinus regularity is the norm rather than the exception. Sinus “arrhythmia” is a <em>normal</em> cardiac rhythm in this setting.</li><li>Some degree of sinus variability (ie, <em>sinus arrhythmia</em>) may persist in young <em>and even</em> older adults. This is <em>not</em> necessarily abnormal. <em>Clinical correlation is key</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The <em><strong>technical</strong></em> <strong>definition</strong> of <strong>sinus</strong> <em><strong>“arrhythmia”</strong></em> — is that <em>sinus-initiated</em> R-R intervals <strong>vary</strong> by <em><strong>at least</strong></em> <strong>0.08-0.12 second</strong> (<em>2-3 little boxes</em>). This definition is clearly satisfied in Figure 02.7-1. That said, most of the time — the presence of sinus “arrhythmia” (<em>vs sinus rhythm</em>) is of <em>little-to-no clinical</em> significance.</p><ul><li>An <em><strong>exception</strong></em> to the statement that sinus arrhythmia is benign occurs in <em>older</em> patients with <strong>SSS</strong> (<em>Sick Sinus Syndrome</em>). Among the many manifestations of SSS (<em>which include sinus pauses, sinus arrest, tachy- as well as bradyarrhythmias</em>) — <strong>sinus bradycardia</strong> <em><strong>with</strong></em>** sinus arrhythmia** is the most common. The usual course of SSS is prolonged over years (<em>if not decades</em>). Many patients who go on to develop full-fledged symptoms (<em>with need for a permanent pacemaker</em>) manifest <em>no more</em> than sinus bradycardia/sinus arrhythmia for a period of many years. Therefore — the finding of an <em>inappropriately</em> slow and <em>variable</em> sinus rhythm in an older patient with symptoms of fatigue, worsening heart failure <em>and/or</em> syncope/presyncope is cause for potential concern. IF not due to rate-slowing drugs, ischemia or hypothyroidism — <em>Consider SSS</em> as the probable cause.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.8 – FIGURE 02.8-1:</strong> <em><strong>What Happens to the P in Lead II?</strong></em></p><p>Although specifics of the rhythm diagnosis in Figure 02.8-1 are advanced — the concept of routinely <em><strong>seeking</strong></em> <strong>out</strong> a <em><strong>long</strong></em>** lead II** rhythm strip <em>each</em> time you interpret a 12-lead ECG is fundamental! <em>Always begin with this step.</em></p><p><strong>Figure 02.8-1:</strong>* What happens* to the P wave in this lead II rhythm strip? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.8-1:</strong> Use the <strong>Ps, Qs & 3R Approach</strong> to assess the rhythm. As noted Section 02.1 — it does <em>not</em> matter in what <em>sequence</em> you look at the 5 parameters (<em>as long as you check them all each time you assess an ECG</em>):</p><ul><li>The overall rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 is <em>not</em> regular.</li><li>The QRS complex is narrow.</li><li>Each QRS is preceded by a P wave — BUT the <em>shape</em> of these P waves is <em>not</em> the same. The rhythm begins with a taller <em>peaked</em> P wave with fixed PR interval preceding beats #1,2,3; and #7,8. A 2nd P wave shape (<em>of smaller amplitude and notched</em>) — is then seen to precede beats #4,5,6. Thus, the <em><strong>underlying</strong></em> <strong>rhythm</strong> in Figure 02.8-1 is <strong>sinus</strong> <em><strong>arrhythmia</strong></em> — with <em>transient</em> change to <em>another</em> atrial focus for beats #4,5,6 — followed by <em>resumption</em> of the original sinus focus at the end of the tracing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><strong>Key</strong></em>** Points about Figure 02.8-1:** In our experience — the most common error in 12-lead ECG interpretation is <em>failure</em> to recognize when normal sinus rhythm is <em>not</em> present. The solution is easy:</p><ul><li>Ideally — there will be a <em>simultaneously</em> recorded <em><strong>long</strong></em>** lead II** rhythm strip. IF so — <em>Begin</em> by:** i)** assessing IF the rhythm is regular; and <strong>ii)</strong> Looking to see IF P wave morphology <em>stays the same</em> throughout the rhythm strip.</li><li>It suffices to recognize that the <em>underlying</em> rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 is sinus with a <em>change</em> in P wave morphology. It is <em>easy</em> to see this as long as you <em>consciously</em> look at P wave shape before <em>each</em> QRS.</li><li>It is clearly more difficult <em>without</em> a long lead rhythm strip. How would you* assess the rhythm* in <strong>Figure 02.9-1</strong>?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.9 – FIGURE 02.9-1:</strong> <em><strong>When there is NO long Lead II Rhythm Strip …</strong></em></p><p>The reality is — that you will <em>not</em> always have access to a long lead rhythm strip. This was the case for the 12-lead ECG previously shown in Figure 01.3-1 (<em>Section 01.3</em>). We reproduce that 12-lead tracing below in <strong>Figure 02.9-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>How would you assess the rhythm in Figure 02.9-1?</li><li><strong>How many</strong> <em><strong>total</strong></em>** beats** are there on this 12-lead ECG?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.9-1:</strong>* *12-lead ECG previously shown in Figure 01.3-1. How many <em>total beats</em> are there on this tracing? What is the rhythm? Unfortunately — there is no long lead II rhythm strip (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.9-1:</strong> The problem is that <em>only</em> 3 beats are seen in lead II of this ECG (<em>arrows</em>) before the leads switch to <em>simultaneous</em> recording of leads aVR/aVL/aVF. In addition — the R-R interval for these 3 beats that are seen in lead II is <em>not</em> the same (ie, <em>the R-R interval between beats #1-2 is longer than the R-R between beats #2-3</em>). That said, we can still diagnose the <em><strong>mechanism</strong></em> as <strong>sinus</strong> — because a <em>similarly-shaped</em> upright P wave with <em>fixed</em> PR interval precedes <em>each</em> of these 3 beats in lead II (<em>red arrows in</em> Figure 02.9-1).</p><ul><li>There are <strong>9</strong> <em><strong>total</strong></em>** beats** on this tracing. With <em>simultaneous</em> 3-channel recordings — we get “3 looks” at each beat (<em>vertical time line in leads I – II – III</em> ). The QRS is narrow. Note <em>irregularity</em> of the R-R interval for beats #1-<em>thru</em>-9. Thus — the rhythm is <em><strong>sinus</strong></em> <strong>arrhythmia</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.10 –</strong> ***Advanced ***<strong>POINT:</strong> <em><strong>What is a Wandering Pacemaker?</strong></em></p><p>Occasionally — the site of the atrial pacemaker may shift (<em>wander</em>) away from its usual site of origin in the SA (<em>Sino-Atrial</em>) Node. In most cases — <em><strong>wandering</strong></em>** atrial pacemaker** is a benign normal variant that occurs in patients <em>without</em> underlying heart disease. It may result from <em>variations</em> in <em>vagal</em> tone (<em>that slow SA nodal discharge and allow other atrial sites to temporarily emerge</em>) — or there may be no obvious cause (<strong>Figure 02.10-1</strong>).</p><ul><li><strong>ECG</strong> <em><strong>recognition</strong></em> of wandering pacer requires a <em>long enough</em> rhythm strip to appreciate <em><strong>gradual</strong></em> <strong>change</strong> over a period of beats from one P wave morphology to another. While possible that the rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 could reflect a wandering pacemaker — this rhythm strip is simply <em>not long enough</em> to tell.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.10-1:</strong>* *Wandering pacemaker. Initially the P wave in lead II is an upright sinus complex (<em>1st red arrow preceding beat #4</em>) — with <em><strong>gradual</strong></em> <strong>change</strong> to an isoelectric P wave (<em>1st blue arrow preceding beat #5</em>) — followed by resumption of sinus rhythm with beat #17 (<em>2nd red arrow in bottom rhythm strip</em>). It would be <em>easy-to-overlook</em> the diagnosis of wandering pacer IF one did not pay <em>careful</em> attention to P wave morphology!</p><p><em><strong>Bottom Line:</strong></em> True <em><strong>wandering</strong></em>** atrial pacemaker** is <em>not</em> a common diagnosis. As noted — it is difficult to recognize because most 12-lead ECGs (<em>even if accompanied by a simultaneous lead II rhythm strip</em>) will simply <em>not</em> be long enough to manifest gradual transition <em>back-and-forth</em> between SA node and two or more additional atrial sites. The point to emphasize for interpreters of <em>any</em> experience level — is the need to <em>always</em> <strong>look</strong> <em><strong>carefully</strong></em> at <strong>lead II</strong> when assessing for <em><strong>atrial</strong></em> <strong>activity</strong>:</p><ul><li>Is an <em>upright</em> sinus P wave present in lead II?</li><li>Does P wave morphology <em>change</em> during the rhythm?</li><li>Is the underlying rhythm regular?

These include: <strong>i)</strong> the SA Node; <strong>ii)</strong> from <em>somewhere</em> in the atria; or <strong>iii)</strong> the AV node. Awareness of this clinical reality greatly facilitates arrhythmia diagnosis <em>because</em> once you establish that the <strong>QRS</strong> complex in an adult is <em><strong>truly</strong></em> <strong>narrow</strong> in <em>all</em> 12 leads — you are virtually <em>assured</em> that the rhythm is supraventricular (<em>>99% of the time</em>)!</li><li>The exception (<em>occurs 0.1% of the time</em>) — in which a <em>narrow</em> QRS may arise from a <em>ventricular</em> site in an adult is IF the impulse originates from the His, fascicles or bundle branches.</li><li>The above generality does <em>not</em> hold true in children (<em>the QRS is normally narrower in the smaller pediatric heart</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.12-1:</strong>* *IF the QRS is <em>truly</em> narrow in <em>all</em> 12 leads — then for practical purposes the rhythm is <em><strong>supraventricular</strong></em> (<em>and therefore originates from <em>at</em> or <em>above</em> the double dotted red line in this Figure</em>). <strong>NOTE:</strong> The opposite is <em>not</em> true.

Undulations in the baseline (<em>known as</em> <em><strong>“fib” waves</strong></em>) may sometimes be seen. Such “fib waves” are <em>coarse</em> in <strong>Tracing B</strong> of Fig. 02.14-1 — <em>fine</em> in <strong>Tracing C</strong> — and are <em>barely detectable</em> in <strong>Tracing A</strong>.</p><ul><li>As might be imagined — the diagnosis of AFib is clearly more difficult when “fib waves” are of minimal amplitude (<em>in which case diagnosis is based solely on recognizing an irregularly irregular rhythm in the absence of P waves</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.14-1:</strong> Atrial fibrillation (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em>KEY Clinical Point:</em> Far better than simply saying the rhythm is “AFib” — is to <em><strong>clarify</strong></em> the <strong><em>ventricular</em> response</strong>. Thus, AFib will conduct with <em>either</em> a rapid, controlled, or <em>slow</em> ventricular response:</p><ul><li><strong>AFib <em>with</em></strong> a <strong><em>rapid</em> ventricular response</strong> is present — IF the <em>average</em> rate is <em>over</em> ~120/minute (<strong>Tracing A</strong> in Fig. 02.14-1). <em>New-onset</em> AFib is most often rapid (<em>unless slowed by drugs, ischemia/infarction <em>or</em> sick sinus syndrome</em>).</li><li><strong>AFib <em>with</em></strong> a <strong><em>controlled</em> ventricular response</strong> is present — IF the <em>average</em> rate of AFib is <em>between</em> ~70-110/minute (<strong>Tracing B</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 02.14-1). An important goal of medical treatment is to <em>attain</em> rate control.</li><li><strong>AFib <em>with</em></strong> a <strong><em>slow</em> ventricular response</strong> is present — IF the <em>average</em> rate is <em>less</em> than 50-60/minute (<strong>Tracing C</strong>). New-onset <em>slow</em> AFib is unusual — and should suggest a different set of diagnostic consideration (<em>rate-slowing drugs; hypothyroidism; ischemia/infarction; sick sinus</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> PEARL:</strong> When AFib is rapid — the irregularity in the rhythm may be subtle. As a result — <em>rapid</em> AFib may sometimes <em>simulate</em> PSVT. We see this toward the end of <strong>Tracing A</strong> (<em>in</em> Fig. 02.14-1).</p><ul><li><strong>Calipers</strong> may be needed to verify that the rhythm is in fact irregular <em>throughout</em> the tracing.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**02.15 – <em>Advanced <em>POINT: <em>Very</em> Fast AFib — <em>Think WPW!</em></em></em></p><p>The usual rate range for **<em>“rapid” <em>A Fib</em></em> is <strong><em>between</em> ~110-180/minute</strong>. IF ever the rate of A Fib is significantly <em>above</em> this (ie, <em>>200-220/minute</em>) — the patient probably has an AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>) that is *bypassing *the AV node (ie, <strong>WPW</strong> = <em>Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome</em>).</p><ul><li>The intrinsic <em>refractory period</em> of the normal AV node generally does <em>not</em> allow conduction of more than 200-220 impulses per minute.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.15-1:</strong> The QRS complex is wide. <strong>AFib</strong> is diagnosed by the <em>irregular</em> irregularity in the <em>absence</em> of P waves. The rate attains 250-300/minute in parts of the tracing. This is virtually diagnostic of <strong>WPW</strong> (<em>See Section 05.49</em>).</p><p><strong>02.16 – <em>Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia</em></strong></p><p>AFib should be distinguished from ***MAT *<strong>(<em>Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia</em>)</strong> **<em>—</em> in which the rhythm is also <em>irregularly</em> irregular, but in which <em>definite</em> P waves <em>are</em> present (<em>arrows in <em><strong>Figure 02.16-1</strong>). Note that P wave morphology changes from <em>beat-to-beat</em> with MAT <em>—</em> which is what distinguishes MAT from wandering atrial pacemaker (<em>See <em>Figure 02.10-1). The name <em>tells all</em> about its ECG appearance: <em><strong>M</strong></em></em>ultiple</em> <strong>A</strong>trial foci (<em>P waves</em>) are seen at a <em>fast</em> rate (ie, <em><strong>T</strong></em></em>achycardia</em>).</p><ul><li>In our experience <em>—</em> <strong>MAT</strong> is the 2nd most commonly overlooked arrhythmia diagnosis (<em>next to AFlutter</em>).

The QRS complex is narrow. The rhythm in Fig. 02.17-1 is <em>not</em> AFib — because P waves <em>are</em> clearly seen in lead II. P waves are also seen in leads III and aVF — but <em>not</em> in other leads.</p><ul><li><strong>P wave morphology</strong> in lead II <em><strong>changes</strong></em> from beat to beat. This observation <em>plus</em> knowing this patient has <strong>COPD</strong> helps to <em>solidify</em> the ECG rhythm diagnosis of <strong>MAT</strong>.</li><li><em>Additional</em> support of the diagnosis of MAT is forthcoming from recognition of several <strong>ECG findings</strong> that suggest <strong><em>significant</em> pulmonary disease</strong>. These include: <strong>i)</strong> Schamroth’s sign (<em>very low QRST amplitude in lead I</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> tall <em>pointed</em> P waves in lead II among the P wave morphologies seen; and <strong>iii)</strong> persistence of precordial S waves through to V5,V6 (<em>See Section 08.33</em>).</li><li>The clinical importance of recognizing MAT (<em>and distinguishing it from AFib</em>) — is that treatment of these two entities is different!*** Treatment of* MAT** — is <em>best</em> directed at correcting the <em>underlying</em> cause (<em>optimizing oxygenation in this case</em>). In contrast — Treatment of <strong>AFib</strong> focuses on rate control; converting the rhythm; and anticoagulation considerations.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>KEY Clinical</em> Point:</strong> Rather than a discrete entity — think of MAT as <em><strong>part</strong></em> of a <strong>spectrum</strong>. At one end — is sinus rhythm with <em>occasional</em> PACs (<strong>Tracing B</strong> in Figure 02.11-1). At the other — is MAT in which P wave morphology (<em>and the PR interval</em>) change from <em>beat-to-beat</em>. Along the way you may see sinus rhythm with <em>multiple</em> PACs (<em>but not quite enough beat-to-beat change to diagnose “MAT”</em>).</p><ul><li>Clinically — implications of the various arrhythmias that may be seen <em>throughout</em> this spectrum are similar. These are to diagnose and treat the underlying disorder as first priority (<em>usually hypoxemia from pulmonary disease; electrolyte or acid-base disturbance; other metabolic problems</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.18 – <em>Atrial Flutter</em></strong></p><p>AFlutter (<em>Atrial Flutter</em>) — is characterized by a special pattern of <em>regular</em> atrial activity that in adults *almost *always (<em>and almost magically</em>) occurs at a rate of <strong>300/minute</strong> (<em>250-350/minute = usual range</em>). Atrial flutter typically manifests a <em><strong>sawtooth</strong></em> appearance that is usually best seen in the <em>inferior</em> leads — although at times, flutter waves may be subtle and only seen in a few leads (Figure 02.18-1).</p><ul><li>The <strong><em>most</em> common</strong> <em>ventricular</em> response to atrial flutter (<em>by far!</em>) is with <strong>2:1 AV conduction</strong>. As a result, the ventricular rate with <em><strong>untreated</strong></em> atrial flutter will usually be <em>close</em> to <strong>150/minute</strong> (ie, <em>~300 ÷ 2</em>). <strong>NOTE:</strong> The atrial rate <em>may slower</em> IF antiarrhythmic drugs are used.</li><li>Less commonly with AFlutter there is <strong>4:1</strong> AV conduction (<em>ventricular rate ~75/minute</em>) — or a <em><strong>variable</strong></em> (= <em>irregular</em>)** ventricular response**.</li><li>**<em>Odd <em>ratios</em></em> (ie, <em>1:1, 3:1, 5:1</em>) are possible but <strong><em>extremely</em> uncommon</strong> (<em>unless the patient has WPW <em>or</em> is already on antiarrhythmic drugs</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.18-1:</strong> Atrial Flutter with 2:1 AV conduction (<strong>Tracing A</strong>). Note how much easier it is to identify AFlutter when the AV conduction ratio is slower (<em>as it is with 4:1 AV conduction in</em> <strong>Tracing B</strong>). Tracing B shows the effect that a <strong><em>vagal</em> maneuver</strong> might have (<em>See Sections 02.26, 02.27</em>).</p><p><strong>02.19 – FIGURE 02.19-1: <em>Easy to Overlook AFlutter …</em></strong></p><p>In our experience — <strong>AFlutter</strong> is by far the <strong>most commonly <em>overlooked</em> rhythm diagnosis</strong>.

Atrial activity is usually <em>not</em> evident — although subtle notching or a negative deflection (<em>representing retrograde atrial activity</em>) may sometimes be seen at the tail end of the QRS.</p><p><strong>Figure 02.29-1:</strong> PSVT (<em>regular SVT without sinus P waves at ~200/minute</em>). Rate is calculated by the <em>every-other-beat</em> method (<em>See Section 02.31</em>).</p><p>Mechanistically — <strong>PSVT</strong> is a <strong><em>reentry</em> tachycardia</strong> that involves at least some portion of the AV node (Figure 02.29-2). This accounts for the <em>other</em> name for this rhythm = <strong>AVNRT</strong> (<em><strong>AV N</strong></em><em>odal <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>eentry <strong><strong>T</strong></strong>achycardia</em>).</p><ul><li>PSVT is often initiated by a PAC (*which arrives early at the AV Node *— <em>at a time when conditions are “just right” to allow the reentry circuit to be set up</em>). Once set up — the impulse <em>continues</em> to circulate *within *the AV Node (Figure 02-29-2) — <em>until</em> the reentry pathway is either interrupted (ie, <em>by AV nodal blocking drugs <em>or</em> a vagal maneuver</em>) — or until it stops <em>spontaneously.</em></li><li>Of note, each time the impulse circulates around the AV Node — it conducts a QRS <em>down</em> to the ventricles and also conducts <em>retrograde</em> back up to the atria (Fig. 02.29-2).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.29-2:</strong> PSVT. <em>Schematic</em> illustration of <em>reentry</em> involving a portion of the AV Node.

As opposed to NSR (<em>Normal Sinus Rhythm</em>) — in which conduction begins in the <strong>SA Node</strong> and travels downward (*left panel in *Figure 02.32-1) — electrical activity <em>begins</em> in the <strong>AV Node</strong> with junctional beats or rhythm (<em>right panel</em>) — and is conducted *backward *(ie, <em>retrograde</em>) or <em>away</em> from Lead II. As a result, when a <strong>P wave</strong> is seen in <strong>lead II</strong> with junctional beats or junctional rhythm — it will be <em><strong>negative</strong></em> (<em>since electrical activity is traveling away from standard lead II in its path back to the atria</em>).</p><p><strong>Fig. 02.32-1:</strong> Anatomic site of origin for <strong><em>sinus</em> rhythm</strong> (<em>left</em>) vs AV Nodal beats or <strong>AV Nodal</strong> (<em>junctional</em>) <strong>rhythm</strong> (<em>right</em>).

The QRS complex is narrow. It is <em>not</em> preceded by any P waves. Thus, this is an <strong>AV <em>Nodal</em> Rhythm</strong>, albeit one that is slightly <em><strong>accelerated</strong></em> over the <strong><em>usual</em> 40-60/minute</strong> rate expected for junctional “escape” in an <strong>adult</strong> (<em>Sections 02.32-thru-02.34</em>).</p><ul><li>The fact that no P wave at all is seen in this lead II rhythm strip is abnormal.

The patient is hemodynamically stable.</p><p><strong>Figure 02.45-1:</strong> Practice Tracing D.</p><p><strong>ANSWER to Tracing D:</strong> The rhythm is rapid and regular. The QRS appears to be narrow. We estimate heart rate by the <em>every-other-beat</em> method (<em>Section 02.31</em>). The R–R interval of <strong>every-<em><strong>other</strong></em>-beat</strong> (ie, <em>half</em> the rate) is about 3 large boxes. This means that <em>half</em> the rate is ~100/minute (<em>300/3</em>). The <strong><em>actual</em> rate</strong> is therefore <em>twice</em> this, or <strong>~200/minute</strong>. The rhythm is <strong>PSVT</strong> — since a rate of ~200/minute is <em>too fast</em> for <em>either</em> sinus tachycardia in an adult or <em>untreated</em> AFlutter (*See *List #2 — <em>Sections 02.52, 02.53</em>).</p><ul><li>Although children may manifest sinus tachycardia at rates <em>over</em> 200/minute — the <em>rapidity</em> of the rate in Fig. 02.45 virtually <em>excludes</em> sinus tachycardia in an adult.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> A useful formula to keep in mind is that <strong><em>maximal</em> heart rate = 220 — age</strong>. This formula is used prior to treadmill testing to estimate what the “target heart rate” should be during the procedure (<em>the usual goal being to attain at least 85% of maximal predicted heart rate during exercise</em>). Thus — maximal <em>estimated</em> heart rate for a healthy <strong>30-year old</strong> would be 220 — 30 = <strong>190/minute</strong>. That said — clinical sinus tachycardia in an adult (<em>who is not performing maximal exercise</em>) rarely exceeds a rate of 160-170/minute. This is <em>not</em> to say that you will never see sinus tachycardia rates faster than this — but <em>only</em> to say the odds strongly favor an etiology <em>other than</em> sinus tachycardia for a <em>regular</em> SVT >170/minute.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.46 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing E</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the lead II rhythm strip in <strong>Figure 02.46-1</strong>.

The R-R interval appears to vary <em>between</em> 2 and 3 large boxes. The QRS is narrow. Despite the irregularity — this is <em>not</em> AFib because P waves <em>are</em> present. P wave morphology <em>varies</em> from beat-to-beat. This is <strong>MAT</strong> (<em>Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia — Section 02.16</em>).</p><ul><li>It is important to distinguish MAT from AFib (<em>Section 02.17</em>). <em>Both rhythms are irregularly irregular</em>. The difference is that <em>no</em> P waves are seen on any of the leads of a 12-lead ECG with AFib. In contrast — <em>definite</em> P waves <em>are</em> seen with MAT. As opposed to wandering pacemaker, in which there is gradual transition from one P wave shape to another — with MAT, P wave variation is completely random and varies from one beat to-the-next (<em>as in</em> Fig. 02.46-1).</li><li>The <em>KEY</em> in management of MAT is to treat the <em>underlying</em> disorder.

But when there is <strong><em>extreme</em> axis deviation</strong> (<em>such that the QRS in either lead I or aVF is virtually entirely negative</em>) — then VT is almost certain!</li><li><strong>Rule #2</strong> — Is <strong>Lead V6 <em>all</em></strong> (<em>or almost all</em>)** Negative?** IF so — then VT is <em>highly</em> likely. Use of this lead V6 criterion is <em>only</em> helpful if there is <em>no more</em> than a tiny r wave in V6. If the R in V6 is ≥3mm — this <em>doesn’t</em> rule in or out VT.</li><li><strong>Rule #3</strong> — Is the <strong>QRS “Ugly”?</strong> The “uglier” the QRS complex — the <em>more</em> likely the rhythm is VT. The reason for this is that <em>aberrant</em> conduction almost always manifests some variation of a conduction defect (<em>RBBB; LBBB; LAHB; LPHB — or some combination thereof</em>). In contrast — VT originates from <em>outside</em> the conduction system (<em>and is therefore more likely to be wider and far less organized = “uglier” in its conduction pattern</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Applying</em> the 3 <em>Simple</em> Rules to Figure 02.49-1:</strong> If told that the rhythm in Figure 02.49-1 was obtained from an <em>older</em> patient <em>with</em> underlying heart disease — We’d estimate a <em><strong>~90% likelihood</strong></em> of <strong>VT</strong> based on the finding of a <em>regular</em> WCT rhythm <em>without</em> sinus P waves (<em>Section 02.47</em>). Use of the 3 <em>Simple</em> Rules allows us to <em>increase</em> the <em><strong>likelihood</strong></em> of <strong>VT</strong> to <strong><em>almost</em> 100%</strong>:</p><ul><li>There is <em>extreme</em> axis deviation in Figure 02.49-1 (<em>the QRS complex is completely negative in lead I of this tracing</em>).</li><li>Lead V6 is <em>almost entirely</em> negative (<em>at most a tiny r wave is present</em>).</li><li>The QRS in Fig. 02.49-1 is very wide (<em>almost 0.20 second</em>) and formless.

By the <strong><em>every-other-beat</em> method</strong> (<em>Section 02.31</em>) — the R-R interval of <em>half</em> the rate is 3 <em>large</em> boxes. Therefore — <em>half</em> the rate in Fig. 02.53-1 = 300/3 = 100/minute. This means that the <strong><em>actual</em> rate</strong> = 100 X 2 = <strong>200/minute</strong>.</p><ul><li>There is <em>no</em> clear sign of atrial activity in Fig. 02.53-1.

While there <em>are</em> other types of SVT rhythms (ie, <em>automatic atrial and junctional tachycardias</em>) — these are <em>far less common</em> than the 3 entities we include in List #2. <strong>NOTE:</strong> AFib is <em>not</em> a consideration in Figure 02.53-1 — because this rhythm is regular!</li><li>To distinguish between the 3 entities on List #2 — We begin by <em>looking</em> at the rate of this <em>regular</em> SVT. <strong>IF</strong> the <em><strong>rate</strong></em> of a <strong><em>regular</em> SVT is >160-170/minute</strong> — then <em>both</em> sinus tachycardia and AFlutter become <em>far less</em> likely. While <strong><em>sinus</em> tachycardia</strong> may attain rates of ≥200/minute in children — excessively fast rates are unusual in <em>nonexercising</em> adults. Therefore, the rate of ~200/minute in Fig. 02.53-1 effectively <em>rules out</em> sinus tachycardia in this case.</li><li><strong>AFlutter</strong> — most often conducts at a ventricular rate that is <strong><em>close</em> to 150/minute</strong> (<em>usual range ~140-160/min</em>).

Verify that the QRS is <em>truly</em> narrow in <em>all</em> leads.

It will convert <em>most</em> PSVT — and, it usually produces <em>transient</em> slowing of <em>other</em> SVT rhythms which may be diagnostic (Figure 02.28-1).</li><li>*Consider *other AV-blocking drugs (<em>β-blockers; diltiazem</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.55 – FIGURE 02.55-1: <em>Which SVT is present?</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the rhythm for the 12-lead ECG and Lead II rhythm strip that appears in <strong>Figure 02.55-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>What is your <em>differential</em> diagnosis?</li><li>What <strong><em>diagnostic</em> maneuver</strong> might help in diagnosis?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.55-1:</strong> <em>Regular</em> SVT at ~150/minute. <em>Diagnosis?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.55-1:</strong> The rhythm is <em>regular</em> at a <em>ventricular</em> rate that is <em>close</em> to 150/minute (*the R-R interval is ~2 large boxes in duration *— <em>and 300/2 = 150/min</em>). The QRS complex is narrow (ie, <em>not more than half a large box</em>). Normal atrial activity is absent — since <em>upright</em> P waves are <em>not</em> seen in lead II. Instead, there is suggestion of atrial activity having a <em>negative</em> deflection in lead II (<em>as well as in other inferior leads</em>). There also appears to be a negative <em>notching</em> in the ST segment in each of the inferior leads. <em>Could this all represent atrial activity?</em></p><ul><li>The answer is forthcoming with application of a **<em>vagal <em>maneuver</em></em>.

This is because <em>right-sided</em> lead V1 lies anatomically in close proximity to the atria. Note that a flutter <em>sawtooth</em> pattern is suggested in lead V1 on the 12-lead tracing in Figure 02.55-1.</p><ul><li>In retrospect — atrial activity <em>was</em> suggested in <em>several</em> leads in Fig. 02.55-1 (<em>II,III,aVF;aVR,aVL,V1,V2,V5</em>) — but it was <em>not</em> seen in all leads. CSM <em>confirmed</em> the diagnosis.</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> The best way to <em>avoid</em> overlooking the diagnosis of AFlutter — is to <strong><em>suspect</em> AFlutter</strong> <em>until</em> proven otherwise <em>whenever</em> confronted with a <em>regular</em> SVT at a rate <em>close</em> to 150/minute but <em>without</em> definite sinus P waves (<em>Section 02.19</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.56 – <em>Premature</em> Beats</strong></p><p><strong><em>Premature</em> Beats</strong> — are QRS complexes that interrupt the underlying rhythm by occurring <em><strong>earlier</strong></em> than expected. They are <strong>3 <em>basic</em> types</strong> of <strong><em>early</em> beats</strong> (Figure 02.56-1):</p><ul><li><strong>PACs (P</strong>remature <em><strong>A</strong></em><em>trial</em> <strong>C</strong>ontractions**)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from somewhere in the atria <em>other than</em> the SA node. As a result — the <em>early-occurring</em> P wave manifests a <em>different</em> shape (<em><strong>beat #4</strong></em>* in* <strong>Fig. 02.56-1</strong>). Most often the impulse is conducted with a <em>narrow</em> QRS complex that is <em>identical</em> in appearance to that of normal <em>sinus-conducted</em> beats. This is because once the premature atrial impulse arrives at the AV Node — its path of conduction through the AV Node and down to the ventricles is the <em>same</em> as it is for normally conducted sinus beats.</li><li><strong>PJCs (P</strong>remature <em><strong>J</strong></em><em>unctional</em> <strong>C</strong>ontractions**)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from the AV Node. Most often the impulse is conducted with a <em>narrow</em> QRS that is similar (<em>if not identical</em>) to normal sinus-conducted beats. The P wave in lead II is <em>negative</em> or absent (***beat #6 ****in *Fig. 02.56-1; <em>See also Sections 02.32-thru-02.35</em>). Clinically — PJCs are much <em>less</em> common than PACs.</li><li><strong>PVCs (P</strong>remature <em><strong>V</strong></em><em>entricular</em> <strong>C</strong>ontractions**)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from the <em>ventricles</em>. PVCs are <em>wide</em> and have a <em>very</em> different appearance from sinus beats. PVCs are <em>not</em> preceded by a premature P wave (<em><strong>beat #8</strong></em>* below*). The reason <strong>PVCs</strong> are <em><strong>wide</strong></em> — is that the premature impulse arises from a site within the ventricles <em>away</em> from the conduction system. It therefore takes <em>more time</em> for the premature impulse to be conducted through the ventricles.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.56-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm with <em>premature</em> beats. These differ from <em>“escape beats”</em> that occur late (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Although <strong>beat #6</strong> in Figure 02.56-1 is labeled as a “PJC” <em>—</em> it could be a <em>low atrial</em> PAC instead. There is <em>NO way</em> to know for certain (<em>Section 02.35</em>). Management is the same <em>—</em> so clinically, it really does <em>not</em> matter whether beat #6 is a PJC vs a PAC arising from a low atrial site (<em>PACs are much more common than PJCs</em>.)</p><ul><li><strong>PEARL</strong> <em>—</em> <em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Although the QRS complex of <em>junctional</em> beats is <em>usually</em> the same as the QRS of sinus-conducted beats — this is <em>not</em> always the case. At times — there may be <em>slight</em> variation in QRS morphology for <em>early-occurring</em> beats arising from the AV Node. This is because junctional beats may arise from <em>different</em> locations <em>within</em> the AV Node — which may result in a slightly different path of conduction. Thus, the QRS complex will still be narrow — but the R wave may be a little taller or shorter; or the S wave a little bigger or smaller. This is an <em>advanced</em> concept — but it may assist in evaluating occasional complex AV block tracings when it becomes important to determine IF certain beats are being conducted vs representing AV nodal escape.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.57 – <em>ESCAPE</em> Beats: <em>Timing is Everything …</em></strong></p><p>It is important to distinguish between <strong>early</strong> (<em>premature</em>) <strong>beats</strong> vs <strong><em>late</em> beats</strong>. Early beats (<em>PACs, PJCs, PVCs</em>) may be problematic — especially if they precipitate runs of tachycardia (<strong>Tracing A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 02.57-1). In contrast — <em>late</em> beats often reflect an “escape” phenomenon which may be beneficial. Were it not for emergence of <em>ventricular</em> beats #5, 6 in <strong>Tracing B</strong> (<em>Fig. 02.57-1</em>) — the short pause (<em>between beats #4-5</em>) may have been much longer.</p><ul><li><em>Unless</em> accelerated — the <strong><em>usual</em> rate</strong> of <strong><em>ventricular</em> escape</strong> is <strong><em>between</em> 20-40/minute</strong> (<em>AIVR was covered in Section 02.38; Escape Rhythms in Section 02.40</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.57-1:</strong> In <strong>Tracing A</strong> — an <em>early</em> beat (<em>PVC</em>) precipitates a run of VT after beat #3. In contrast —** beat #5** in <strong>Tracing B</strong> is <em>not</em> a “PVC”, because this beat is <em>not</em> premature. Instead — beat #5 in Tracing B occurs relatively <em>“late”</em>, and therefore reflects <strong><em>ventricular</em> escape</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><em>02.58 –</em> Narrow-Complex <em>Escape Beats</em></em></p><p>As highlighted by Figure 02.57-1 — <em><strong>timing</strong></em> is the <em>key</em> parameter for distinguishing between <em>premature</em> vs <em>escape</em> beats.

Is the P wave that <em>just precedes</em> beat #5 in Tracing B conducting? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.58-1:</strong> The <em>underlying</em> rhythm in Figure 02.58-1 is sinus — as determined by the presence of regular upright P waves preceding each of the first 4 beats with a constant (<em>and normal</em>) PR interval.</p><ul><li><strong>Beat #5</strong> in <em>both</em> <strong>Tracing A</strong> and <strong>Tracing B</strong> of Figure 02.58-1 is <strong>late</strong>. As a result (<em>by definition</em>) — beat #5 can <em>not</em> be either a “PAC” or “PJC”, since it is <em>not</em> “premature”.</li><li>Instead — beat #5 is an <strong><em>“escape”</em> beat</strong>. The occurrence of beat #5 for each tracing in Figure 02.58-1 is a <em>good</em> thing! Sinus conduction <em>fails</em> after beat #4. If not for the escape beat (<em>beat #5</em>) — the pause in <em>each</em> case may have been <em>much</em> longer…</li></ul><p> </p><p>Focusing first on** Tracing A** in <strong>Figure 02.58-1</strong>: The QRS complex of beat #5 is narrow. It is <em>not</em> preceded by any P wave. As a result — we <em>know</em> this escape beat <em>must be</em> arising from <em><strong>within</strong></em> the <strong>conduction system</strong>. Possibilities include the AV Node, Bundle of His, or from one of the major fascicles of the bundle branch system. Practically speaking — precise location of the escape site does <em>not</em> matter since initial clinical management will be the same <em>regardless</em> of the site of the escape beat.</p><ul><li>Sinus rhythm resumes in Tracing A after <em>slight</em> delay with <strong>beat #6</strong>.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> QRS morphology of escape beat #5 is similar but <em>not quite</em> identical to QRS morphology of normal sinus beats (<em>beat #5 is slightly taller than sinus beats <em>—</em> and it has a small narrow s wave that sinus beats don’t</em>). As alluded to in the <em>PEARL</em> in <em>Section 02.56</em> — recognition of this <em>slight</em> difference in QRS morphology for beat #5 (<em>compared to the QRS of normal sinus beats</em>) — provides support that <em>narrow-complex</em> beat #5 is arising from a supraventricular site <em>other than</em> the SA node.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Looking next at** Tracing B** in <strong>Figure 02.58-1</strong>: The QRS complex of beat #5 is again narrow. This time beat #5 is preceded by a P wave — albeit the PR interval <em>preceding</em> the QRS of beat #5 in Tracing B is far <strong><em>too short</em> to conduct</strong>.</p><ul><li>The P wave preceding beat #5 in Tracing B is <em>not</em> a “PAC” — because this P wave is not premature.</li><li>We surmise instead that a brief <strong><em>sinus</em> pause</strong> (<em>of 7 large boxes =1.4 seconds</em>) ensues after beat #4. The sinus node finally recovers — but <em>before</em> the P wave preceding beat #5 in Tracing B is able to conduct to the ventricles, an <strong><em>escape</em> beat</strong> occurs.</li><li>That the <strong>QRS</strong> complex of escape beat #5 in Tracing B is <em><strong>narrow</strong></em> tells us the escape focus <em>must be</em> arising from a site <strong><em>within</em> the ventricular conduction system</strong>. Possibilities again include the AV Node, Bundle of His, or one of the major fascicles of the bundle branch system.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The R-R interval preceding escape beat #5 in Tracing B is 7 large boxes. This corresponds to an <strong><em>escape</em> rate</strong> of <strong>~43/minute</strong> (300/7).

What counts — is that recognition of <strong><em>late</em> beats</strong> with a <strong><em>narrow</em> QRS</strong> (<em>as occurs in each tracing of Fig. 02.58-1</em>) — indicates an <strong><em>escape</em> site</strong> from <em>somewhere</em> within the <strong><em>ventricular</em> conduction system</strong>.</p><p>**02.59 – PVC Definitions: *Repetitive Forms and Runs of VT ***</p><p>Clinically — the occurrence of <strong><em>repetitive</em> PVCs</strong> (<em>2 or more in a row</em>) — is of much more concern than <strong><em>isolated</em> PVCs</strong>. In addition to clinical assessment of the patient (ie, <em>for underlying heart disease; associated medical conditions; electrolyte imbalance; hypoxemia; etc</em>.) — one aims to assess the <em>relative</em> frequency of PVCs — QRS morphology (<em>uniform or multiform</em>) — coupling interval — <em>plus</em> the rate and duration of any runs (<strong>Figure 02.59-1</strong>):</p><ul><li><strong>Tracing A:</strong> Following 3 <em>sinus</em> beats — an <strong><em>isolated</em> PVC</strong> occurs (<em>beat #4</em>). Beats #7,8 — represent a <strong><em>ventricular</em> couplet</strong>. Note that the <em>coupling</em> interval (<em>distance between beat #6 and beat #7</em>) and QRS morphology of this couplet are the <em>same</em> as was seen for the <em>isolated</em> PVC (<em>beat #4</em>). <strong>Beat #10</strong> — is another PVC. Since its shape is <em>different</em>, we say there are <strong><em>multiform</em> PVCs</strong> in Tracing A.</li><li><strong>Tracing B:</strong> 3 <em>sinus</em> beats — then a <strong><em>ventricular</em> salvo</strong> (<em>beats #4,5,6</em>). Since the <em><strong>definition</strong></em> of <strong>“VT”</strong> is ≥3 PVCs in a row — this is a 3-beat run of VT. <strong>Beat #9</strong> begins a <strong><em>longer</em> run</strong> of <strong>VT</strong>. In fact — we have <em>no idea</em> of how long this run will last — since <strong>Tracing B</strong> in Figure 02.59-1 is cut off after beat #13. We describe beats #9-<em>thru</em>-13 as a <strong>5-beat run</strong> of <strong><em>monomorphic</em> VT</strong> at a <em><strong>rate</strong></em> of <strong>~150/minute</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.59-1:</strong> Various forms of ventricular ectopy (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><em>02.60 –</em> Blocked</em> PACs/<em>Aberrant</em> Conduction**</p><p>Although <em>most</em> premature <em>supraventricular</em> beats (<em>PACs or PJCs</em>) are conducted to the ventricles <em>normally</em> (ie, <em>with a narrow QRS</em>) — this is *not *always the case. Instead, PACs (<em>or PJCs</em>) may sometimes occur so early in the cycle as to be <em><strong>&ldquo;blocked&rdquo;</strong></em> (<em>non-conducted</em>) — because the conduction system is still in the <strong>ARP</strong> (<em>Absolute Refractory Period</em> = <em>2nd arrow in</em> <strong>Figure 02.60-1</strong>).</p><ul><li>At other times — <em>early</em> beats may occur during the <strong>RRP</strong> (<em>Relative Refractory Period</em>) — in which case <strong><em>aberrant</em> conduction</strong> (<em>with a widened QRS</em>) occurs (<em>3rd arrow</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.60-1:</strong> <em>Blocked</em> vs <em>aberrantly</em> conducted PACs.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Whether a PAC will be <em>blocked</em> vs conducted normally — or with <em>aberrancy</em> depends on <em>where</em> in the cycle the PAC occurs (<strong>Figure 02.60-2</strong>). A PAC occurring at point <strong>X</strong> in Fig. 02.60-2 will be blocked (<em>corresponding to the PAC notching the T wave of beat #5 in Fig. 02.60-1</em>). In contrast — a PAC that occurs <em>after</em> the RRP is over (<em>point <strong><strong>Z</strong></strong> in</em> Fig. 02.60-2) will be conducted normally (<em>corresponding to beat #4 in Fig. 02.60-1</em>). It is when the PAC occurs <em>within</em> the RRP that <em>aberrant</em> conduction is seen (<em>corresponding to point <strong><strong>Y</strong></strong> in</em> Fig. 02.60-2 = <em>beat #7 in Fig. 02.60-1</em>).</p><p><strong>Figure 02.60-2:</strong> Whether a PAC (<em>or PJC</em>) will be blocked — conducted normally — or conducted with aberrancy — will depend on <em>where</em> in the cycle the beat occurs (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>PEARL:</strong> The <em>best</em> way to diagnose PACs with <strong><em>aberrant</em> conduction</strong> is when the abnormal beat is clearly <em>preceded</em> by a PAC (<em><strong>beat #7</strong></em>* in <em>Fig. 02.60-1).

The <em>KEY</em> is to recognize <em>blocked</em> PACs (<em>and not misdiagnose the pause as a type of AV block</em>).

RBBB aberration is the most common form — because the right bundle branch generally has a <em>longer</em> refractory period than other conduction fascicles. That said — <em>any</em> BBB/hemiblock pattern of aberrancy may be seen (<em>RBBB; LBBB; isolated LAHB or LPHB; RBBB/LAHB; or RBBB/LPHB</em>).

However, <em>no P waves</em> are seen in this Lead II. Thus, the rhythm is <em>not</em> sinus. In the <em>absence</em> of P waves — QRS widening suggests a <strong><em>ventricular</em> site</strong> of origin. Because the rate is <em>faster</em> than usual for a ventricular escape rhythm — this is <strong>AIVR</strong> (<em>Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm</em> — <em>Section 02.38</em>).</p><ul><li>The <em>clinical</em> setting is key for determining the approach to AIVR. This rhythm is often surprisingly benign when it occurs in the setting of <em>acute</em> MI in a <em>hemodynamically</em> stable patient.

In contrast — prognostic implications are much poorer when AIVR is seen during the course of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.64 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing H</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the lead II rhythm strip in <strong>Figure 02.64-1</strong>.

Beat #4 occurs early. It is wide, very <em>different</em> in morphology from <em>sinus-conducted</em> beats, and is* not* preceded by a premature P wave. <strong>Beat #4</strong> is a <strong>PVC</strong>.

It is difficult to determine IF this is due to underlying <em>sinus</em> arrhythmia vs some component of sinus node suppression from the <em>early-occuring</em> beats. Clinically — it does <em>not</em> really matter whether sinus arrhythmia is present or not, as the primary rhythm abnormality relates to the PAC/PVCs.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.65 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing I</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the lead II rhythm strip in <strong>Figure 02.65-1</strong>. The patient is hemodynamically stable.</p><p><strong>Figure 02.65-1:</strong> Practice Tracing I.</p><p><strong>ANSWER to Tracing I:</strong> The rhythm is rapid and regular at ~180/minute. The QRS appears to be <em>narrow</em>, which makes this a <strong><em>Regular <em>SVT</em></em>. It is impossible to determine IF the upright deflection between QRS complexes is a P wave, T wave, or both. The <strong><em>differential</em> diagnosis</strong> is that of the <strong>3 entities</strong> contained in <strong>List #2</strong>. These are:</strong> i)** Sinus Tachycardia; <strong>ii)</strong> Atrial Flutter; or <strong>iii)</strong> PSVT (<em>Section 02.52</em>). The rapid rate of ~180/minute favors <strong>PSVT</strong> as the most likely diagnosis in this case.</p><ul><li>Sinus Tachycardia <em>rarely</em> exceeds a rate of 160-170/minute in a <em>non-exercising</em> adult. This is <em>not</em> to say that you can never have Sinus Tach at a rate of 180/minute in an adult — but rather to <em>strongly</em> suggest you consider <em>other</em> diagnostic possibilities as far more likely.</li><li>PSVT most commonly utilizes a <strong><em>reentry</em> mechanism</strong> involving <em>some</em> portion of the AV Node to sustain the tachycardia. As a result — application of a <strong><em>vagal</em> maneuver</strong> may be <em>both</em> diagnostic and therapeutic (<em>Sections 02.26, 02.27</em>). If vagal maneuvers are ineffective — administration of an AV nodal blocking drug (<em>Adenosine; Diltiazem; a β–Blocker</em>) stands an excellent chance of converting the rhythm.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Assuming the patient continues to tolerate the tachycardia — we favor <em><strong>obtaining</strong></em> a <strong>12-lead ECG <em>during</em> tachycardia</strong>. Doing so may provide additional clues to etiology — especially when compared to a post-conversion 12-lead tracing (ie, *the thin s-wave notch in the terminal portion of the QRS complex in Fig. 02.65-1 may represent retrograde atrial activity during this reentry tachycardia *— <em>similar to notching in the example of PSVT seen previously in</em> Figure 02.30-1).</li><li>Finally — We note <strong><em>marked</em> ST depression</strong> in Figure 02.65-1. That said — the amount of ST depression may be exaggerated by a rhythm strip. <em>Never</em> draw conclusions from ST segment deviations (<em>elevation or depression</em>) on a rhythm strip. Obtaining a <strong>12-lead ECG</strong> — and <em><strong>repeating</strong></em> the <strong>12-lead</strong> <em>after</em> the tachycardia resolves is the best way to assess likely clinical significance (<em>if any</em>) of ST depression seen during tachycardia.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.66 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing J</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the lead II rhythm strip in <strong>Figure 02.66-1</strong>.

The rhythm then degenerates to <strong>VFib</strong> (<em>Ventricular Fibrillation</em>).</p><ul><li>While List #1 <em>does</em> allow for the possibility of SVT with <em>either</em> preexisting BBB or aberrant conduction — VT should <em>always</em> be presumed until <em>proven</em> otherwise.

For example — *immediate <em>treatment is <em>not</em> necessarily needed for all patients with</em> 3rd degree AV *block!</p><ul><li>Clearly — a pacemaker is indicated for <em>symptomatic</em> bradycardia that is <em>not</em> readily reversible (<em>not due to drugs or some other treatable cause</em>).</li><li>That said, a patient with 3rd degree AV block from acute* inferior *infarction may <em>not</em> necessarily need a pacer — IF the patient is *asymptomatic *with junctional escape at <em>reasonable</em> rate and a <em>normal</em> BP (<em>because AV block in this setting may resolve on its own</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.68 – <em>Blocked</em> PACs: <em>Much More Common than AV Block</em></strong></p><p>Before describing the AV Blocks — it is well to emphasize the <em>KEY</em> clinical concept we introduced in Section 02.60: The <strong><em>commonest</em> cause</strong> of a <strong>pause</strong> is a <strong><em>blocked</em> PAC</strong>. IF looked for — <em>blocked</em> PACs will be found <em>much</em> more often than <em>any</em> type of AV block.</p><ul><li>We have already highlighted how to recognize <strong><em>blocked</em> PACs</strong> by the notching (<em>or other deformity</em>) they produce in the T wave at the onset of the pause (<em>See the T waves of beat #5 in</em> Fig. 02.60-1; <em>and of beat #7 in</em> Fig. 02.60-3).</li><li>Consider the example in <strong>Figure 02.68-1</strong>. Despite two pauses and the presence of group beating — this rhythm does <em>not</em> represent any form of AV block. <em>Do you see why not?</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.68-1:</strong> Despite 2 pauses and group beating — this rhythm does <em>not</em> represent any form of AV block. <em>Why not?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.68-1:</strong> Keeping in mind that <em>“the most common cause of a pause is a blocked PAC”</em> — we routinely look for blocked PACs <em>whenever</em> we see an unanticipated relative <em>pause</em> in the cardiac rhythm.</p><ul><li>Note that the T wave of <em>all</em> beats in Figure 02.68-1 is smooth and rounded — <em>except</em> for the T waves of the 2 beats at the <em>onset</em> of each short pause (= <em>the T waves of beats #2 and #6</em>). Instead — the T waves of beats #2 and #6 are both notched! This notching is the result of <strong><em>blocked</em> PACs</strong> that are <em>hidden</em> within these T waves (<em>arrows in</em> <strong>Figure 02.68-2</strong>).</li><li>As we will see momentarily (<em>in Section 02.72</em>) — there are <em>other</em> reasons why the rhythm in Figure 02.68-2 is <em>not</em> 2nd degree AV block of the Wenckebach type: <strong>i)</strong> the atrial rate is <em>not</em> regular; and <strong>ii)</strong> the PR interval does <em>not</em> progressively increase within groups of beats.</li><li><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Did you notice that the PR interval preceding beat #7 in Figure 02.68-1 is <em>shorter</em> than the PR interval preceding all other beats? This is because <strong>beat #7</strong> is a <strong>junctional <em>escape</em> beat</strong> that occurs <em>just before</em> the sinus P wave preceding it has a chance to conduct to the ventricles. We expand on this concept later in this chapter in our discussion on AV dissociation (<em>in Sections 02.77, 02.78</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.68-2:</strong> Sinus rhythm with <strong><em>blocked</em> PACs</strong> (<em>arrows</em>). There is <em>no</em> AV block in this tracing because: <strong>i)</strong> the P-P interval is <em>not</em> regular (<em>vertical red lines</em>); and ii) the PR interval does <em>not</em> progressively increase within groups of beats. <em>The commonest cause of a pause is a blocked PAC</em>.</p><p><strong>02.69 – The 3 Degrees of AV Block</strong></p><p>Diagnosis of the different forms of AV block need <em>not</em> be difficult. Simply stated — there are <strong>3 degrees</strong> of AV block:</p><ul><li><strong>1st degree AV Block</strong> (<em>Section 02.70</em>) — in which <em>all</em> impulses from above (ie, <em>from the SA node</em>) are conducted to the ventricles. It is just that they take <em>longer</em> than usual to get there (ie, <em>more than 0.20 second in an adult</em>).</li><li><strong>2nd degree AV Block</strong> (<em>Section 02.71</em>) — in which <em>some</em> sinus impulses get through the AV node and are conducted to the ventricles, but others do not.</li><li><strong>3rd degree</strong> or <strong><em>complete</em> AV Block</strong> (<em>Section 02.75</em>) — in which <em>no</em> sinus impulses get through.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> From a practical, clinical perspective (<em>as we describe momentarily</em>) — the diagnosis of <em>both</em> 1st degree and 3rd degree AV block is surprisingly easy!</p><ul><li>Awareness of this important concept tremendously facilitates diagnosis of the AV blocks. That is — IF an AV block is present and the block is <em>neither</em> 1st degree <em>nor</em> 3rd degree — then it must be <em>some form</em> of 2nd degree AV block.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.70 – 1st Degree AV Block</strong></p><p>First degree AV block is diagnosed by the finding of a <strong><em>prolonged</em> PR interval</strong>. This is defined as a PR interval that clearly measures <em><strong>more</strong></em> than <strong>0.20-0.21 second</strong> = clearly <em>more</em> than 1 <em>large</em> box in duration on ECG grid paper (Figure 02.70-1).</p><ul><li>Practically speaking — <strong>1st degree AV block</strong> is simply a sinus rhythm with a <em>long</em> PR interval.</li><li>The <strong><em>isolated</em> finding</strong> of <strong>1st degree AV block</strong> (<em>even if marked</em>) is usually <em>not</em> clinically significant (<strong>Figure 02.70-1</strong>). This is especially true when a <em>prolonged</em> PR interval is seen in an otherwise <em>healthy</em> individual who does <em>not</em> have underlying heart disease. In contrast — <em>new</em> 1st degree AV block in a patient with <em>acute</em> evolving infarction (<em>especially if associated with other new conduction defects</em>) — is clearly cause for concern. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> <em>Clinical correlation is everything!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.70-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm with <strong>1st Degree AV Block</strong>. Each QRS complex is preceded by an <em>upright</em> P wave in this lead II rhythm strip with a <em>fixed</em> PR interval that clearly <em>exceeds</em> 1 large box in duration.</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> A PR interval that measures <strong>0.20 second</strong> is <em><strong>normal</strong></em>. The PR interval must be clearly <em>more</em> than this amount (ie, <em>>0.21-0.22 second</em>) to be “prolonged”.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Given the overall <em>benign</em> nature of <em>isolated</em> 1st degree AV block and the clinical reality that otherwise healthy young adults may manifest <em>slight</em> PR interval prolongation simply as a result of pronounced vagal tone (<em>especially in well-conditioned athletic individuals</em>) — <strong><em>our</em> preference</strong> is <em><strong>not</strong></em> to call** “1st degree AV block”** <em>until</em> the <strong>PR interval</strong> is <strong><em>clearly</em> 0.22 second</strong>. We also favor <em>not</em> using the term, <em>“borderline 1st degree”</em> when a PR interval in the 0.19-to-0.21 second range is seen in an otherwise healthy individual. All the term <em><strong>“borderline PR”</strong></em> means — is that you <em>almost</em> have a finding that <em>even if you had</em>, would clinically mean <em>nothing</em>. Instead — our preference is to describe the <strong>PR interval</strong> as <em>either</em> being <em><strong>“normal”</strong></em> or <strong>“long”</strong> (<em>where long means at least 0.21 second in duration, if not ≥0.22 second</em>).</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> <strong>Norms</strong> for the PR interval (<em>as well as for QRS interval duration</em>) are <strong><em>different</em> in children</strong>. Pediatric hearts are smaller. It therefore takes <em>less</em> time for the electrical impulse to travel through the conduction system of a child. For example — a PR interval of 0.18 second would be long for an infant. When in doubt about norms for a <em>younger-aged</em> patient — upper limits for the PR and QRS intervals should be* looked up* in an age-specific table.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.71 – The <em>3 Types</em> of 2nd Degree AV Block</strong></p><p>Second degree AV block is traditionally divided into two types (<strong>Mobitz I</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Mobitz II</strong>). That said — it is important to recognize that a <strong><em>third</em> type</strong> of 2nd degree AV block also exists (<em>known as</em>** 2:1 AV block**).</p><ul><li>The distinguishing characteristic of the 2nd degree AV blocks — is that some (<em>but not all</em>) P waves are conducted to the ventricles (<strong>Figure 02.71-1</strong>).</li><li>NOTE: The <strong><em>atrial</em> rate</strong> should be <strong>regular</strong> (<em>or almost regular</em>) when there is AV block (<em>arrows in</em> Figure 02.71-1). It is common to see slight variation (*known as *<strong><em>ventriculophasic</em> sinus arrhythmia</strong>) in the setting of 2nd or 3rd degree AV blocks. However — <em>marked</em> P wave irregularity — <em>change</em> in P wave morphology — or <em>prolonged</em> sinus pauses all suggest some phenomenon <em>other than</em> AV block is operative (ie, <em>blocked PACs; escape rhythms without AV block; sick sinus syndrome; sinus arrest</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.71-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm with the 3 types of <strong>2nd Degree AV Block</strong>. In each case — the atrial rhythm is <em>regular</em> and some (<em>but not all</em>) beats are conducted. <strong>Rhythm A</strong> — Mobitz I 2nd degree AV block with <em>gradual</em> prolongation of the PR interval until a P wave is dropped (<em>Section 02.72</em>). <strong>Rhythm B</strong> — Mobitz II with QRS widening and a <em>fixed</em> PR interval until <em>sudden</em> loss of conduction with <em>successive</em> nonconducted P waves (<em>Section 02.73</em>). <strong>Rhythm C</strong> — 2nd degree AV block with <strong>2:1 AV conduction</strong>. It is impossible to be certain if 2:1 AV block represents Mobitz I or Mobitz II, since we <em>never</em> see 2 conducted P waves in a row (<em>Section 02.74</em>).</p><p><strong>02.72 – Mobitz I 2nd Degree AV Block (<em>= AV Wenckebach</em>)</strong></p><p>Mobitz I (<em>AV Wenckebach</em>) — is by far the <em>most</em> common type of 2nd degree AV block (*accounting for ****more than 95% ***<em>of cases in our experience</em>). <strong>Mobitz I</strong> is <strong><em>recognized</em> by</strong>: <strong>i)</strong> Progressive <em>lengthening</em> of the PR interval <em>until</em> a beat is dropped; <strong>ii)</strong> Group beating; <strong>iii)</strong> A regular (<em>or at least fairly regular</em>) atrial rate; and <strong>iv)</strong> The pause that contains the dropped beat is <em>less</em> than twice the shortest R-R interval. These characteristics are known as <em><strong>“the Footprints of Wenckebach”</strong></em>. They are <em>all</em> present in <strong>Figure 02.72-1</strong>:</p><p><strong>Figure 02.72-1:</strong> Mobitz I 2nd Degree AV Block (= <em>AV Wenckebach</em>). The PR interval <em>progressively</em> lengthens until a beat is dropped (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>Regarding the <em><strong>“footprints”</strong></em> of <strong>Wenckebach</strong> that are seen in Figure 02.72-1:</p><ul><li>There is <em><strong>“group beating”</strong></em>. This takes the form of <strong>2 groups</strong> encompassing beats #1,2,3 and beats #4,5 (<em>each group being separated by a pause of approximately equal duration between beats #3-4 and between #5-6</em>).</li><li>The P-P interval is regular (<em>in this case at a rate of 100/minute</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Within</em> groups</strong> — the <strong>PR</strong> interval <strong><em>progressively</em> lengthens</strong> until a beat is dropped. Note the PR interval preceding beat #4 gets longer before beat #5 <em>until</em> the P wave <em>after</em> beat #5 is nonconducted. The next cycle then begins as the PR interval shortens prior to beat #6.</li><li><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Although AV Wenckebach is usually easy enough to diagnose simply by recognition of <em>progressive</em> PR interval lengthening <em>until</em> a beat is dropped — awareness of the <em>other</em> “footprints” may be helpful confirming the diagnosis in less obvious cases. <em>Not</em> all “footprints” are present in each case (ie, <em>Wenckebach cycles may be atypical</em>). However, <em>all</em> of the “footprints” are present in Figure 02.72-1. Note that in addition to <em>group</em> beating — regular <em>atrial</em> rate — and <em>progressive</em> PR interval lengthening — that the <strong>pause <em>containing</em></strong> the <strong><em>dropped</em> beat</strong> is <em><strong>less</strong></em> than** twice** the <strong><em>shortest</em> R-R interval</strong>. Thus, in the first group of beats in Figure 02.72-1 (<em>beats #1,2,3</em>) — the <em>shortest</em> R-R interval is between beats #2-3. The pause that contains the dropped beat (ie, <em>the pause between beats #3-4</em>) measures <em>less</em> than twice this R-R interval between beats #2-3.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Second degree AV block, <strong>Mobitz Type I</strong> — usually occurs at the level of the AV node. As a result — the QRS complex with Mobitz I will usually be narrow.</p><ul><li>Mobitz I is most often associated with <em>inferior</em> MI — it often <em>spontaneously</em> resolves — and it often responds to Atropine (<em>which works on the AV node</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.73 – Mobitz II 2nd Degree AV Block</strong></p><p>Mobitz II 2nd degree AV block — is recognized by QRS widening with a <strong><em>constant</em> PR interval</strong> for <strong><em>consecutively</em> conducted beats</strong> — *until *one or more beats are dropped (Figure 02.73-1).</p><ul><li><strong>Mobitz II</strong> — occurs <em>lower</em> down in the conduction system. As a result — the QRS complex is usually wide. The problem with Mobitz II is its disturbing tendency to <em>abruptly</em> go from regular conduction of P waves to <em>nonconduction</em> of multiple P waves in a row, sometimes leading to ventricular standstill. This explains why <strong>pacing</strong> is almost always needed with <em>true</em> Mobitz II 2nd degree AV block.</li><li>The features of Mobitz II are illustrated in <strong>Figure 02.73-1</strong>.

We can <em>not</em> be certain IF <strong>2:1 AV block</strong> represents Mobitz I or Mobitz II — because we <em>never</em> see 2 beats conducted in a row.

Therefore, IF there is clear evidence elsewhere that this patient manifested Mobitz I (<em>from the patients chart; from ongoing telemetry monitoring</em>) — then it is highly likely that the 2:1 AV conduction block seen in Figure 02.74-1 also represents Mobitz I.</li><li>Finally — IF 2:1 AV block occurs in association with <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> infarction</strong> — then <strong>Mobitz I</strong> is far more likely (<em>since occlusion of the right coronary artery commonly impedes blood supply to both the inferior wall of the left ventricle <em>and</em> the AV nodal artery</em>). In contrast — acute <em>anterior</em> infarction is much more likely to result in Mobitz II than Mobitz I AV block.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Although there is 2:1 AV block in Figure 02.74-1 — the ventricular rate is <em>not</em> overly slow (<em>the R-R interval is 6 large boxes; the ventricular rate is 50/minute</em>).

But because it is <em>rare</em> for 2nd degree AV block to alternate between Mobitz I and Mobitz II — it is <em>virtually</em> certain that the <em>entire</em> sequence of events seen in Tracings C and D of Figure 02.74-2 represent 2nd degree AV block, <strong>Mobitz I</strong>.</p><p><strong>02.75 – 3rd Degree (<em>Complete</em>) AV Block</strong></p><p>Complete (<em>or 3rd degree</em>) AV block — is said to be present when <em>none</em> of the impulses from above (<em>P waves</em>) are able to conduct to the ventricles. In this case — there is <strong><em>complete</em> AV Dissociation</strong> — because <em>none</em> of the P waves are related to any of the QRS complexes. The result is that <strong>2 <em>independent</em> rhythms</strong> are going on. One of these rhythms will be <strong><em>from</em> “above”</strong> (<em>in the form of regularly occurring sinus P waves</em>). The <em>other</em> ongoing rhythm will be <strong><em>from</em> “below”</strong> (<em>in the form of an escape rhythm originating either from the AV node, the His, or the ventricles</em>). Awareness of these features facilitates recognition and understanding of diagnostic criteria for what <strong>3rd degree AV block</strong> is — and <em>what</em> it is not:</p><ul><li>With complete AV block — *none *of the impulses from above (<em>sinus P waves</em>) are able to penetrate the AV node to arrive at the ventricles. As a result — there will be regular (<em>or almost regular</em>) atrial activity — and a regular (<em>or almost regular</em>) ventricular escape rhythm (<strong>Figure 02.75-1</strong>).</li><li>There is <strong><em>complete</em> AV dissociation</strong> in Figure 02.75.1 (ie, <em>none of the P waves are related to any QRS complexes</em>). As a result — <strong>P waves</strong> are seen to <em><strong>“march through”</strong></em> the <strong>QRS</strong>, occurring at <em>all</em> phases of the R-R cycle. This is most easily seen by focusing on <em>each</em> QRS complex in <em>both</em> Rhythm A and Rhythm B in Fig. 02.75-1 — and seeing that the PR interval immediately <em>preceding</em> each QRS <em>continually</em> changes.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.75-1:</strong> Anatomic levels of 3rd degree AV block. <strong>Rhythm A:</strong> Complete AV block at the <em>ventricular</em> level.

When this happens — the <strong>QRS</strong> of the <strong><em>escape</em> rhythm</strong> will be <em><strong>narrow</strong></em>. IF the escape rhythm arises from the <strong>AV node</strong> — the <strong><em>escape</em> rate</strong> will typically be <strong><em>between</em> 40-60/minute</strong> (<em>as seen in</em> <strong>Rhythm B</strong> *of *Fig. 02.75-1).</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> IF the escape rhythm arises from the <strong>Bundle of His</strong> — the QRS complex will again be <em>narrow,</em> but the escape rate may be slower. One may therefore surmise the <em>probable</em> anatomic level of block based on characteristics of the escape rhythm (<em>QRS width and escape rate</em>) — realizing that exceptions may exist in patients with preexisting conduction defects <em>and/or</em> influence by medications, hypoxemia, acute ischemia/infarction, etc.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**<em>KEY Clinical <em>Point:</em></em> More important than the anatomic level of block per se in <em>initial</em> management is the patient’s <em>hemodynamic</em> status. For example — a hypotensive patient with altered mental status and <em>complete</em> AV block associated with an escape rate of 40/minute will still be in dire need of immediate treatment <em>regardless</em> of whether the escape rhythm manifests a wide or narrow QRS complex.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Knowing that the escape rhythm QRS complex is <em>narrow</em> suggests <em>greater</em> potential for reversibility and <em>beneficial</em> response to Atropine.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.76 – PEARLS for Recognizing/<em>Confirming Complete</em> AV Block</strong></p><p>Most of the time IF the degree AV block is complete (<em>3rd degree</em>) — then <strong>the <em>ventricular</em> rhythm should be at least <em>fairly</em> regular</strong>.

Exceptions may occur during cardiopulmonary resuscitation — but even then, there will usually be a <em>recognizable</em> pattern of ventricular regularity.</p><ul><li>If the ventricular rhythm in a tracing with AV block is <em>not</em> regular (<em>or at least almost regular</em>) — then it is likely that <em>some</em> conduction is occurring (ie, <em>rather than 3rd degree <em>—</em> there is probably high-grade 2nd degree AV block</em>). Note that the R-R interval is regular for <em>both</em> examples of complete AV block shown in Figure 02.75-1.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>Confirmation</em> of <em>complete</em> AV block <em>requires</em> that <strong>P waves <em>fail</em> to conduct <em>despite</em> being given <em>adequate</em> opportunity to do so</strong>. Satisfying this requirement provides the evidence needed to distinguish complete AV block from AV dissociation due to other causes. To do this — one <em>must</em> see P waves in <em>all</em> phases of the R-R cycle (ie, <em>having opportunity to conduct <em>—</em> but still failing to do so</em>).</p><ul><li>For example, in <strong>Tracing A</strong> of Fig. 02.75-1 (<em>which we reproduce below</em>) — the P wave hidden within the T wave of beat #3 (<em>white arrow</em>) would <em>not</em> be expected to conduct to the ventricles (<em>because it occurs during the absolute refractory period</em>).

However, <em>all other P waves</em> in this tracing should have opportunity to conduct — yet <em>fail</em> to do so.</p><p><strong>Tracing B</strong> <em>from</em> <strong>Figure 02.75-1:</strong> Complete AV block at a <em>higher</em> level (<em>probably in the AV node</em>) — as suggested by the presence of a <em>narrow</em> QRS escape rhythm at a rate <em>between</em> 40-60/minute</p><p>**<em>KEY Clinical <em>Point:</em></em> In order to <em>guarantee</em> that P waves will have adequate opportunity to conduct — the rate of the escape rhythm should ideally <em>not</em> exceed 50/minute. Escape rates faster than this often result in inopportune timing of P waves that mitigates against having an adequate opportunity to conduct. In such instances (<em>when the escape rate is well over 50/minute</em>) — a much <em>longer</em> period of monitoring will be needed to ensure that the degree of AV block is complete. Note that the <em>escape</em> rate is <em>below</em> 50/minute for <em>both</em> examples of AV block in Figure 02.75-1 — further supporting our conclusion that the degree of AV block is indeed complete in <em>each</em> case.</p><p><strong>02.77 – AV Dissociation</strong></p><p>The term, <em><strong>“AV dissociation”</strong></em> — simply means that for a certain period of time sinus P waves are <em>not</em> related to neighboring QRS complexes. That is, the P waves preceding the QRS are <em>not</em> being conducted to the ventricles.</p><ul><li>AV dissociation may be intermittent, recurrent and short-lived – or – it may be persistent and permanent, as occurs with complete AV block.</li><li><strong>AV dissociation is <em>never</em> a “diagnosis”</strong>. Instead — it is a condition caused by “something else”. The task for the clinician is to figure out what the cause of AV dissociation is for any given rhythm. This assignment is far more than academic — since <em>appropriate</em> management depends on figuring out the cause of AV dissociation. Active treatment may or may not be indicated. For example — optimal treatment of <em>complete</em> AV dissociation with an accelerated junctional rhythm due to digitalis toxicity is simple: IF the patient is hemodynamically stable — simply <em>stop</em> digoxin! No pacemaker is needed <em>despite</em> that fact that <em>none</em> of the P waves on the tracing may be conducting.</li><li><strong><em>Complete</em> AV dissociation is <em>not</em> the same as <em>complete</em> AV block</strong>! This is one of the most commonly <em>misunderstood</em> concepts in all of arrhythmia interpretation. Complete AV block is just <em>one</em> of 3 possible causes of AV dissociation. As we will see momentarily — patients with “complete AV dissociation” may actually have <em>no</em> degree of AV block at all …</li><li>Always try to determine <em>which</em> of the <strong>3 Causes</strong> of** AV Dissociation** is operative. The 3 possible causes are: <strong>i) AV block</strong> itself (<em>either from 2nd or 3rd degree AV block</em>); <strong>ii) Usurpation</strong> — in which P waves <em>transiently</em> do not conduct because an <em>accelerated</em> junctional or ventricular rhythm takes over the pacemaking function (ie, <em>“usurps” the rhythm</em>); and <strong>iii) Default</strong> — in which a junctional or ventricular <em>escape</em> rhythm takes over by <em>&ldquo;default&rdquo;</em> because the rate of the sinus pacemaker has <em>slowed down</em> for whatever reason.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.78 – FIGURE 02.78-1: <em>Is there any AV Block?</em></strong></p><p>Consider the rhythm strip shown in <strong>Figure 02.78-1</strong>.

If so — what <em>degree</em> of AV block is present? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.78-1:</strong> Full interpretation of the rhythm strip shown here is problematic because: <strong>i)</strong> We are <em>not</em> provided with information about the clinical setting; <strong>ii)</strong> The rhythm strip is short (<em>just over 4 seconds in duration</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> We do <em>not</em> get to see the <em>immediately-preceding</em> rhythm strips that are likely to reveal what is truly going on. That said — what <em>can</em> be stated about the rhythm in <strong>Figure 02.78-1</strong> is the following:</p><ul><li>The <strong><em>underlying</em> rhythm</strong> appears to be <strong>sinus</strong> – as suggested by <strong>beat #1</strong> which is preceded by an <em>upright</em> P wave with <em>reasonable</em> PR interval (<em>of 0.18 second</em>) in this lead II monitoring lead.</li><li>The <strong><em>ventricular</em> rhythm</strong> is <em><strong>regular</strong></em> at a rate <strong><em>just over</em> 50/minute</strong> (<em>the R-R interval is just under 6 large boxes in duration</em>).</li><li>The <strong>QRS</strong> complex is <em><strong>narrow</strong></em>. For practical purposes — this means that the rhythm is <strong>supraventricular</strong> (<em>arising from either the SA node as in sinus rhythm <em>—</em> or from the AV node</em>).</li><li>The <strong>P waves <em>preceding</em> beats #3</strong> and** #4** in Fig. 02.78-1 are definitely <strong><em>not</em> conducting</strong>. They <em>can’t</em> be — since the PR interval preceding these beats is clearly <em>too short</em> to conduct.</li><li>The P wave preceding <strong>beat #2</strong> is also probably <em>not</em> conducting. Although the PR interval preceding beat #2 is <em>not</em> necessarily “too short to conduct” — it is clearly <em>less</em> than the PR interval preceding beat #1. Given that we <em>know</em> the P waves preceding beats #3 and #4 are not conducting — it is highly likely that the P wave preceding beat #2 is also <em>not</em> conducting.</li><li>The <strong><em>atrial</em> rate</strong> (<em>as defined by the P-P interval</em>) is <em><strong>regular</strong></em> at <strong>50/minute</strong> (<em>the P-P interval is precisely 6 large boxes in duration</em>).</li><li>Regardless of whether the P wave preceding beat #2 is or is not conducting — <em><em>the</em> “theme”</em>** of the rhythm in Figure 02.78-1 is that there is <strong>initial <em>sinus</em> bradycardia</strong> (<em>beat #1</em>) at a rate of 50/minute — followed by a period of AV dissociation (<em>since P waves preceding subsequent beats are definitely not conducting</em>). This is <strong>AV Dissociation <em>by</em> Default</strong> (ie, <em>default from sinus node slowing that allows emergence of an appropriate junctional escape rhythm at 52/minute</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>KEY Clinical</em> Point:</strong> There really is <em>no</em> evidence of any AV block at all in Figure 02.78-1. <em>None</em> of the P waves that fail to conduct have any reasonable chance to conduct (<em>since the PR interval is simply too short before an appropriate junctional escape rhythm supervenes</em>).</p><ul><li>What occurs in Figure 02.78-1 is commonly seen among healthy adolescents and young adults during sleep <em>and/or</em> undergoing anesthesia. The sinus rate <em>temporarily</em> slows — and an <em>appropriate</em> junctional escape rhythm arises to the rescue. There is <em>no</em> AV block. There is <em>no</em> pathology. There is <em>no</em> need for acute intervention. Instead — optimal treatment is “benign neglect” (<em>the clinician is perhaps better off not knowing that transient AV dissociation may be occurring in such otherwise healthy and asymptomatic individuals</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> The <strong><em>correct</em> diagnosis</strong> for the rhythm in <strong>Figure 02.78-1</strong> is: <em>Sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by default, resulting in an appropriate junctional escape rhythm at 52/minute</em>. Nothing more need be written in your interpretation.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Although we assumed that beat #1 in Figure 02.78-1 is conducting — We actually do <em>not</em> know for certain that this is true. This is because we <em>never</em> see 2 beats in a row that conduct with the same PR interval. Therefore, <em>it could be</em> that the patient’s <em>underlying</em> rhythm is sinus with <em>marked</em> 1st degree AV block — and that beat #1 also manifests AV dissociation. That said, <em>regardless</em> of whether or not beat #1 is conducting — the “theme” of this rhythm is still sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by default. The need for clinical correlation to guide management remains the same (ie, <em>no immediate intervention is needed IF the patient is asymptomatic and the setting benign</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.79 – SUMMARY: <em>Complete AV Block <em>vs</em> AV Dissociation</em></strong></p><p>We summarize the subject of AV Dissociation by <strong>Figure 02.79-1</strong> — in which all 3 the causes are illustrated. Note the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Rhythm A</strong> in Figure 02.79-1: Although there is obvious AV dissociation (<em>since the PR interval for several P waves is too short to conduct</em>) — there is <em>not</em> necessarily any AV block. We interpret this rhythm as sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by <em><strong>default</strong></em> — resulting in an <em>appropriate</em> junctional <em>escape</em> rhythm at 52/minute (*See Answer to *Fig. 02.78-1).</li><li><strong>Rhythm B:</strong> There is <strong>AV dissociation <em>by</em> usurpation</strong>. Beats #1 and #2 are sinus conducted with a normal PR interval. The PR interval then shortens. We <em>know</em> that P waves preceding beats #4 and #5 in Rhythm B are <em>not</em> conducting (<em>the PR interval is clearly too short to conduct</em>). No P waves at all are seen after beat #5. The reason is that an <strong><em>accelerated</em> junctional rhythm</strong> (<em>at 78/minute</em>) has <em><strong>“usurped”</strong></em> the pacemaking function from the SA node (<em>that was beating at 75/minute</em>). This situation is commonly seen in <strong><em>digitalis</em> toxicity</strong>. Although the sinus P waves preceding beats #4 and 5 in Rhythm B are <em>not</em> conducting (<em>and the P preceding beat #3 is probably also not conducting</em>) — <em>none</em> of these P waves have any reasonable chance to conduct. Thus, despite <em>nonconduction</em> of P waves — there is <em>no</em> evidence of any AV block. It is likely that AV dissociation will spontaneously <em>resolve</em> once the cause of the accelerated junctional rhythm is discovered and corrected.</li><li><strong>Rhythm C:</strong> There is <strong>AV dissociation <em>due to</em> 3rd Degree AV Block</strong>. As opposed to Rhythm A and Rhythm B, in which <em>nonconducting</em> P waves <em>do not have any reasonable chance</em> to conduct — P waves in <strong>Rhythm C</strong> occur at <em>all</em> points in the cardiac cycle. We would anticipate that virtually <em>all</em> of the P waves indicated by <em>solid red arrows</em> in Rhythm C should have a chance to conduct. Despite this — <em>none</em> of these P waves conduct. Instead — <strong>P waves <em>“march through”</em> the QRS</strong> throughout Rhythm C. In addition — the ventricular escape rhythm is <em>less</em> than 50/minute. <strong>Rhythm C</strong> therefore fulfills criteria for <strong><em>complete</em> AV block</strong> as the cause of AV dissociation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.79-1:</strong> The 3 causes of AV dissociation. <strong>Rhythm A</strong> — AV dissociation by <em><strong>default</strong></em> of the sinus pacemaker which has slowed; <strong>Rhythm B</strong> — AV dissociation by <em><strong>usurpation</strong></em> of the rhythm by another <em>accelerated</em> pacemaker (<em>which in this case arises from the AV node</em>); and <strong>Rhythm C</strong> — AV dissociation due to <strong>AV block</strong> — which could be <em>either</em> 2nd degree, or as in Rhythm C, a <strong>3rd degree AV block</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>02.80 – <em>High-Grade</em> 2nd-Degree AV Block</strong></p><p>A term is needed to describe the situation in <strong>Figure 02.80-1</strong>.</p><ul><li>How would you interpret this rhythm?</li><li>Is there AV block?

We establish this by recognition of: <strong>i)</strong> a regular <em>atrial</em> rate; and <strong>ii)</strong> the fact that <em>some</em> P waves conduct but others <em>do not</em>.</p><ul><li>The conduction disturbance in Figure 02.80-2 is clearly <em>not</em> simple 1st degree AV block. We can also recognize <em>at a glance</em> that this rhythm is <em>not</em> 3rd degree AV block because: <strong>i)</strong> the ventricular rhythm is <em>not</em> at all regular (<em>Section 02.76</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> <em>some</em> P waves are conducting. Therefore — the rhythm in Figure 02.80-2 must be a form of <strong>2nd degree AV block</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.80-2:</strong> <em>Arrows</em> have been <em>added</em> to Figure 02.80-1 to indicate <em>regularly</em> occurring P waves <em>throughout</em> the tracing. <em>Some</em> P waves conduct — but <em>others don’t</em>. The rhythm is therefore <strong>2nd degree AV block</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Which Form</em> of 2nd-Degree AV Block</strong>**?** There are features of <em>each</em> type of 2nd degree AV block in Figure 02.80-2:</p><ul><li>The first 3 beats are consistent with <strong>Mobitz I</strong> because: <strong>i)</strong> Mobitz I is far more common than Mobitz II; <strong>ii)</strong> the QRS complex is narrow; and <strong>iii)</strong> the PR interval <em>progressively</em> increases from beat #1 — to beat #2 — to beat #3. The P wave after beat #3 is nonconducted. The cycle then resumes with <em>shortening</em> of the PR interval prior to beat #4.</li><li>There is <strong>2:1 AV block</strong> for beats #4, 5 and 6 — as <em>every-other-P wave</em> is conducted (<em>confirmed by the constant PR interval preceding the QRS complex of beats 4, 5, 6</em>).</li><li>Two P waves <em>in a row</em> are nonconducted between beat #3 and beat #4. While on occasion, multiple successive <em>nonconducted</em> P waves may be seen with Mobitz I 2nd degree AV block — this finding is <em>much more suggestive</em> of a more severe <strong>Mobitz II</strong> conduction disturbance (<em>Section 02.73</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> <em>More</em> important than determining the specific <em>“type”</em> of 2nd degree AV block for the rhythm in Figure 02.80-2 are: <strong>i)</strong> the <em>hemodynamic</em> effect of the conduction defect; and <strong>ii)</strong> clinical implications and potential need for a pacemaker. As a compromise to reflect our <em>increased</em> clinical concern given <strong><em>successive</em> nonconduction of P waves</strong> — we favor use of the term <strong><em>“high-grade”</em> AV block</strong> for the conduction disturbance seen in Figure 02.80-2.</p><ul><li>NOTE: There are <em>many</em> variations on the above “theme” — in which the degree of AV block is <em>not quite complete</em> and <em>not</em> necessarily conforming to either pure Mobitz I or Mobitz II — yet clearly of <strong><em>increased</em> clinical concern</strong> due to nonconduction of multiple beats with resultant overly <em>slow</em> ventricular rate.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**02.81 – <em>Ventricular <em>Standstill vs AV Block</em></em></p><p>Confusion sometimes arises in the terminology used to describe certain ventricular or arrest rhythms related to complete AV block. The 4 rhythms illustrated in <strong>Figure 02.81-1</strong> will hopefully clarify the terminology used:</p><ul><li><strong>Rhythm A</strong> (*repeated from *Figure 02.75-1) — represents <strong><em>complete</em> AV block</strong> at the ventricular level. There is a regular <em>atrial</em> rhythm (<em>red arrows</em>) and a regular <em>ventricular</em> rhythm — but <em>none</em> of the P waves conduct to the ventricles. Instead — P waves <em>“march through”</em> the QRS complex with a <em>continually</em> changing PR interval. Note that the ventricular escape rate is slow (<em>well below 50/minute</em>) — and that P waves have more than adequate <em>opportunity</em> to conduct, yet still <em>fail</em> to do so (<em>Section 02.75</em>).</li><li><strong>Rhythm B</strong> — represents <strong><em>ventricular</em> standstill</strong>. Atrial activity continues (<em>in the form of regularly-occurring P waves</em>) — but <em>no</em> QRS complexes are seen. Clinical implications of this rhythm are usually the same as for asystole.

Reasons for this increase are multiple — but include the obesity epidemic with corresponding increase in the incidence of diabetes and improved treatment of diabetes resulting in increased longevity. As a result — many more patients with diabetes now live long enough to develop complications associated with <em>end-stage</em> kidney disease. Hyperkalemia is perhaps the most immediately <em>life-threatening</em> complication seen in this group of patients.</p><ul><li>Many more patients than ever before are now on <strong>dialysis</strong>. Hyperkalemia should <em>always</em> be thought of in such patients whenever they present with either an unusual (<em>or bizarre</em>) 12-lead ECG <em>and/or</em> a cardiac arrhythmia.</li><li>Chronic kidney disease patients who are not yet on dialysis may also develop hyperkalemia — especially if any of a number of <strong><em>predisposing</em> situations</strong> are present. Among others, these include: <strong>i)</strong> taking potassium-retaining medications (<em>ACE-inhibitors; angiotensin-receptor-blocking drugs; certain diuretics; potassium supplements</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> dehydration; <strong>iii)</strong> acidosis; <strong>iv)</strong> abrupt reduction in urine output; and <strong>v)</strong> cardiac arrest.</li><li><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> is <em><strong>notorious</strong></em> for its ability to <strong>mimic <em>other</em> ECG conditions</strong> (<em>Section 11</em>). Among ECG changes produced by more severe degrees of hyperkalemia (<em>common once serum potassium exceeds 6-6.5 mEq/L</em>) include: <strong>i)</strong> marked <em><strong>peaking</strong></em> of <strong>T waves</strong> in multiple leads; <strong>ii) QRS widening</strong>; <strong>iii) <em>reduced</em> P wave amplitude</strong> — sometimes with complete <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of <strong>P waves</strong> (<em>despite persistence of sinus conduction</em>); <strong>iv)</strong> bizarre frontal plane <strong><em>axis</em> shifts</strong>; and <strong>v) ST-T wave changes</strong> that may mimic ischemia/acute infarction (<em>ST elevation or depression; T wave peaking and/or deep T wave inversion</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>Relevance of the above information on Hyperkalemia to this Section on AV Block is highlighted by the rhythm in <strong>Figure 02.82-1</strong>.</p><ul><li>Should the patient whose rhythm is shown in Figure 02.82-1 be treated with Atropine <em>and/or</em> pacing?</li><li>HINT: How might your answer to this question <em>change</em> IF told that this patient was alert and had a history of chronic kidney disease?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.82-1:</strong> Ventricular rhythm at ~40/minute.

(<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 02.82-1:</strong> A regular ventricular (<em>wide QRS</em>) rhythm is seen in this tracing at a rate of ~40/minute. There are no P waves. While our <em>initial</em> impression is that of a <strong>ventricular <em>escape</em> rhythm</strong> (<em>as most commonly occurs in a setting of cardiac arrest</em>) — pending the need for <em>additional</em> information, <strong><em>other</em> possibilities</strong> should be entertained. For example — IF told that this patient was hemodynamically stable, alert and on longterm dialysis (<em>or that he/she had a history of chronic kidney disease</em>) — then a <strong><em>stat</em> potassium</strong> value becomes essential for optimal management:</p><ul><li>QRS <em>widening</em> — the <em>slow</em> ventricular rate — <em>lack</em> of P waves — and suggestion of T wave <em>peaking</em> in Figure 02.82-1 are <em>all</em> consistent with a <em>possible</em> diagnosis of hyperkalemia.</li><li>IF the diagnosis is <strong>hyperkalemia</strong> — then <strong><em>immediate</em> treatment</strong> would be <em>very different</em> than treatment of slow ventricular escape in a patient with cardiac arrest whose serum potassium is normal. As opposed to Atropine, use of a pressor agent <em>and/or</em> Pacing — <strong>IV Calcium</strong>, <strong>Bicarb</strong> <em>and/or</em> <strong>D50 <em>plus</em> Insulin</strong> may become the treatment(s) of choice.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>02.83 – FIGURE 02.83-1: <em>Is there any AV Block at all?</em></strong></p><ul><li>We conclude this brief section on AV block with the rhythm in <strong>Figure 02-63</strong>.

P waves <em>are</em> present — and 2 P waves are seen for each QRS (*blue and red arrows in *<strong>Figure 02.83-2</strong>) — but P waves are <em>not</em> regular in this rhythm strip. This is the 1st clue that the rhythm in Figure 02.83-2 does <em>not</em> represent a form of AV block (<em>Section 02.71</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 02.83-2:</strong> Red and blue arrows have been added to Figure 02.83-1 (<em>See text</em>).</p><ul><li><em>Every-other-P wave</em> in Figure 02.83-2 is conducting. We <em>know</em> this — because the PR interval preceding <em>each</em> QRS on the tracing is constant (<em>blue arrows</em>). Therefore — the <strong><em>underlying</em> rhythm</strong> is <strong>sinus</strong>.</li><li><em>Every-other-P wave</em> is early (<em>red arrows</em>). Note P wave morphology of each <em>early</em> P wave is <em>different</em> in shape (<em>triphasic</em>) than the <em>biphasic</em> P wave of sinus beats. Thus, the rhythm is <strong><em>atrial</em> bigeminy</strong>. <em>Every-other-P</em> wave is a PAC that occurs <em>so early</em> that it is blocked (<em>red arrows</em>).</li><li>**<em>Bottom <em>Line:</em></em> The rhythm in Figure 02.83-2 is a fitting way to end this Section on AV Blocks. <em><strong>The most common cause of a pause</strong></em> — is a <strong><em>blocked</em> PAC</strong>. <em>Blocked</em> PACs are far <em>more</em> common than any form of AV block. They <em>will</em> be found IF looked for. Remembering this clinical reality (<em>Section 02.68</em>) — and remembering to <em>always</em> assess <em>each</em> cardiac rhythm <em><strong>systematically</strong></em> by the <strong>Ps, Qs & 3R Approach</strong> will facilitate recognizing AV block when it <em>does</em> occur — and help <em>avoid</em> misdiagnosis when instead one of the <em>AV-block-mimics</em> is present.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.0 – Doing an ECG / Technical Errors</strong></p><p>The importance of correct lead placement and awareness of potential technical mishaps cannot be overstated. We begin this Section with overview comments on lead derivation and placement. This will enhance appreciation of the PEARLS we then present on <em>recognizing</em> artifact and lead placement errors.</p><p><strong>03.1 – <em>Limb</em> Leads: <em>Basic Concepts/Placement</em></strong></p><p>A <strong><em>standard</em> ECG</strong> is recorded by use of <strong>10 electrodes</strong>, which results in a recording that shows <strong>12 ECG leads</strong>. Four of these electrodes are “limb lead electrodes” — which are placed on each of the 4 extremities (<strong>Figure 03.1-1</strong>). The other 6 electrodes are placed on the chest, as described in Section 03.6.</p><p><strong>Figure 03.1-1:</strong> Limb lead electrodes are placed on each extremity (<em>left panel</em>). Derivation of the 3 <em>standard</em> limb leads (<em>leads I,II,III</em>) is shown in the <em>right</em> panel. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The <strong>4th <em>extremity</em> electrode</strong> is placed on the <strong><em>right</em> leg</strong> (<strong>RL</strong>). This RL electrode had traditionally been used as a ground lead — though in modern ECG recording systems, it is now used more to reduce external interference.</p><p>Note on the <em>left</em> in Figure 03.1-1 — that the <strong>4 limb lead electrodes</strong> are shown placed on the 4 extremities — but that on the <em>right</em> we schematically suggest a more <em>proximal</em> location for limb lead electrode placement.</p><ul><li>Depending on institution practice where you reside — you are likely to encounter <em>other</em> slight variations in such placement. The “good news” — is that since (<em>for the most part</em>) — the body is a fairly homogeneous conductor of electricity — there will usually be no more than minimal (<em>if any</em>) variation in QRS morphology as a result of such variation in electrode lead placement.</li><li>That said — Realize that there may on occasion be variation in QRST morphology because of different limb lead electrode placement (<em>Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>). For example — <em>small</em> Q waves may be present on one tracing and <em>not</em> on another. This could potentially lead to misinterpretation of new or prior infarction**. PEARL:** <em>Be consistent!</em> Do <em>not</em> change electrode placement at your site of practice from one day-to-the-next. Ensuring that all who record ECGs in your site of practice use the <em>same</em> electrode lead placement procedure will lead to consistency — and enable effective use of comparison serial tracings to establish that new findings are truly &ldquo;new&rdquo; (<em>and not the result of different recording technique</em>).</li><li>Despite one&rsquo;s best efforts to be consistent in recording limb lead placement — there may still on occasion be instances when you&rsquo;ll need to deviate slightly from procedure. Examples include patients with limb amputation <em>and/or</em> patients with significant tremor that impedes more distal placement. The <em>KEY</em> in such instances is to note <em>on the actual ECG</em> what the problem is (ie, <em>marked tremor</em>) — and what the change in recording procedure is that you have made (ie, <em>&ldquo;used more proximal lead placement”, or other adjustment</em>). This way — IF you encounter a change in QRST morphology — you&rsquo;ll <em>know</em> that altered technique may have had a contributing role in producing that change.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.2 – <em>Why 10 Electrodes but 12 Leads?</em></strong></p><p>The reason there are only 10 electrodes <strong>(<em><strong>but 12 standard ECG leads</strong></em>)</strong> — is that <strong>one</strong> of the electrodes (<em>on the right leg</em>) is <em>not</em> used to derive ECG waveforms — and the 6 limb leads are derived from the remaining <strong>3</strong> extremity electrodes (<em>on the right arm, left arm, and left leg</em>). Together with the <strong>6</strong> chest lead electrodes — this makes a total of 1+3+6 = <strong>10 electrodes</strong> used to record <strong>12 ECG leads</strong>.</p><ul><li>The theoretical basis of electrocardiography arose from the premise put forth by <strong><em>Willem</em> Einthoven</strong>, who in 1903 invented the first ECG machine. Einthoven stated that the <em><strong>heart</strong></em> lies in the <em><strong>center</strong></em> of an <strong><em>equilateral</em> electrical triangle</strong> (Figure 3.2-1) While anatomically, the heart is <em>not quite</em> at the “center” of this triangle — Einthoven’s original premise remains accurate enough that more than 100 years later, this concept still explains many of the fundamental principles of electrocardiography.</li><li>An <strong>ECG</strong> recording is simply the <strong><em>graphic</em> representation</strong> of the <strong>heart’s <em>electrical</em> activity</strong>. It is *nothing more — <em>and <em>nothing less</em>. This electrical activity is recorded by the 10 monitoring electrodes</em> — *and then displayed in a series of waveforms that make up the standard 12-lead ECG.</li><li><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> An electrical wavefront travels from a <em>negative</em> to <em>positive</em> recording electrode. A wave of depolarization that is seen as <em>approaching</em> a monitoring electrode — will write an **<em>upward <em><strong>(<em>positive</em>)</strong> deflection</em></em> on ECG in the lead it approaches. It will write a **<em>downward <em><strong>(<em>negative</em>)</strong> deflection</em></em> in the lead it moves away from.</li><li><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> Einthoven <em>arbitrarily</em> selected the <strong><em>left</em> shoulder</strong> (= <strong>LA</strong> —* or left arm*) to be <em><strong>positive</strong></em> when recording <strong>lead I</strong>. The groin (= <strong>LL</strong> —* or left leg*) electrode was selected to be positive when recording leads II and III. In this way — a <em>majority</em> of QRS complexes in the limb leads will be predominantly positive in <em>most</em> leads in the electrocardiograms of <em>most</em> individuals (<strong>Figure 03.2-1</strong>).</li><li><strong>NOTE-3:</strong> As will be discussed in Section 03.3 — the ECG waveform that is seen on ECG for the 3 <em>standard</em> limb leads (<em>leads I,II,III</em>) is derived from the <em>difference</em> in electrical potential <em>between</em> 2 of the limb lead electrodes.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.2-1:</strong> Electrically — the heart lies near the “center” of an <em>equilateral</em> triangle (<strong><em>Einthoven’s</em> Triangle</strong>). Because <em>each</em> of the angles in an <em>equilateral</em> triangle has <strong>60 degrees</strong> — each of the <strong>standard <em>limb</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I,II,III</em>) are separated from each other by 60 degrees. The ECG waveform for each of these limb leads is derived from the <em>difference</em> in electrical potential <em>between</em> 2 of the limb lead electrodes (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> In 2007 — an esteemed group of electrocardiography experts put forth an ACC/AHA/HRS <em>Scientific</em> Statement of Recommendations for <em>Standardization</em> and Interpretation of the ECG (<em>Kligfield et al. — JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>). The stated goal of this consensus report was to reassess the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Among the many insightful conclusions arising out of this publication (<em>many of which are described in this Section 3</em>) — is that the term, “unipolar” should <em>no longer</em> be used.</p><ul><li>In the past — it was said that 3 of the 12 leads on a <em>standard</em> ECG were “bipolar” (= <em>leads I,II,III</em>) — and the <em>other</em> 9 leads (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF;</em> and <em>V1-thru-V6</em>) were “unipolar”. <em>No longer! <em>The ACC/AHA/HRS Consensus Report emphasized that</em></em>* all* leads are effectively “bipolar”.**</li><li>In the past — derivation of the 3 <em>augmented</em> leads (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF</em>) was determined from the difference in electrical potential between the respective anatomic recording site <em>minus</em> a central null vector. This process is no longer used. Instead — all 12 leads now use a <em>derived</em> electrode to serve as the <em>opposing</em> electrode for any lead pair.</li><li><strong><em>Chest</em> leads</strong> use Wilson’s central terminal as the opposing <em>derived</em> electrode (<em>Section 03.6</em>). In contrast — the 3 <strong><em>augmented</em> leads</strong> (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF</em>) use the Goldberger central terminal. The central terminal <em>previously</em> used during the early days of electrocardiography was derived from the mean potential of RA, LA and LL electrodes. As a result — the amplitude of complexes recorded from these extremity leads was low because the potential from the recording site was part of the central terminal. Thus, the recording potential was partially <em>subtracted</em> from the total potential displayed on the ECG. By <em>removing</em> the potential of the lead being recorded from the central terminal — Goldberger was able to <em><strong>augment</strong></em> the <strong>amplitude</strong> of recording complexes <strong><em>by</em> 50%</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Abbreviations of Societies contributing to the Consensus Report:</p><ul><li>ACC — American College of Cardiology.</li><li>AHA — American Heart Association.</li><li>HRS — Heart Rhythm Society.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.3 – Derivation of the <em>Standard</em> Limb Leads (<em>Leads I,II,III</em>)</strong></p><p>As stated — the ECG waveform in the <strong>3 <em>standard</em> limb leads</strong> is derived from the <em>electrical difference</em> between 2 of the standard limb lead electrodes. From <strong>Figure 03.2-1</strong> — it can therefore be seen that the electrical potential of standard <strong>lead I</strong> is a result of the <strong>electrical <em>difference</em></strong> between the LA and RA recording electrodes. Since the electrical wavefront travels from negative to positive — <strong><em>positive</em> Lead I</strong> is directed <em>toward</em> the left arm in a horizontal plane that corresponds to an angle of <strong><em>zero</em> degrees</strong>. As we will see momentarily (<em>in Section 03.5</em>) — zero degrees is our **<em>starting <em>point</em></em> in the <em>Hexaxial</em> Lead System</p><ul><li>It follows (<em>from</em> Fig. 03.2-1) — that the electrical potential of standard** Lead II** is the <em>difference</em> between the LL and RA electrodes.</li><li><strong>Lead III</strong> — is derived from the <em>difference</em> between the LL and LA electrodes.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Reproduced</em> Figure 03.2-1:</strong> Einthoven’s triangle. The ECG waveform for each of the 3 <em>standard</em> limb leads (<em>I,II,III</em>) is derived from the <em>difference</em> in electrical potential <em>between</em> 2 of the limb lead electrodes (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> The <strong>4 <em>limb lead</em> electrodes</strong> (<em>placed on the RA,LA,LL and RL extremities</em>) — serve to define the 6 frontal plane limb leads.</p><ul><li>The <strong>RL</strong> (<em>Right Leg</em>) <strong>electrode</strong> — serves as an electronic reference that helps attenuate unwanted noise (<em>interference</em>). This <strong>RL electrode</strong> (<em>which is not shown in</em> Fig. 03.2-1) — is <em>not</em> used in the derivation of any of the limb leads.</li><li>This leaves <strong>3 <em>pairs</em></strong> of <strong>electrodes</strong> to generate the ECG waveforms of the 6 limb leads. Within <em>each</em> pair — one electrode is established as the <em>positive</em> end of the lead — whereas the <em>other</em> electrode of the pair is deemed the <em>negative</em> end. For example (<em>as seen in</em> Figure 03.2-1) — <strong>Lead I</strong> is derived from the electrical difference between the LA <em>minus</em> the RA electrodes (LA-RA), whereby the LA electrode is <em>positive</em> and the RA electrode is <em>negative</em>.</li><li>Since the sum of voltage gains and voltage drops within the <em>closed</em> circuit of the 3 standard limb leads is equal to zero (<em>according to</em> <em><strong>Einthoven’s</strong></em> Law) — the potential of <strong>lead II =</strong> the potential of** lead I + lead III** at <em>any</em> instant of time in the cardiac cycle.</li><li><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> Because the potential of Lead II = Lead I + Lead III — <em>any</em> of the 3 <em>standard</em> limb leads can be mathematically derived from the <em>other</em> 2 leads. Therefore — the 3 standard limb leads contain <em>only</em> 2 independent pieces of information (<em>Kligfield et al. — JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.4 – The 3 <em>Augmented</em> Leads (<em>Leads aVR,aVL,aVF</em>)</strong></p><p>In addition to the 3 <em>standard</em> limb leads (<em>I,II,III</em>) — there are 3 <strong><em>augmented</em> limb leads</strong>. These are <strong>Lead aVR</strong> —** Lead aVL** — and** Lead aVF**. These 3 extremity leads record the difference in electrical potential between the respective extremity lead site and the Golderberger reference central terminal (<em>Section 03.2</em>). For practical purposes — the orientation for each of these <strong>3 <em>augmented</em> leads</strong> (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF</em>) can be thought of as an <em>outwardly</em> directed line extending from the electrical center of the heart to the particular electrode site on the right arm; left arm; or left leg (<em>outwardly directed <em><strong><em>red</em> arrows</strong></em> in</em> <strong>Figure 03.4-1</strong>).</p><ul><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> As discussed in Section 03.2 — Leads aVR, aVL and aVF are known as the **<em>&ldquo;augmented&rdquo; <em>leads</em></em> (<em>which accounts for the little <em>“a”</em> preceding VR, VL and VF</em>). The reason for this “a” — is that these extremity leads normally produce a relatively <em>small</em> electrical potential. This smaller electrical potential is magnified (ie, <em>augmented</em>) by approximately 50% through use of the Goldberger central reference system. Doing so results in comparable <em>relative</em> size for the QRST complex in all 12 leads of a standard ECG.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.4-1:</strong> Hexaxial lead system with lead orientation in number of degrees displayed for the 6 limb leads. Electrical orientation for the <strong>3 standard <em>limb</em> leads</strong> (<em>I,II,III</em>) — is depicted by <em>outwardly</em> directly <em>yellow</em> arrows at 0, +60 and +120 degrees. Orientation for the <strong>3 <em>augmented</em> leads</strong> (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF</em>) — is depicted by <em>outwardly</em> directly <em>red</em> arrows. <strong>Lead aVR</strong> — is in the upper right quadrant; <strong>lead aVF</strong> — is vertical at +90 degrees; <strong>lead aVL</strong> — is in the upper left quadrant at -30 degrees (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> As alluded to in Section 03.2 — the Goldberger central terminal is now used as the opposing electrode for each of the extremity leads instead of Wilson’s central terminal that was used in the past. The Goldberger central terminal is derived by dividing the sum of the electrical potential of the other 2 extremity leads by two. That is, for <strong>lead aVR</strong> — this value is (LA + LL)/2; for <strong>lead aVL</strong> — it is (RA + LL)/2; and for <strong>lead aVF</strong> — it is (RA + LA)/2.</p><ul><li><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> It is <em>not</em> important to try to memorize these <em>hard-to-remember</em> relationships! <strong><em>What</em> IS important</strong> — is to appreciate that the ECG waveform for <em>each</em> of the 3 <em>augmented</em> leads can be <em>derived</em> simply from knowing the ECG appearance of any 2 of the 3 standard limb leads! Thus, from a mathematical standpoint — there is <strong><em>much</em> redundancy</strong> of information. Among the 12 standard leads that make up an ECG — there are <em>only</em> 8 independent pieces of information (<em>because 1 of the 3 standard limb leads <em>and</em> all 3 of the augmented leads are derived from the other 2 limb leads</em>)!</li><li>**<em>BOTTOM <em>Line:</em></em> The AHA/ACC/HRS Consensus Report wants clinicians to recognize the <em>derived</em> and <em>redundant</em> nature of the 6 limb leads. Technically — only 2 leads are needed to reproduce all ECG waveforms in these 6 leads (<em>Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>). That said — all 6 limb leads are retained because their use facilitates understanding and clinical interpretation (ie, *it would seem far more difficult and contrived to contemplate diagnosis of acute inferior MI from only seeing lead I and lead II *— <em>although this theoretically is possible</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.5 – The <em>Hexaxial</em> Lead System</strong></p><p>Figure 03.4-1 puts together lead orientation for the <strong>6 <em>limb</em> leads</strong>. This composite makes up what is known as the <em><strong>“Hexaxial Lead System”</strong></em>.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead I</strong> — is a <em><strong>l</strong></em><em>ateral <em>(<em><strong>l</strong></em></em>eftward</em>) monitoring lead that views the heart&rsquo;s electrical activity from a *horizontally *oriented vantage point defined as <strong>0 degrees</strong>. This is our **<em>starting <em>point</em></em> in the <em>Hexaxial</em> Lead System.</li><li>In contrast to lead I — <strong><em>standard</em> Lead II</strong> and <strong>Lead III</strong> are **<em>inferior <em>leads</em></em> that respectively view the heart&rsquo;s electrical activity from vantage points angulated at <strong>+60</strong> and <strong>+120 degrees</strong> relative to the heart&rsquo;s electrical center.</li><li><strong>Lead aVL</strong> — is another <em><strong>l</strong></em><em>ateral <em>(<em><strong>l</strong></em></em>eftward</em>) monitoring lead (Figure 03.4-1). It records the heart&rsquo;s electrical activity from a vantage point that looks down at the heart from the patient&rsquo;s <em><strong>l</strong></em>*eft *shoulder (<em>from a position that corresponds to an angle of <strong><strong>-30 degrees</strong></strong> with respect to the heart&rsquo;s electrical center</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead aVF</strong> — is an <em>inferior <em>monitoring lead. The recording electrode is placed on the patient&rsquo;s <em>left</em> lower extremity — and the heart&rsquo;s electrical activity is viewed from a vantage point that looks directly up at the heart from the patient&rsquo;s <em><strong>f</strong></em></em>eet</em>. This provides a *perpendicular *vantage point (*that corresponds to an angle of *<em><strong>+90 degrees</strong></em>).</li><li><strong>Lead aVR</strong> — is the last of the augmented leads. It is the most distant recording electrode. Lead aV<strong>R</strong> views the heart from afar — looking down from the patient&rsquo;s <em><strong>r</strong></em>*ight *shoulder. Because the heart sits in the left side of the chest — the heart’s electrical activity will generally be directed <em>away</em> from this <em>right-sided</em> and most distant recording electrode. As a result, for practical purposes — QRST morphology in lead aVR usually contributes <em>little</em> to interpretation of most tracings (<em>with notable exception when there is lead misplacement or dextrocardia</em>). <strong>PEARL:</strong> There <em>are</em> some additional important clinical situations in which lead aVR may provide <em>invaluable</em> information to assist our interpretation (<em>We cover this concept in detail in Sections 09.31thru-through 09.40 devoted to How to Use Lead aVR</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.6 – <em>Precordial</em> Lead Placement</strong></p><p>In addition to 3 limb and 3 <em>augmented</em> leads — <strong>6 <em>more</em> leads</strong> are routinely included in a <strong><em>standard <em>12-lead ECG</em></em>. These are the <strong>precordial <em>chest</em> leads</strong> — which view the heart’s electrical activity in the <em><strong>transverse</strong></em> (<em>horizontal</em>)</strong> plane**. These 6 precordial leads are positioned according to <strong><em>anatomic</em> landmarks</strong> (Figure 03.6-1). As opposed to the 3 <em>augmented</em> limb leads (<em>aVR,aVL,aVF</em>) which are connected within a <em>closed</em> electrical loop — the 6 precordial* chest *leads are <em>independent</em> of each other (ie, <em>they are based on electrical activity assessed from their specific recording site — <em>and</em> cannot be derived from other electrodes as the 6 limb leads can</em>).</p><ul><li>The electrical recording from each chest lead is derived from the <em>difference</em> in potential between the respective anatomic recording site and a reference central terminal. For the chest leads — the central terminal used is the one first derived by Wilson in the 1930s. This central terminal is equal to mean potential from the RA, LA and LL electrodes (<em>roughly corresponding to the center of Einthoven’s equilateral triangle</em>).</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Each of the 6 precordial (<em>chest</em>) leads provides <em>independent</em> information based on electrical activity recorded from its respective anatomic site (<em>as shown in</em> Figure 03.6-1) — minus the potential from a central reference terminal. Clinically — the viewpoint of each <em>precordial</em> lead on a 12-lead tracing correlates with the anatomic area of the heart that lies below it.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.6-1:</strong> Anatomic landmarks for <em>precordial</em> lead placement (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>03.7 – Use of <em>Additional</em> Leads</strong></p><p><em>Most</em> of the time — the 12 viewpoints provided by a <strong><em>standard</em> 12-lead ECG</strong> convey adequate information to <em>appropriately</em> evaluate and manage the patient. That said — there <em>are</em> occasions when use of <strong><em>additional</em> leads</strong> may be helpful. Most commonly, these <em>extra</em> viewpoints include one or more <em>right-sided</em> leads (*especially *<strong>lead V4R</strong>) — and/or use of <em>posterior</em> leads (<em>V7,<strong><strong>V8</strong></strong>,<strong><strong>V9</strong></strong>,V10</em>).</p><ul><li>The goal of considering <strong><em>additional</em> leads</strong> is to facilitate recognition of acute RV (<em>Right Ventricular</em>) and/or <em>posterior</em> infarction. This objective has resulted in preference by some for a <strong>15-lead ECG</strong> (<em>addition of V4R, V8, V9 to the standard 12 leads</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead V4R</strong>: — same placement as lead V4, but on the <em>right</em> chest.</li><li><strong>Lead V8:</strong> — placed in the back at the tip of the left scapula at the <em>same</em> horizontal level of lead V6.</li><li><strong>Lead V9:</strong> — placed in the back in the left paraspinal area in between the scapula and posterior spine, level with V6.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Our</em> Bias:</strong> We prefer to <em><strong>start</strong></em> with <strong>12 leads</strong>. <em>Most</em> of the time — 12 leads are <em>all</em> that are needed to determine optimal <em>initial</em> management. That said — it is good to be aware of those situations for which use of <em>additional</em> leads may be helpful (*We return to this concept in Section 10.31 on acute RV MI *— <em>and in Section 10.36 on diagnosis of posterior MI</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> — Opinions vary regarding need for 12 vs 15 leads. Clearly, a balance must be struck between <em>urgency</em> of the situation — <em>How Long</em> it will take to obtain additional leads — and whether this time is really worth what you’ll <em>actually</em> learn from getting more leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>03.8 –</em> Technical</em> Errors: <em>Angle of Louis and Lead V1</em>**</p><p>Accurate placement of <strong><em>precordial</em> leads</strong> on the chest is essential. Placing a <em>precordial</em> lead as little as one IC (<em>Intercostal Space</em>) either too high or too low can dramatically alter QRS morphology and amplitude.</p><ul><li>The <em>KEY</em> to determining **<em>correct <em>placement</em></em> of precordial leads is to first identify the <em><strong>Angle of Louis</strong></em>. This can be done by lowering your finger from the **<em>manubrial <em>notch</em></em> (<em>in the midline at the upper edge border of the sternum</em>) — until it comes to lie on a small **<em>horizontal <em>ridge</em></em>. The **2nd <em>intercostal <em>space</em></em> lies just <em>below</em> this point (<strong>Figure 03.8-1</strong>).</li><li>Drop down 2 additional intercostal spaces (<em>to the</em> <strong><em>4th intercostal</em> space</strong>) — and move <em>just to the right</em> of the sternum to locate the reference position for <strong>Lead V1 (<strong>Figure 03.6-1 <em>and</em> Figure 03.8-1</strong>)</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.8-1:</strong> Anatomic landmarks (<em>Angle of Louis</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Amazingly — <strong><em>inaccurate</em> placement</strong> of <strong>lead V1</strong> remains one of the most common technical errors committed. From description of <em>precordial</em> lead placement in Figure 03.6-1 — it should be obvious that IF the <em>wrong</em> intercostal space is used for placement of lead V1 — that <em>all</em> precordial leads will be inaccurately placed!</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>03.9 –</em> Technical</em> Mishaps: <em>Important Caveats</em>**</p><p>Be aware of the following caveats:</p><ul><li>In ***women ***— recording electrodes should be placed <em>under</em> the left breast to avoid precordial lead placement errors. This is especially problematic in women with large breasts. That said — consensus is lacking as to optimal electrode placement in women because of inconsistent literature results on the effect lead placement has on ECG waveforms. The amount of voltage attenuation by breast tissue appears to be variable — and reproducibility of precordial lead placement is often precarious, depending on experience of the technician; breast size, shape and adiposity; and small changes in patient position. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> The AHA/ACC/HRS Consensus Statement still recommends electrodes be placed <em>under</em> the breast at this time — but this recommendation may change pending additional study (<em>Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>). Until that time — the <em>KEY</em> is <em>consistency</em> of lead placement in any given patient!</li><li><strong>Lead V5</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>lead V6</strong> should both be placed <strong><em>level with</em> lead V4</strong>. This is <em>preferred</em> to the 5th intercostal space, which was the <em>previously</em> recommended reference point (<em>Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>). The reason for recommending placement of leads V5 and V6 at the same horizontal level as lead V4 — is that the course of each intercostal space is variable.</li><li>Definition of <strong>lead V5</strong> as <strong><em>midway between</em> V4</strong> and <strong>V6</strong> is a <em>more reproducible</em> landmark than the anterior axillary line — especially in cases when body habitus precludes accurate identification of the anterior axillary line (<em>Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007</em>).</li><li>***Chest wall abnormalities ***— are a common source of placement errors. These include pectus excavatum or carinatum (<em>hollow or pigeon breast</em>) — severe emphysema — and large body habitus, among others. Making a small mark on the chest where the leads were placed will hopefully clarify lead placement and promote consistency with <em>serial</em> tracings.</li><li>***Is the Bed Flat? ***— Often overlooked is the effect that <em><strong>inclination</strong></em> of the <strong>bed</strong> may have on the 12-lead ECG recording. Patients with **<em>acute <em>dyspnea</em></em> (<em>as is common with acute heart failure, COPD, pulmonary embolism</em>) — may simply <em>not</em> be able to lie flat when first seen. Inclination of the bed by 20-30 degrees may <em>either</em> “produce” Q waves or make Q waves disappear (<em>especially in the limb leads</em>). Be sure to note the <em>angle</em> of the bed when the ECG is recorded if it is not flat. This will hopefully resolve the problem of *inferior *Q waves “coming and going” as the patient gets better or worse.</li><li>***Comparing Serial Tracings ***— Remember to take into account the effect that a <em>change</em> in axis or precordial lead placement may have on the QRS and on ST-T waves. IF the mean QRS axis has <em>changed</em> between one tracing and the next — then the reason for a new Q wave seen on a subsequent tracing may be the <em>change</em> in axis (<em>and not necessarily the result of infarction</em>). Similarly — a change in precordial lead placement may dramatically alter QRS amplitude and morphology. The task of determining whether differences are due to a true ECG change vs axis shift/placement may be challenging!</li><li>***Arm *Leads **— should ideally be placed between shoulders and the wrists, away from bony prominences. <strong><em>Leg</em> Leads</strong> — should be placed between hips and ankles, away from bony areas. IF for whatever reason more proximal lead placement (<em>of limb leads on the trunk</em>) is used — this should be noted on the tracing. <em>Consistency is key</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>03.10 –</em> Important</em> Concepts: <em>Lead Misplacement/Dextrocardia</em>**</p><p>Although we include technical mishaps discussed in this Section 03 at an <em>early</em> point in this ECG ePub — many of these concepts are advanced. You’ll want to return to this section often …</p><p><strong>QUESTIONS on <em>KEY</em> Concepts:</strong></p><ul><li>What might be wrong <em>technically</em> in <strong>Panel A</strong> and <strong>Panel B</strong> of Figure 03.10-1?</li><li>How could you verify the cause for the <em>unexpected</em> appearance in each case?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.10-1:</strong> Which technical mishaps do you suspect? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Panel A in Figure 03.10-1:</strong> The most common error in lead placement is mixing up left and right arm electrodes. Suspect this (<em>or dextrocardia</em>) — IF there is: i) **<em>global <em>negativity</em></em> in <strong>lead I</strong> (<em>negative P, QRS and T wave</em>); ii) an <em>upright</em> QRS complex in <strong>lead aVR</strong> — and iii) a *negative *P wave in <strong>lead II</strong>. All 3 of these findings are present in Panel A:</p><ul><li>Normally — the <strong>QRS</strong> in *left-sided *<strong>Lead I</strong> will be <em><strong>upright</strong></em> (<em>assuming the heart lies in the left side of the thorax</em>). Lateral infarction may produce a Q in lead I — but usually there is <em>at least some</em> R wave. <strong>You should <em>never</em> see <em>“global negativity”</em> in lead I</strong> (<em>unless there is dextrocardia <em>or</em> lead reversal</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead aVR</strong> — should normally show a **<em>negative <em>QRS</em></em> complex. The heart’s electrical activity normally moves toward the <em>left</em> — or <em>away</em> from <em>right-sided</em> lead aVR. About the <em>only</em> time you won’t see global negativity in lead aVR — is with <em>marked</em> RVH (<em>unless there is dextrocardia <em>or</em> lead reversal</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead II</strong> — should <em>always</em> show an <strong><em>upright</em> P wave</strong> IF the rhythm is sinus. The path of electrical activity from the SA Node to the AV Node is virtually parallel to the +60 degree angle of lead II (<em>Section 02.3</em>). Therefore — IF the P wave in lead II is <em>not</em> upright — then the rhythm is <em>not</em> sinus (<em>unless there is dextrocardia <em>or</em> lead reversal</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Panel B:</strong> We <em>reproduce</em> Panel B from Figure 03.10-1 below in <strong>Figure 03.10-2</strong>. Which technical mishap do you suspect? <em>Explain</em> your answer.</p><p><strong>Figure 03.10-2:</strong> Which technical mishap do you suspect from the schematic <em>precordial</em> lead sequence shown here? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 03.10-2:</strong> Lead V2 in the <em>precordial</em> lead sequence in Panel B simply does <em>not</em> make sense. There is not only <em>loss</em> of r wave from lead V1 to V2 — but an <em>upright</em> T wave is also seen between negative T waves in <em>neighboring</em> leads V1 and V3. <em>Suspect an error in precordial lead placement!</em></p><ul><li><strong><em>Key</em> Point:</strong>* Unusual* R wave progression (ie, <em>abrupt transition; sudden loss or gain of R wave that only lasts for a single lead</em>) — should suggest precordial lead misplacement. IF ever in doubt — <em><strong>Repeat the ECG!</strong></em></li></ul><p> </p><p>*<em>03.11 – Dextrocardia:</em> ECG Recognition ***</p><p>Dextrocardia is rare — but it <em>does</em> occur. The average clinician will see *no more *than a handful of cases in his/her lifetime. Dextrocardia typically produces the **<em>same <em>ECG picture</em></em> in the limb leads as <em>right-to-left</em> arm lead reversal. That is — ***lead I looks like aVR should look **<em>(<em>there is global negativity</em>) — and lead aVR looks like lead I should look with a positive QRS complex (<strong>Panel A</strong></em> in *Figure 03.11-1).</p><p><strong>QUESTION on <em>Recognizing</em> Dextrocardia:</strong></p><ul><li>IF the limb leads in <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 03.11-1 were the result of <strong>dextrocardia</strong> — Would you expect the <em>precordial</em> lead sequence to look more like Panel C or Panel D?</li><li>Which <em>precordial</em> lead sequence would you expect IF the limb leads were the result of <strong><em>limb lead</em> reversal</strong>?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.11-1:</strong> Limb lead appearance in <strong>Panel A</strong> is consistent with <em>either</em> limb lead reversal or dextrocardia. Which <em>precordial</em> lead sequence (<strong>C</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>D</strong>) would you expect if the patient had dextrocardia?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 03.11-1:</strong> Panel C in Fig. 03.11-1 shows <em>normal</em> R wave progression in the <em>precordial</em> leads. Note gradual (<em>progressive</em>) increase in R wave amplitude as one moves from lead V1-<em>toward</em>-V4 with — transition (<em>where the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep</em>) occurring at normal location <em>between</em> V3-to-V4 (<em>Section 09.5</em>).</p><ul><li>IF the <em>limb</em> leads shown in <strong>Panel A</strong> were accompanied by the <em>precordial</em> lead sequence in <strong>Panel C</strong> — this would suggest simple <strong><em>lead</em> reversal</strong> (<em>because R wave progression is normal as expected when the heart lies in the left hemithorax</em>).</li><li>On the other hand — We would suspect <em><strong>Dextrocardia</strong></em> IF the <em>limb</em> leads in <strong>Panel A</strong> were accompanied by the <em>precordial</em> lead sequence in <strong>Panel D</strong> — because <strong><em>reverse</em> R wave progression</strong> is seen. That is, the R wave is <em>tallest</em> in lead V1 of Panel D — and becomes progressively <em>smaller</em> as one moves across the <em>left</em> precordium. This is as one would expect IF the heart was in the <em>right</em> hemithorax.</li><li><em><strong>Confirmation</strong></em> of <strong>Dextrocardia</strong> is easy: <strong>i)</strong> Listen to the heart (<em>heart sounds will be heard on the right</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Chest X-Ray will show a *right-sided *heart shadow; and/or <strong>iii)</strong> Repeat the ECG with precordial leads placed on the right — and you will now see <em>normal</em> R wave progression.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em>** **There are many potential variations of dextrocardia, each with its own particular characteristics. Thus, the heart may lie on the right — but the atria and ventricles may be arranged normally (<em>dextroversion</em>). Alternatively — the heart may be a <em>mirror</em> image of normal, with the atria and ventricles reversed. The great vessels and other visceral organs may or may not be reversed. The <strong>P wave</strong> in <strong>lead II</strong> may or may not be negative —depending on the nature of associated anatomic abnormalities. <em>Regardless</em> of P wave appearance in lead II — a form of dextrocardia should be suspected IF <em>ever</em> you see <strong>global <em>negativity</em> in lead I</strong> <em>with</em> <strong>QRS positivity in lead aVR</strong>. Confirmation can then be forthcoming by: <strong>i)</strong> listening on the right for heart sounds; <strong>ii)</strong> Chest x-ray; <em>and/or</em> <strong>iii)</strong> Repeating the ECG with precordial leads placed on the right (<em>which will now show normal R wave progression</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.12 – PRACTICE: <em>Identifying Technical Errors</em></strong></p><p>Consider the following series of tracings (<em>Sections 03.13-thru-03.23</em>).

That said — the rhythm is <strong><em>not</em> AFlutter</strong> because: <strong>i)</strong> The undulations we see in lead II and elsewhere are <em>not</em> nearly regular enough to represent the 300/minute consistent <em>“sawtooth”</em> pattern of atrial flutter; and <strong>ii)</strong> We can see regular underlying P waves (<em>red arrows in</em> <strong>Figure 03.13-2</strong>).</p><ul><li>Note that the P waves highlighted by <em>red arrows</em> in Figure 03.13-2 are <em>unaffected</em> by the baseline artifact!</li><li>Clinically — one look at the patient <em>confirmed</em> that the baseline activity was artifact from a marked <em>resting</em> tremor. <strong>PEARL:</strong> Be aware that the rate of a <strong>Parkinsonian <em>resting</em> tremor</strong> is often close to the rate of AFlutter.</li><li>NOTE: We have already seen the lead II rhythm strip from this patient (<em>Section 02.25</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.13-2:</strong> <em>Arrows</em> have been added to Figure 03.13-1 to highlight <em>underlying</em> sinus P waves.

This is especially true for beat #6 — which is wide and perfectly placed where one might expect a PVC to occur. That said — we <em>know</em> that there are <strong><em>no</em> PVCs</strong> on this tracing. Instead there is <strong>artifact</strong>. We say this because:</p><ul><li>There are baseline undulations seen throughout the tracing — especially during the last half of the tracing.

IF beat #7 was a PVC — there is <em>no way</em> that beat #8 could conduct (<em>since it would doubtlessly fall within the absolute refractory period of beat #7</em>).

That said — this rhythm is <em>unlikely</em> to be AFlutter because:</p><ul><li>A true sawtooth pattern is absent.

This strongly suggests that these short vertical spikes represent <strong>artifact</strong>.</li><li>NOTE: We are <em>not</em> at all certain what the rhythm in Figure 03.15-1 is. A <strong>12-lead ECG</strong> would be needed to comment further — as this will reveal IF flutter or other atrial activity is seen in other leads. What <em>can</em> be said from <strong>Tracing C</strong> in Fig. 03.15-1 is the following: <strong>i)</strong> The rhythm looks to be supraventricular (<em>narrow QRS in this MCL-1 lead</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> The rhythm is almost but <em>not</em> completely regular (<em>slight but definite variation in R-R intervals of some beats when measured with calipers</em>); <strong>iii)</strong> No definite P waves are seen (<em>although we can’t be sure if atrial activity is or is not present elsewhere without a 12-lead tracing</em>); and <strong>iv) Artifact</strong> appears to be present. <em>Pending</em> results of a 12-lead ECG — We <em>suspect</em> the rhythm is <strong><em>probably</em> AFib</strong> (<em>Atrial Fibrillation</em>) given <em>lack</em> of P waves and <em>slight-but-definite</em> irregularity in the rhythm.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.16 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing D</em></strong></p><p>What <em>might</em> be wrong?</p><p><strong>Figure 03.16-1:</strong> Practice Tracing D.</p><p><strong>Answer to Tracing D:</strong> There is <strong><em>global</em> negativity</strong> in <strong>lead I</strong> (<em>of the P wave, QRS and T wave</em>). This should virtually <em>never</em> occur normally. The most likely causes of global negativity in lead I are: <strong>i)</strong> LA-RA (<em>Left Arm-Right-Arm</em>) lead reversal; and <strong>ii)</strong> Dextrocardia (<em>Sections 03.10 and 03.11</em>).</p><ul><li>In addition to <em>global</em> negativity in lead I — Note that the P wave, QRS complex and T wave in <strong>lead aVR</strong> are <em>not</em> negative as they usually are under normal circumstances. This is consistent with <em>either</em> lead reversal or dextrocardia.</li><li><strong>R wave progression</strong> is <em><strong>normal</strong></em> in Tracing D (<em>with transition occurring between lead V3-to-V4</em>). This defines the problem as **<em>limb lead <em>reversal</em></em> and <em>not</em> dextrocardia (<em>Section 03.11</em>).</li><li>The diagnosis of <strong>LA-RA <em>limb lead</em> reversal</strong> was <em>confirmed</em> by <em><strong>repeating</strong></em> the <strong>ECG</strong> <em>after</em> verifying correct limb lead placement (<strong>Figure 03.16-2</strong>).

Of the <em>estimated</em> 300 million ECGs obtained annually worldwide — as many as 6 million ECGs (~<em>2% of the total</em>) are thought to manifest <em>some</em> technical mishap (<em>Rowlands DJ: J Electrocardiology 41:84-90, 2008</em>). Awareness of how to recognize technical mishaps when they occur is therefore essential!</p><ul><li>There are 6 ways to commit a <em>single</em> limb lead misconnection (<em>RA-LA; RA-RL; RA-LL; LA-RL; LA-LL; and RL-LL</em>). The number of possible errors increases if <em>multiple</em> lead mix-ups are included among the possibilities. Recall of the specific ECG pattern likely to be seen by each of these technical mishaps is challenging even for the advanced interpreter. Fortunately — it is <em>not</em> necessary to recall each particular ECG pattern <em>as long as</em> you recognize that one or more leads are misconnected.</li><li><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> The most common form of lead misconnection is the easiest to recognize. This is <strong>LA-RA</strong> (<em>Left Arm-Right Arm</em>) <strong><em>limb lead</em> reversal</strong> — in which the ECG waveform in lead I looks like aVR, and vice versa (*Sections 03.10, 03.11 *— <em>and</em> Figure 03.16-1).</li><li><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> Lead misconnections as well as anatomic errors in placement may also occur in precordial leads.

Its occasional occurrence is an almost <em>inevitable</em> consequence of the quantity of ECGs that are ordered. Clinically — A <strong><em>possible</em> limb lead misconnection</strong> should be <em>suspected</em> IF <em>any</em> of the following findings are present:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Global</em> negativity</strong> in <strong>lead I</strong>.</li><li>A predominantly <strong><em>positive</em> QRS</strong> complex in <strong>lead aVR</strong>.</li><li>A <strong><em>negative</em> P wave</strong> in <strong>lead II</strong>.</li><li>A <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong> (<em>completely flat line</em>) in <em>any</em> of the limb leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> It is prudent to suspect <em>possible</em> lead misplacement on recognition of <em>any</em> of the above findings. The “good news” — is that it is usually <em>easy</em> to check out IF your suspicion is accurate: Simply <em><strong>repeat the ECG</strong></em> to see if the abnormal finding goes away.</p><ul><li>Apply these concepts to the ECG examples we show in Sections 03.17-thru-03.19.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.17 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing E</em></strong></p><p>What <em>might</em> be wrong?</p><p><strong>Figure 03.17-1:</strong> Practice Tracing E.</p><p><strong>Answer to Tracing E:</strong> A <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong> (<em>totally flat line</em>) is seen in <strong>lead III</strong>. This should virtually <em>never</em> occur normally. The most likely cause of a null vector in lead III, but an otherwise fairly normal tracing — is <strong>LA-RL</strong> (<em>Left Arm-Right Leg</em>) <strong><em>limb lead</em> reversal</strong>.</p><ul><li>As emphasized in the beginning of this Section (<em>in</em> Figure 03.1-1) — the <strong>RL</strong> (<em>Right Leg</em>) <strong>electrode</strong> serves as a <em>zero</em> electrical potential (<em>ground lead</em>) reference point.</li><li>Lead misconnections involving the RL electrode typically produce a <em>predictable</em> ECG pattern. With <strong>LA-RL lead reversal</strong> — Leads I and II look the same; leads aVL and aVF look the same — and <strong>lead III</strong> records a <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong>. This is <em>precisely</em> the pattern we see in <strong>Figure 03.17-1</strong>. Note that <em>precordial</em> lead R wave progression in Fig. 03.17-1 is normal (<em>with transition occurring between V3-to-V4</em>).</li><li>IF on the other hand, there was <strong>RA-RL lead reversal</strong> — Leads I and aVL will look the same (<em>with a negative QRS</em>); leads aVR and aVF look the same (<em>with a positive QRS</em>) — and it will be <strong>lead II</strong> that records a <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong> (Figure 03.18-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Many “brain cells” are required to commit the expected <em>specific</em> ECG patterns of LA-RL and RA-RL lead reversal to memory. This is <em>not</em> needed clinically — because <em><strong>all that counts is recognition that some type of lead misconnection is possible</strong></em>. Awareness of the 4 <em>easy-to-remember</em> ECG findings cited in Section 03.16.2 should be all that is needed to recognize most clinically significant lead misconnections. Look for one or more of the following: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Global</em> negativity in lead I; <strong>ii)</strong> A predominantly <em>positive</em> QRS complex in lead aVR; <strong>iii)</strong> A <em>negative</em> P wave in lead II; <em>and/or</em> <strong>iv)</strong> A <em>null</em> vector (<em>completely flat line</em>) in <em>any</em> of the limb leads.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The electrical potential recorded from the <strong>RL</strong> electrode is virtually <em>identical</em> to that recorded from the <strong>LL</strong> electrode (<em>zero in each case</em>). As a result — <strong><em>RL-LL</em> misconnection</strong> does <em>not</em> change the relationships in Einthoven’s triangle — because <em>both</em> RL and LL electrodes record a similar <em>zero</em> electrical potential. This means you will <em>not</em> be able to recognize RL-LL misconnection based on ECG appearance. That said — this does* not* matter, because the 12-lead ECG will be essentially <em>unchanged</em> if RL and LL electrodes are inadvertently misconnected.</li><li>Acknowledgement: My appreciation to David Richley (<em>of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK</em>) for allowing me to use this tracing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.18 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing F</em></strong></p><p>What <em>might</em> be wrong?</p><p><strong>Figure 03.18-1:</strong> Practice Tracing F.</p><p><strong>Answer to Tracing F:</strong> A <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong> (<em>totally flat line</em>) is seen in <strong>lead II</strong>.

This is <em>not</em> the obvious global negativity appearance that we have previously seen in Figure 03.16-1 and Figure 03.18-1 — in which we <em>knew</em> something was “wrong”. But — the P wave in <em>left-sided</em> lead I is usually <em>not</em> decidedly negative when the P wave is positive in lead II as it is here. In addition — the Q wave in lead I is clearly <em>too deep</em> to be a normal “septal” q wave. While possible the Q waves in leads I and aVL represent prior high lateral infarction — the <em>possibility</em> of a <strong><em>technical</em> mishap</strong> should be considered.</li><li><em>Both</em> the P wave and QRS complex in <strong>lead aVR</strong> are positive. This <em>shouldn’t</em> normally be if all leads are correctly placed <em>unless</em> there is marked underlying structural abnormality.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Impression of Figure 03.19-1:</strong> In addition to the <em>unusual</em> appearance of leads I and aVR — overall QRS amplitude in Fig. 03.19-1 is greatly reduced (<em>with the largest QRS complex surprisingly being recorded in lead V1</em>) — there is marked frontal plane axis deviation — and precordial R wave progression is reversed. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Something is <em>very wrong</em> here.</p><ul><li>Our first reaction to seeing the ECG in Figure 03.19-1 — is to find out more about the patient. <em>Are there symptoms?</em> Any history of heart disease or prior infarction?</li><li>Is there a <em>prior</em> ECG?</li><li>What does physical examination show? Are heart sounds heard on the <em>left</em> side of the chest?</li><li>Is there a chest x-ray?</li><li>What does a <strong><em>repeat</em> ECG</strong> look like after verifying that all leads are correctly placed?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Follow-Up</em> to the Case:</strong> Heart sounds were heard on the <em>right</em> side of the chest. The ECG was repeated with <em>precordial</em> leads placed on the <em>right</em> (<strong>Panel B</strong> <em>in</em> <strong>Figure 03.19-2</strong>). The patient had <em><strong>dextrocardia</strong></em>.</p><ul><li>As discussed in Sections 03.10 and 03.11 — there are <em>many</em> potential forms of dextrocardia. The common “theme” on ECG — is that the appearance of leads I and aVR is <em>reversed</em> with dextrocardia from what you would normally expect. This is indeed the case in Figure 03.19-1.</li><li>It is easy to <strong><em>confirm</em> dextrocardia</strong> (<em>Section 03.11</em>):** i)** Heart sounds are heard on the right; <strong>ii)</strong> Chest x-ray shows a <em>right-sided</em> heart shadow; and <strong>iii) <em>Repeat</em> ECG</strong> with precordial leads placed on the right at least partially <em>normalizes</em> R wave progression. While admittedly, R wave progression in <strong>Panel B</strong> of Figure 03.19-2 is not “normal” (<em>since a predominant R wave is never seen</em>) — <em>right-sided</em> placement of precordial leads clearly results in an <em>increase</em> in positive forces, as would be expected if the heart was situated on the <em>right</em> side of the chest.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 03.19-2:</strong> Comparison between the <em>original</em> precordial lead sequence seen in Figure 03.19-1 (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — with the precordial lead sequence on <strong><em>repeat</em> ECG</strong> with precordial leads now placed in comparable anatomic location, but on the <em>right</em> side of the chest (<strong>Panel B</strong>). Note that while a predominant R wave is never attained in Panel B — there is nevertheless a decided <em>increase</em> in positive QRS amplitude that supports the diagnosis of <strong>dextrocardia</strong>.</p><ul><li>Acknowledgement: My appreciation to Dawn Altman (<em>of the ECG Guru</em>) for allowing me to use these tracings.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>03.20 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing H</em></strong></p><p>Beat #5 was interpreted as either a PVC or an <em>aberrantly</em> conducted PAC. <em>Do you agree?</em></p><p><strong>Figure 03.20-1:</strong> Practice Tracing H.</p><p><strong>Answer to Tracing H:</strong> At first glance — <strong>beat #5</strong> looks like a legitimate early beat, especially in leads I, II and aVR.

The effect this may have on the ECG recording is obvious when compared to the <strong><em>repeat</em> ECG</strong> performed on this patient a short while later with <em>verified</em> correct lead placement (<strong>Panel B</strong>).</p><ul><li>Note <em>loss</em> in amplitude of the <em>initial</em> r wave in leads V1 and V2 when chest leads are placed too high (<strong>Panel A</strong>). In addition — an rSr’ (<em>incomplete RBBB</em>) pattern with T wave inversion was seen in <em>both</em> leads V1,V2 in Panel A — but is <em>no longer</em> seen in <strong>Panel B</strong> when the ECG is repeated with <em>correct</em> chest lead placement.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Note:</strong> The importance of correct chest lead placement <em>cannot</em> be overstated (<em>Sections 03.6 and 03.7</em>).

That said — it does not make sense for the S wave that disappeared after lead V4 to abruptly reappear with a predominant S>R wave in lead V6. Instead — it would make much more sense if the waveform currently seen in lead V6 was recorded in lead V4 (<em>with the current V4 and V5 recordings being instead from V5 and V6</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Simply ***repeating the ECG ***after verifying chest lead placement is an <em>easy</em> way to know for certain what the <em>true</em> precordial lead ECG appearance in <strong>Tracing K</strong> should be.</p><p><strong>04.0 – Intervals (PR/QRS/QT)</strong></p><p><strong>04.1 – What are the 3 Intervals in ECG Interpretation?</strong></p><p>As per the <strong><em>Systematic</em> Approach</strong> introduced in Section 01.1 — <em>after</em> assessing a 12-lead ECG for Rate <em>and</em> Rhythm — one then looks to determine the <strong>3 ECG Intervals</strong> (Figure 04.1-1):</p><ul><li>The **<em>PR <em>interval</em></em> — is defined as the period that extends from the <em>onset</em> of <em>atrial</em> depolarization (<em>beginning of the P wave</em>) — until the onset of <em>ventricular</em> depolarization (<em>beginning of the QRS complex</em>).</li><li>The <strong><em>QRS</em> complex</strong> itself (<em>discussed more in Section 05.1</em>).</li><li>The <strong><em>QT</em> interval</strong> — the period from the onset of the QRS complex <em>until</em> the end of the T wave (<em>See Section 06.1</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 04.1-1:</strong> The 3 <strong>ECG Intervals</strong> (<em>= the PR – QRS – QT intervals</em>). Measure intervals in the lead where the interval looks <em>longest</em>. Precise determination of an interval is usually <em>not</em> necessary if it falls within the normal range.</p><p><strong>04.2 – The PR Interval: <em>What is Normal?</em></strong></p><p>The <em>best</em> lead to assess the PR interval in is usually <strong>lead II</strong>. The P wave should be <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in lead II if the rhythm is sinus. In adults — the PR interval is considered <em><strong>normal</strong></em> if it measures <em>between</em> <strong>0.12</strong> and <strong>0.20 second</strong> (<em>See</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 04.2-1).</p><ul><li>The <strong>PR interval</strong> is <em><strong>&ldquo;short&rdquo;</strong></em> — if it measures <em><strong>less</strong></em> than <strong>0.12 second</strong> in duration in lead II (<strong>Panel B</strong>). One cause of a <em>short</em> PR interval is WPW (<em>Wolff-Parkinson-White</em>) syndrome in which an AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>) exists that <em>bypasses</em> the AV node, thereby requiring <em>less</em> time for the impulse to arrive in the ventricles (<em>See Section 05.37</em>). <strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Not</em> all patients with a short PR interval (<em>0.12 sec.</em>) have WPW. Instead — the PR interval may sometimes be short because it is anatomically small or conduction is fast. <em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The chance that a patient has an AP becomes greater when the PR interval is very short (ie, <em>0.10 second</em>).</li><li>The <strong>PR interval</strong> is <em><strong>“long”</strong></em> — if it measures <em><strong>more</strong></em> than <strong>0.20-0.21 second</strong>. One can tell at a glance if the PR interval is long — by looking to see IF it is clearly <em>more</em> than 1 <em>large</em> box in duration (<strong>Panel C</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 04.2-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 04.2-1:</strong> Limits of the PR interval. <strong>Panel A</strong> — The PR interval is normal (<em>between 0.12-0.20 second in adults</em>). <strong>Panel B</strong> — the PR interval is short (<em>less than 0.12 second</em>). <strong>Panel C</strong> — the PR interval is long (<em>clearly more than one large box in duration</em>).</p><p><strong>04.3 – The PR Interval: <em>Clinical Notes</em></strong></p><p>When the PR interval is long — We say there is <strong><em>1st-degree</em> AV block</strong>. Given that the <em>isolated</em> finding of 1st degree AV block (<em>even if marked</em>) is usually <em>not</em> clinically significant (<em>Section 02.70</em>) — we generally <em><strong>undercall</strong></em> this finding. <em>Our</em> preference is to accept a PR interval = 0.21 second as normal (<em>and not to call 1st degree until the PR interval is <em><strong>≥0.22 second</strong></em> = definitely more than 1 large box</em>). The PR interval in <strong>Panel C</strong> of Figure 04.2-1 is clearly <em>more</em> than 1 large box in duration (<em>We estimate the PR interval in Panel C to be ~0.26 second</em>).</p><ul><li>We prefer <em>not</em> to use the term, <em><strong>“borderline 1st degree”</strong></em> — since all this really says, is that you <em>almost</em> have a finding that <em>even if present</em> would <em>not</em> be clinically important. Instead, <em>our</em> preference is to say the PR interval is either normal (≤<em>0.21 second</em>) or long (><em>0.21 second</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Precise</em> determination</strong> of a PR interval that falls within the normal range is <em>not</em> necessary. Clinically — it <em>does not matter</em> IF the PR is 0.16, 0.17 or for that matter 0.19 second. Instead, it suffices to simply say —* “the PR interval is normal&rdquo;*.</li><li><strong><em>Norms for</em> children</strong> for the PR and QRS intervals are slightly different — because the pediatric heart is smaller than the adult heart. Specific normal limits for the various intervals are age-dependent. For example — a PR interval of 0.18 second may be prolonged for a <em>young</em> child, whereas it would be normal for a young adult. For the purposes of this ePub — it suffices to be aware that interval duration may differ slightly because of the smaller heart of a younger patient.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>04.4 – Memory Aid: <em>How to Recall the 3 ECG Intervals</em></strong></p><p>An easy way to recall the <em>upper</em> limits of normal for the 3 ECG intervals is simply to <em>think of</em> the <em><strong>numbers</strong></em> “<strong>1</strong>” and “<strong>2</strong>” :</p><ul><li>The <strong>PR interval</strong> is <strong>long</strong> (<em>in adults</em>) — IF it is clearly <em>more</em> than “<strong>1</strong>” <em>large</em> box (><em>0.20-0.21 second in duration</em>).</li><li>The <strong>QRS</strong> is <strong>long</strong> — IF it measures <em>more</em> than “<strong>1/2</strong>” a <em>large</em> box (><em>0.10 second in duration</em>).</li><li>The <strong>QT interval</strong> is <strong>long</strong> — IF it comprises <em>more</em> than “<strong>1/2</strong>” the R-R interval.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.0 – Bundle Branch Block/IVCD</strong></p><p><strong>05.1 – The QRS Interval: <em>What is Normal QRS Duration?</em></strong></p><p>The*** QRS interval ***represents the time it takes for ventricular depolarization to occur. With sinus rhythm in adults — the process of ventricular activation should <strong>normally</strong> be complete in <em><strong>no more</strong></em> than <strong>0.10 second</strong>. This means that IF the QRS complex is <em>longer</em> than <strong><em>half</em> a large box</strong> in duration — that the QRS is “wide” (<strong>Figure 05.5-1</strong>):</p><p><strong>Figure 05.1-1:</strong> The <strong>QRS</strong> is <em><strong>“wide”</strong></em> — IF it measures <em>more</em> than 0.10 second (<em>which is more than half a large box in duration</em>).</p><p>**<em>Clinical <em>Notes:</em></em> QRS duration can be measured from <em>any</em> of the 12 leads of a standard ECG. <strong>Select</strong> the **lead *in which *<em><em>the <strong>QRS</strong> complex <strong>appears</strong> to be <em><strong>longest</strong></em></em>.</em></p><ul><li>Practically speaking — all that matters is whether the QRS is normal or wide. Precise measurement of QRS duration for a complex that is clearly <em>within</em> the normal range is *not *necessary. Given that 0.10 second is the <em>upper normal</em> limit for QRS duration in adults — the QRS is said to be <em><strong>“wide”</strong></em> — IF it measures <strong>more</strong> than <em><strong>half</strong></em> a **<em>large <em>box</em></em> in duration (Figure 05.1-1).</li><li>These limits for QRS interval duration do <em>not</em> hold true for children (<em>for whom lesser degrees of QRS prolongation may be abnormal</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**05.2 – IF the QRS is Wide: <em>What Next? <em>(BBB Algorithm)</em></em></p><p>IF the QRS complex is wide — We suggest that you ***STOP! ***At this point —<em><strong>Short-circuit</strong></em> your <em>usual</em> sequence. Instead of your usual <em>systematic</em> approach — We suggest the following:</p><ul><li>First** **— <em><strong>Ensure</strong></em> that the <strong>patient</strong> is <em><strong>stable!</strong></em> This is because IF the patient is unstable (<em>and the rhythm is VT</em> = <em>Ventricular Tachycardia</em>) — you may need to <em>immediately</em> shock (<em>Section 02.47</em>).</li><li>But — IF the QRS is wide and the rhythm is supraventricular — the <strong><em>next</em> step</strong> in your ECG interpretation approach should be to proceed according to the <em><strong>Algorithm</strong></em> shown in <strong>Figure 05.2-1</strong>:</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.2-1:</strong> Algorithm — for how to proceed IF the rhythm is supraventricular (ie*, not WPW or VT*) and the QRS is wide. You should be able to determine the type of conduction defect in <em>no more</em> than a few seconds (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> — IF the QRS is Wide and the rhythm is supraventricular (ie, <em>sinus, AV nodal</em>) — then <strong>determine <em>WHY</em></strong> the QRS is <strong>wide</strong> <em>before</em> proceeding further with your interpretation. Practically speaking (<em>and assuming we are not dealing with VT or WPW</em>) — there are <em>only</em> <strong>3 reasons</strong> for QRS widening with sinus rhythm:</p><ul><li>There is <strong><em>typical</em> RBBB (<em>R</em></strong><em>ight <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>undle <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>ranch <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>lock</em>).</li><li>There is <strong><em>typical</em> LBBB (<em>L</em></strong><em>eft <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>undle <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>ranch <strong><strong>B</strong></strong>lock</em>).</li><li>The QRS is wide but <em>neither</em> typical RBBB <em>nor</em> typical LBBB is present. In this case, the reason the QRS is wide will be <strong>IVCD (<em>I</em><em><strong>ntra</strong></em><em>V</em><em><strong>entricular <strong><strong>C</strong></strong>onduction <strong><strong>D</strong></strong>elay</strong></em>).</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p>The “good news” (<em>as discussed on the next few pages</em>) — is that use of the <strong>Algorithm</strong> in Figure 05.2-1 allows <strong><em>accurate</em> diagnosis</strong> of the type of conduction defect (<em>BBB or IVCD</em>) in <em><strong>less</strong></em> than <strong>5 seconds</strong>!</p><ul><li>The reason we can <em>accurately</em> diagnose the type of conduction defect so quickly — is that: <strong>i)</strong> There are <em>only</em> 3 possible answers (<em>typical RBBB; typical LBBB; <em>or</em> IVCD</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> We <strong><em>only</em> need</strong> to look at <strong>3 leads</strong> to make the diagnosis. <strong>NOTE:</strong> With experience — You’ll look at <em>all</em> 12 leads for finer aspects of ECG interpretation. But <em>only</em> 3 leads are needed to diagnose the <em>type</em> of conduction defect.</li><li>The <strong>3 <em>KEY</em> leads</strong> (<em>and the only 3 leads needed</em>) to determine the <em>type</em> of conduction defect (<em>RBBB, LBBB, <em>or</em> IVCD</em>) — are <strong>leads I, V1,</strong> and** V6**. NOTE: We key in on <strong>2 <em>left-sided</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I,V6</em>) — and <strong>1 <em>right-sided</em> lead</strong> (<em>lead V1</em>) when using Figure 05.2-1 to diagnose the <em>type</em> of conduction defect:</li><li><strong>Remember</strong> — Use of the algorithm in Fig. 05.2-1 implies that the rhythm is supraventricular (<em>and not VT or WPW</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.3 – FIGURE 05.3-1: <em>Why the Need for the BBB Algorithm?</em></strong></p><p>The reason you want to recognize conduction defects <em>before</em> you get too far in the interpretation process — is that criteria for axis, LVH, RVH, ischemia and infarction are <em>all different</em> when there is BBB or IVCD! Consider the example in <strong>Figure 05.3-1</strong>, obtained from a hemodynamically stable patient with a history of heart failure:</p><ul><li>Has this patient had an <em>anterior</em> MI (<em>slanted red arrows</em>) at some point in the past?</li><li>Is there <em>ongoing</em> lateral ischemia (<em>red circle</em>) in lead V6?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.3-1:</strong> 12-lead ECG obtained from a stable patient with a history of heart failure.

Is there <em>lateral</em> ischemia (<em>red circle in lead V6</em>)?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 05.3-1:</strong> The patient is hemodynamically stable. The rhythm is sinus (<em>vertical arrow in the lead II insert</em>) — and the QRS complex is wide. Thus, although one might be tempted to call <em>anterior</em> MI (<em>slanted arrows in V1,V2,V3</em>) and ongoing ischemia (<em>red circle in lead V6</em>) — the Algorithm in Figure 05.2-1 advises us to first <em><strong>STOP</strong></em> and diagnose <strong><em>WHY</em> the QRS is wide (?)</strong> <em>before</em> proceeding further.</p><ul><li>As we will discuss momentarily — the reason for QRS widening in Figure 05.3-1 is <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong> (<em>See Section 05.6</em>). As a result — the deep <em>anterior</em> QS complexes and <em>lateral</em> ST-T wave changes are simply expected consequences of LBBB and <em>not</em> indicative of prior infarction or ischemia.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Had we <em>not</em> STOPPED at an <em>early</em> point in the interpretation process to assess the reason for QRS widening — we would have spent <em>needless</em> time thinking the patient had potentially active ischemia/infarction — when in reality there is <em>no</em> evidence of acute change on this ECG.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.4 – <em>Typical</em> RBBB: <em>Criteria for ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>The 12-lead appearance of typical <em>complete</em> RBBB in the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads (<em>leads I,V1,V6</em>) is schematically shown in <strong>Figure 05.4-1</strong>. ECG criteria for diagnosis of <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>QRS widening</strong> to *at least *<strong>0.11 second</strong>.</li><li>An <strong>rSR&rsquo;</strong> or <strong>rsR&rsquo;</strong> in <em>right-sided</em>** lead V1**.</li><li>A <strong><em>wide</em> terminal S wave</strong> in <strong>lead I</strong> and** lead V6**. The QRS complex is usually predominantly positive in these <em>left-sided</em> leads with RBBB. There may or may not be an initial small q wave. The <em>KEY</em> to <em>confirming</em> the diagnosis of RBBB is the <em>wide terminal S wave</em> in leads V1,V6 (Figure 05.4-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.4-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG of <em>typical</em> <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> in the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads. Note the rsR’ in lead V1 and wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6. <strong><em>Memory</em> Aid</strong> — <em>Think of <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>BBB and the &ldquo;<strong><strong>R</strong></strong>&rsquo;s&rdquo;</em> — in that there is an <strong>r</strong>S<strong>R&rsquo;</strong> complex with a* taller <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>ight <strong><strong>r</strong></strong>abbit ear* (the R’) in a <em><strong>R</strong></em><em>ight-sided</em> lead (= <em>lead V1</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Example of <em>Complete</em> RBBB:</strong> We illustrate application of the criteria for diagnosis of <em>complete</em> RBBB by our <em>sequential</em> approach to the 12-lead ECG shown in <strong>Figure 05.4-2</strong>:</p><ul><li>The rhythm in this ECG is <strong><em>sinus</em> tachycardia</strong> at a rate just over 100/minute (<em>arrow in lead II indicating upright sinus P wave</em>).</li><li>The <strong>QRS</strong> complex is <strong>wide</strong> (≥<em>0.11 second</em>). QRS duration is best assessed from a lead where the QRS is well defined and its duration appears to be longest. Despite seemingly normal QRS duration in several leads on this tracing (<em>leads aVL,V3,V4</em>) — there is <em>little</em> doubt that the QRS is clearly <em>more</em> than half a large box in duration in lead V1.</li><li>Identification of a sinus rhythm <em>with</em> QRS widening is indication to <em><strong>STOP</strong></em> our systematic approach and branch to the <strong>Algorithm</strong> in <strong>Figure 05.2-1</strong>. We focus on the <strong>3 <em>KEY</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I,V1,V6</em>). As shown in the inserts in Figure 05.4-2 — <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> is diagnosed by the <strong><em>typical</em> rSR’</strong> in V1 (<em>with taller right rabbit ear</em>) and the <strong>wide <em>terminal</em> S wave</strong> in leads I,V6.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.4-2:</strong> 12-lead ECG showing <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>05.5 – RBBB: <em>Clinical Notes</em></strong></p><p>The <em>upper normal</em> limit for QRS duration in adults is <strong>0.10 second</strong> (<em>half of a large box</em>). Anything <em>more</em> than 0.10 second is long (<em>Section 05.1</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Complete</em> RBBB</strong> may occur with a <strong>QRS</strong> of <strong>0.11 second</strong>. This <em>differs</em> from the situation for LBBB — for which the QRS must attain ≥0.12 second (<em>Section 05.6</em>). The RV (<em>Right Ventricle</em>) is much *thinner *than the LV — so RBBB may be <em>“complete”</em> with a QRS complex that is <em>not</em> as wide as it needs to be when there is <em>complete</em> LBBB (*conduction through nonspecialized myocardial fibers in the blocked right ventricle may be complete within 0.11 second *— <em>whereas it will take <em>≥</em>0.12 second to get through the thicker LV when there is LBBB</em>).</li><li>An <strong><em>incomplete</em> RBBB</strong> is said to be present — IF QRS morphology is typical in leads I,V1,V6 — but the QRS is <em>not</em> prolonged to at least 0.11 second (<em>See Section 05.18</em>).</li><li>RBBB is a*** terminal <em>delay</em>*. It does <em>not</em> affect the initial part of ventricular activation (<em>during which time the septum is activated <em>and</em> during which time Q waves are written</em>). As a result — <strong>Q waves</strong> may still be written <em>despite</em> RBBB. This differs from LBBB — which alters septal and initial vector activation (<em>thereby hiding most Q waves!</em> — <em>See Sections 05.7, 05.8</em>). Note that <em>despite</em> the <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> present in Figure 05.4-2 — <strong><em>inferior</em> Q waves</strong> (<em>in leads II,III,aVF</em>) are still seen (<em>which may be indicative of inferior infarction of uncertain age</em>).</li><li>The <strong><em>terminal</em> delay</strong> of <strong>RBBB</strong> may account for the fact that: <strong>i)</strong> the R’ in V1 may be quite tall (<em>the LV has already depolarized — so the small RV is unopposed as it depolarizes</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> the terminal S wave in leads V1,V6 is wide (<em>conduction through the blocked RV is slow due to the RBBB</em>).</li><li><strong>RBBB</strong> is a <strong>relatively <em>common</em></strong> conduction defect that is <em>not</em> necessarily associated with underlying pathology (<em>especially if seen in an otherwise healthy adult with a normal physical exam and no history of heart disease</em>). IF doubt exists about possible <em>underlying</em> heart disease — an <strong>Echo</strong> could be obtained (<em>though an Echo is not necessarily needed on a routine basis</em>). In contrast — <em>new</em> RBBB in a patient with <em>acute</em> MI is clearly cause for concern (<em>suggests a larger infarct and more worrisome course</em>).</li><li>In contrast to <strong>RBBB</strong> (<em>which may be a relatively benign finding in otherwise healthy adults</em>) — the finding of <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong> is <em>almost always</em> associated with some significant <em>underlying</em> cardiac pathology.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.6 – <em>Typical</em> LBBB: <em>Criteria for ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>The 12-lead appearance of typical <em>complete</em> LBBB in the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads (<em>leads I,V1,V6</em>) is schematically shown in <strong>Figure 05.6-1</strong>.

NOTE: — there should <em>never</em> normally be a Q wave in a <em>left-sided</em> lead (<em>lead I,V6</em>) with <em>typical</em> LBBB <em>unless</em> there has been <em>prior</em> infarction (<em>Section 05.28</em>).</p><p>**05.7 – FIGURE 05.7-1: *LBBB alters Septal Activation ***</p><p>Normally — the very first part of the ventricles to depolarize (<em>after the impulse passes through the AV node and Bundle of His</em>) — is the <strong><em>left</em> side</strong> of the <strong><em>ventricular</em> septum</strong>. As a result — septal depolarization <strong><em>normally</em> moves</strong> from <em><strong>left-to-right</strong></em> (<em>arrow pointing left-to-right in</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 05.7-1).</p><ul><li>Since the <strong>RBB</strong> (<em>Right Bundle Branch</em>) travels down the <em>right</em> side of the septum — this initial <em><strong>left-to-right</strong></em> direction of septal depolarization does <em>not</em> change when there is <strong>RBBB</strong> because the <em>left</em> side of the septum <em>remains intact</em> and still initiates septal depolarization (<strong>Panel B</strong>).</li><li>In contrast, with <strong>LBBB</strong> — the normal <em>left-to-right</em> direction of septal activation will change. This is because the block with LBBB <em>prevents</em> the initial vector of septal activation from starting on the left (<strong>Panel C</strong>). As a result — ventricular activation with <strong>LBBB</strong> moves almost entirely from <em><strong>right-to-left</strong></em>. Thus, the <em>initial</em> part of the QRS complex (<em>during which time Q waves are written</em>) is altered by LBBB that <em>changes</em> the direction of septal depolarization.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.7-1:</strong> Sequence of <strong><em>normal</em> septal activation</strong> — in which there is <em>left-to-right</em> septal depolarization (<em>arrow in</em> Panel A).

IF a Q wave (<em>even a small one</em>) is seen in a <em>lateral</em> lead (<em>I, aVL or V6</em>) in a patient with LBBB — that patient has had a <em>prior</em> infarction.</li><li>Following <strong><em>right-to-left</em> septal activation</strong> (<em>arrow in</em> <strong>Panel C</strong> <em>of</em> Figure 05.7-1) — ventricular activation continues to the <em>left</em> and <em>posteriorly</em>, as the large LV is depolarized.

There may or may not be a notch = RR’ in leads I,V6 (<strong>Figure 05.6-1</strong>).</li><li>*Right-to-left *septal activation, followed by continued leftward depolarization (<em>as the rest of the LV is activated</em>) — results in a predominantly <em>negative <em>complex (<em>QS or rS</em>) in <em>right-sided</em> lead V1 with LBBB.

We focus on the <strong>3 <em>KEY</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I,V1,V6</em>). As shown in the inserts in Figure 05.8-1 — <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong> is diagnosed by the predominantly <strong><em>negative</em> QRS</strong> complex in <strong>lead V1</strong> and the monophasic <strong><em>upright</em> R wave</strong> in <strong>leads I</strong> and <strong>V6</strong>.</li><li>Note that the R wave is <em>notched</em> in lead I of Fig. 05.8-1 — but <em>not</em> in lead V6. R wave notching in one or more lateral leads may or may not be seen with LBBB. No definite clinical implications are conveyed by its presence or absence.</li><li>Note also that there are <strong>QS complexes</strong> in <strong>leads V1-thru-V3</strong> and there is <strong>ST-T wave depression</strong> in several <strong><em>lateral</em> leads</strong> (<em>I,V5,V6</em>). Both of these findings are common with LBBB, and do <em>not</em> convey any information regarding possible ischemia/infarction. In addition — the slight (<em>but not marked</em>) ST elevation seen in anterior precordial leads is common and an <em>expected</em> finding with LBBB.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> We also draw attention to the QS complex seen in leads III and aVF of Figure 05.8-1. Because LBBB changes the sequence of <em>initial</em> ventricular activation (<em>during which time Q waves are written</em>) — the presence of Q waves in leads <em>other than</em> the lateral leads is <em>not</em> indicative of infarction when there is LBBB. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> All we can say about the ECG in Figure 05.8-1 is that there is <em>complete</em> LBBB. There is <em>no</em> evidence of any acute change.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.8-1:</strong> 12-lead ECG showing <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>05.9 – LBBB: <em>Clinical Notes</em></strong></p><p>The ECG finding of <strong>LBBB</strong> is virtually <em>always</em> associated with significant <strong><em>underlying</em> heart disease</strong> (ie, <em>cardiomyopathy, longstanding hypertension with LVH, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease</em>). It is rare in adults (<em>or in children</em>) to find *isolated *“benign” LBBB.</p><ul><li>The <strong>diagnosis</strong> of <strong><em>other</em> conditions</strong> (<em>ischemia, infarction, ventricular hypertrophy</em>) — will always be <strong><em>more</em> difficult</strong> when there is <strong>BBB</strong>. This is <em>especially</em> true for LBBB — which changes the <em>direction</em> of <em>initial</em> septal activation (<em>Section 05.7</em>). That said — diagnosis of <em>other</em> conditions is <em>not</em> impossible on certain occasions (<em>See Sections 05.24-through-05.32</em>).</li><li>The reason <strong><em>no</em> “septal” q wave</strong> should be seen with <strong><em>typical</em> LBBB</strong> in <em>either</em> <strong>lead I</strong> or** lead V6** — is that LBBB causes the septum to be activated from <em>right-to-left</em>. As a result — <em>left-sided</em> leads (<em>I,V6 and for that matter aVL and V5</em>) see the <em>initial</em> activation vector as coming <em>toward</em> instead of moving away from the left (<strong>Panel C</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 05.7-1). IF on the other hand, there has been **<em>septal <em>MI</em></em> — you may then see a small q wave in one or more lateral leads <em>despite</em> the LBBB.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>05.10 –</em> Incomplete <em>LBBB: <em>Does it Exist?</em></em></em></p><p>There is an entity known as*** “incomplete LBBB”***. That said — <em>incomplete</em> LBBB is very uncommon, difficult to diagnose, and usually <strong><em>not</em> clinically important</strong> to distinguish from <em>nonspecific</em> IVCD. This differs from the situation with *incomplete *RBBB which is very common and <em>easy</em> to diagnose (<em>See Section 05.18</em>).</p><ul><li>Complicating <strong>diagnosis</strong> of <strong><em>incomplete</em> LBBB</strong> is uncertainty about <em>when</em> LBBB is <em>truly</em> complete. IF for example, the QRS <em>continues</em> to widen over a period of months-to-years (<em>say, from 0.12 to 0.14 to 0.16 second</em>) — at <em>what</em> point was the LBBB “complete”? Recognition of <em>incomplete</em> LBBB is also made more difficult by the fact that <em>other</em> conditions (ie, <em>LAHB, LVH</em>) may slightly widen the QRS in a <em>similar-appearing</em> pattern.</li><li><em>Practically</em> Speaking — the diagnosis of <strong><em>incomplete</em> LBBB</strong> is really a <em>retrospective</em> one. It is only <em>over time</em> that you can know with certainty that a <em>prior</em> ECG with <em>some</em> QRS widening was in fact one stage in an <em>evolving</em> process that ultimately led to <em>more</em> QRS widening that <em>finally</em> became <em>complete</em> LBBB. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> While nice to be aware of the controversy and <em>lack</em> of consensus regarding the “definition” of <em>incomplete</em> LBBB — this diagnosis is difficult to prove and usually of <em>little</em> clinical benefit. We therefore suggest *not to worry *about trying to distinguish between <em>“incomplete LBBB”</em> vs <em>slight</em> QRS widening due to a <em>nonspecific</em> IVCD pattern.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.11 – IVCD: <em>Criteria for ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>The ECG appearance of <strong>IVCD</strong> (<em>IntraVentricular Conduction Delay <em>or</em> Defect</em>) — is difficult to characterize. This is because IVCD is often the <em><strong>end result</strong></em> of a number of <em>different</em> pathophysiologic processes — rather than a discrete defect in the conduction system (<em>as usually occurs with RBBB or LBBB</em>).</p><ul><li>Examples of conditions that may lead to IVCD include myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy with ventricular fibrosis, chamber enlargement — and/or any <em>combination</em> of these (<em>with or without an associated component of BBB</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>A <em>schematic</em> example of IVCD is shown in <strong>Figure 05.11-1</strong>.

QRS morphology is <em>not</em> typical here for either RBBB or LBBB in <em>all</em> 3 of the <em>KEY</em> leads (*leads I and V1 are consistent with RBBB *— but <em>lead V6 suggests LBBB</em>). Clearly — *many forms *of IVCD are possible in addition to the one shown here.</p><p><strong>05.12 – IVCD: <em>Clinical Notes</em></strong></p><p>The term <strong>“IVCD”</strong> is used to describe the entity in which there is sinus rhythm with QRS widening — but QRS morphology in the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads (<em>I,V1,V6</em>) is <em>not</em> typical for either RBBB or LBBB.</p><ul><li>This use of the term <strong>“IVCD”</strong> is <em><strong>“magic”</strong></em> — as it tremendously simplifies (<em>and expedites</em>) the diagnostic process. Once we <em>rule out</em> VT and WPW — We <em>know</em> QRS widening in a supraventricular rhythm will be due to <em>either</em> RBBB, LBBB or IVCD (<em>See</em> <strong>Algorithm</strong> <em>in</em> <strong>Figure 05.2-1</strong>).</li><li>IF criteria for RBBB and LBBB are <em>not</em> met (<em>in each of the 3 KEY leads</em>) — then <strong>IVCD</strong> is the reason for the wide QRS. *End of process! *We illustrate this concept in the clinical example of IVCD shown below (Figure 05.13-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p>NOTE: It will often be difficult (<em>if not impossible</em>) with IVCD to assess for LVH/RVH; <em>prior</em> MI; or <em>acute</em> ST-T wave changes.</p><ul><li>As is the case for RBBB and LBBB — the <strong><em>clinical</em> significance</strong> of <strong>IVCD</strong> depends greatly on the setting in which it occurs. Slight QRS widening (<em>of up to 0.10-to-0.11 second</em>) — is occasionally seen in otherwise <em>healthy</em> young adults (<em>in which case, this slight QRS widening of “IVCD” is most often of no clinical significance</em>).</li><li>IF doubt exists about the presence of underlying structural heart disease — an <strong>Echo</strong> could be obtained (<em>although an Echo is not necessarily needed on a routine basis</em>).</li><li>In contrast — IVCD in an older adult with chest pain or heart failure may carry similar implications as would LBBB (ie, <em>coronary artery disease, infarction, cardiomyopathy</em>). ***Clinical *correlation **<em>is everything!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p>**05.13 – FIGURE 05.13-1: <em>Clinical <em>Example of IVCD</em></em></p><p>We illustrate application of the criteria for diagnosis of IVCD by our <em>sequential</em> approach to the 12-lead ECG shown in <strong>Figure 05.13-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>The rhythm in this ECG is <strong>AFib</strong> (<em>Atrial Fibrillation</em>) — because it is <em>irregularly</em> irregular <em>without</em> P waves.</li><li>The <strong>QRS</strong> complex is <strong>wide</strong> (<em>at least 0.12 second</em>).</li><li>Identification of a supraventricular rhythm <em>with</em> QRS widening is indication to <em><strong>STOP</strong></em> our systematic approach and branch to the <strong>Algorithm</strong> in <strong>Figure 05.2-1</strong>.

This is why they produce the alterations in QRS morphology discussed in this Section. As a <em>direct</em> result of this altered sequence of activation — these conduction defects <em>also</em> alter the sequence of ventricular <em>repolarization, <em>which leads to development of <em><strong>secondary</strong></em> (2°)</em></em> ST-T wave changes (<strong>Figure 05.14-1</strong>)**.</p><ul><li>The ST-T wave changes shown in Fig. 05.14-1 are called *secondary — *because they are the direct <em>result</em> of (ie, <em>they are secondary to</em>) the conduction defect itself. That is *— *We <em>expect</em> to see this pattern of ST-T wave response shown in <strong>Figure 05.14-1</strong> as a normal part of RBBB or LBBB.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.14-1:</strong> The <em>expected</em> ST-T wave response to either <em>typical</em> RBBB or <em>typical</em> LBBB is <em><strong>“ST opposition”</strong></em>.

Once you have done so — You can refine your interpretation by looking at ST-T wave changes in the remaining leads (<em>See Section 05.15</em>).</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <em>“ST opposition”</em> rule works for RBBB and LBBB — but <em>not</em> for IVCD (<em>which is why it is often quite difficult to assess for acute changes with IVCD</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><hr><p><strong>05.15 – FIGURE 05.15-1: <em>Assessing ST-T Wave Changes with BBB</em></strong></p><p><em>Apply</em> the <strong><em>“ST opposition”</em> rule</strong> to the examples of RBBB and LBBB shown in <strong>Figure 05.15-1</strong> (*in which we reproduce the ECGs previously shown in *Figure 05.4-2 <em>and</em> Figure 05.8-1).

Focus on the <strong>3 <em>KEY</em> leads</strong> (I,V1,V6) allows <em>rapid</em> diagnosis of <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> (<em>top tracing</em>) and <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong> (<em>bottom tracing</em>). It should now take <em>no more</em> than seconds to establish that ST-T waves (<em>white arrows</em>) are <strong><em>oppositely</em> directed</strong> to the <strong><em>last</em> QRS deflection</strong> (<em>red arrows</em>) in <em>each</em> of the 3 <em>key</em> leads. Looking at this in more detail:</p><ul><li><strong><em>TOP</em> Tracing</strong> — Recognition of the rSR’ (<em>with taller right rabbit ear</em>) in V1 and wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6 define the conduction defect as <strong>RBBB</strong>. The last QRS deflection in lead V1 is upward (<em>the R’ = red arrow in V1</em>) — so the ST-T wave is <em>appropriately</em> negative (<em>white arrow</em>). Terminal S waves in leads I,V6 inscribe a downward deflection (<em>red arrows in these leads</em>) — so the T wave is <em>appropriately</em> upright in both lead I and V6 (<em>white arrows</em>).</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Tracing</strong> — Recognition of a monophasic upright R wave in left-sided leads I,V6 and a predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V1 defines the conduction defect as <strong>LBBB</strong>. The <em>only</em> QRS deflection in leads I,V6 is upward (<em>the monophasic R wave = red arrows in I,V6</em>) — so the ST-T wave is negative in these leads (<em>white arrows</em>). Lead V1 manifests a predominantly negative QRS deflection (<em>red arrow in V1</em>) — so the ST-T wave is <em>appropriately</em> upright in this lead (<em>white arrow</em>).</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Neighboring</em> leads may or may not manifest <strong>ST-T wave <em>opposition</em></strong> to the last QRS deflection. For example, there is ST-T wave opposition for <em>anterior</em> leads V2,V3 in the <em>bottom</em> tracing (<em>negative QRS with upright T wave</em>) — but <em>not</em> necessarily for all of the other leads. For this reason — Our focus in on looking at the <strong>3 <em>KEY</em> leads</strong> = leads <strong>I</strong>, <strong>V1</strong> and <strong>V6</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.16 – RBBB <em>Equivalent</em> Patterns</strong></p><p>The shape of the QRS complex in lead V1 may vary greatly with RBBB. It will <em>not</em> always show a &ldquo;neat&rdquo; rSR’ (<em>or</em> rsR&rsquo;) in this lead. Instead, <em>any</em> of the patterns shown for lead V1 in <strong>Figure 05.16-1</strong> qualify for diagnosis of <strong>RBBB</strong> — as long as the QRS complex is widened (<em>to ≥ 0.11 second</em>) — and as long as there is a wide <em>terminal</em> S wave in <em>left-sided</em> leads <em>I and V6</em>.</p><p><strong>Figure 05.16-1:</strong> RBBB <em>“Equivalent”</em> Patterns in lead V1. Despite <em>lack</em> of a <em>taller-right-rabbit-ear</em> rSR’ pattern in lead V1 — <strong>RBBB</strong> is <em>still</em> present IF: <strong>i)</strong> the QRS is wide (<em>≥ 0.11 second</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> an <em>upright</em> QRS complex <em>similar</em> to one of the patterns shown here is seen in lead V1; and** iii)** a wide <em>terminal</em> S wave is seen in lead I and lead V6.</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Points:</strong> Normally — the QRS complex in lead V1 is <em>predominantly</em> negative. This is because this <em>right-sided</em> lead (<em>V1</em>) sees electrical activity as <em>moving away</em> from V1 (<em>or toward the left ventricle</em>). The finding of predominant <em>positive</em> activity (ie, <em>a tall R wave</em>) in <em>right-sided</em> lead V1 is <em>not</em> “normal”.</p><ul><li>IF the rhythm is sinus and the QRS is wide with an **<em>“RBBB-Equivalent” <em>pattern</em></em> in <strong>lead V1</strong> — then the conduction defect is <strong>RBBB</strong> — as long as there are <strong>wide <em>terminal</em> S waves</strong> in <strong>leads I</strong> and <strong>V6</strong> (Figure 05.16-1).</li><li>Reasons why the typical triphasic (<em>rsR’; taller right rabbit ear</em>) complex in V1 may be <em>lost</em> in some patients with RBBB include scarring (<em>as may occur with cardiomyopathy</em>) and/or infarction (<em>which would be especially suggested by a qR pattern in lead V1</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.17 – FIGURE 05.17-1: <em>Is this RBBB?</em></strong></p><p>The schematic tracing in Figure 05.17-1 shows sinus rhythm and QRS widening.</p><ul><li>What <em>type</em> of BBB is seen in <strong>Figure 05.17-1</strong>?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.17-1:</strong> What <em>type</em> of conduction block is present?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 05.17-1:</strong> Lead II shows the rhythm is sinus. The QRS is wide and <em>upright</em> in lead V1 — but <em>not</em> in the usual <strong>rSR’</strong> (<em>taller right rabbit ear</em>) pattern for *typical *RBBB. Instead, the *left *rabbit ear is <em>taller</em>. This qualifies as an ***“RBBB Equivalent” ***pattern (Figure 05.16-1). Since wide terminal S waves <em>are</em> seen in the lateral leads (<em>I,V6</em>) — this tracing satisfies criteria for <strong>RBBB</strong>. ST-T wave changes <em>are</em> appropriate (<em>opposite the last QRS deflection in the 3 key leads</em>) — so there are <em>no</em> acute changes.</p><p><em><em>05.18 –</em> Incomplete <em>RBBB: <em>How is it Diagnosed?</em></em></em></p><p>As discussed in Section 05.5 — <strong>IRBBB</strong> (<em>Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block</em>) is diagnosed when QRS morphology is consistent with RBBB (<em>Section 05.4</em>) but <strong>QRS <em>duration</em></strong> is <em><strong>less</strong></em> than** 0.11 second** (Figure 05.18-1):</p><p><strong>Figure 05.18-1:</strong> ECG showing <strong>IRBBB</strong> (<em>Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block</em>) — obtained from a healthy young adult.

IF, as is seen in Figure 05.18-1 there is <em>also</em> an S wave in leads I and V6 — then we define this as <strong>“IRBBB”</strong>. If S waves are missing — We simply say, <em>“an rSr’ is present in lead V1”</em>.</li><li>Note that the ST-T wave in lead V1 of Figure 05.18-1 is inverted.

The T wave should also <em>not</em> be negative in lead V1 with <em>uncomplicated</em> LBBB.</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> We interpret <em>schematic</em> <strong>Tracing A</strong> as showing <strong>LBBB</strong> with **<em>primary <em>ST-T wave changes</em></em>. This suggests infarction has taken place at some point in the past. Clinical history and comparison with prior tracings would be needed to determine if the changes seen are new, recent or old.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Rather than “lateral” infarction — the Q wave in lead V6 indicates prior <em>septal</em> infarction. As discussed and illustrated in Section 05.7 — LBBB changes the direction of septal activation (<em>from left-to-right to right-to-left</em>). Thus, development of a Q wave in a <em>lateral</em> lead with LBBB indicates further disturbance with the process <em>septal</em> activation, presumably due to <em>septal</em> infarction.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.21 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing B</em></strong></p><p>In <em>schematic</em> <strong>Tracing B</strong> (Figure 05.21-1) — there is sinus rhythm with QRS widening.</p><ul><li>What <em>type</em> of conduction defect is present?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.21-1:</strong> <em>Practice</em> <strong>Tracing B</strong>. <em>What type of conduction defect is present?</em></p><p><strong>ANSWER to Tracing B:</strong> There is sinus rhythm with QRS widening. That said — QRS morphology is <em>not</em> consistent with either RBBB or LBBB in <em>each</em> of the 3 key leads.

This is because the <strong>ST <em>Opposition</em> Rule</strong> does <em><strong>not</strong></em> necessarily work with <strong>IVCD</strong> (<em>Section 05.14</em>). As a result — ST-T waves are <em>not</em> necessarily directed opposite to the last QRS deflection in the 3 key leads. It may therefore <em>not</em> be possible to assess for ischemia/infarction when there is IVCD (<em>unless ST-T wave changes are extreme</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.22 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing C</em></strong></p><p>There is again sinus rhythm with QRS widening in <strong>Tracing C</strong> (Figure 05.22-1).</p><ul><li>What type of BBB is present?

The QRS complex is wide in a pattern consistent with <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> (<em>Section 05.4</em>). That is — there is an rSR’ (<em>with taller right rabbit ear</em>) in lead V1 <em>with</em> wide terminal S waves in <em>both</em> leads I and V6.</p><ul><li><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> ST-T waves are <em>not</em> as expected for <em>uncomplicated</em> BBB (<em>Section 05.14</em>). That is — <strong>ST-T waves</strong> in Figure 05.22-1 are <strong><em>not</em> oppositely directed</strong> to the last QRS deflection in <em>each</em> of the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads. Instead — there is ST flattening in leads I,V1 and T wave inversion (<em>instead of an upright T wave</em>) in lead V6. Thus there are <strong><em>primary</em> ST-T wave changes</strong> on this tracing — which suggests possible recent or <em>ongoing</em> ischemia/infarction.</li><li><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> The ECG in Figure 05.22-1 — provides an excellent example of how we use the concept of <strong><em>neighboring</em> leads</strong> to refine our interpretation. Thus, the <strong>ST <em>Opposition</em> Rule</strong> (Figure 05.14-1) — allows us to quickly determine that ST-T wave depression in lead V6 is <em>not</em> normal for <em>typical</em> RBBB. We therefore should <em>not</em> expect neighboring leads (ie, <em>leads V4,V5</em>) to manifest the deep <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion that is seen in Fig. 05.14-1. This suggests that in addition to RBBB — there is a wider area of <em>lateral</em> ischemia.</li><li>Finally — there are relatively <em>larger-than-expected</em> <strong>Q waves</strong> in the <strong><em>lateral</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I, V5, V6, and especially aVL</em>). Especially in the context of RBBB and <em>primary</em> ST-T wave changes — these Q waves (<em>particularly the relatively deep Q in lead aVL</em>) may well reflect infarction of <em>uncertain</em> age.</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> — We interpret the ECG in <strong>Tracing C</strong> as showing sinus bradycardia with <em>complete</em> RBBB. There are <em>lateral</em> Q waves of <em>uncertain</em> significance and <em>primary</em> ST-T wave changes that suggest <strong>possible <em>infarction</em></strong>/<strong>ischemia</strong> of <strong><em>uncertain</em> age</strong> in* addition to *RBBB. This <em>could be</em> acute. <em>Clinical correlation</em> is needed.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The question often arises as to <em>how far over</em> in the anterior leads ST-T wave depression from RBBB may be seen? We <em>expect</em> to see ST-T wave depression in leads V1,V2 with RBBB as part of the normal secondary ST-T wave changes of BBB. This was seen in the 12-lead ECG example of <em>typical</em> RBBB shown in Figure 05.4-2. Sometimes <em>anterior</em> ST-T depression with typical RBBB may carry over as far as lead V3 — but it should usually <em>not</em> go beyond this! It should be clear that ST-T wave appearance in Figure 05.22-1 is <em>not</em> normal because: <strong>i)</strong> the ST-T wave should be upright in lead V6 (<em>as well as in leads V4,V5</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> the ST segment becomes <em>coved</em> in lead V3 — and the <em>amount</em> of T wave inversion in V3 is <em>increased</em> compared to V2 (<em>whereas with simple RBBB we would expect a decrease in amount of ST-T wave change from V2-to-V3</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.23 – PRACTICE: <em>Tracing D</em></strong></p><p>A final example of sinus rhythm with QRS widening is seen in <strong>Tracing D</strong> (Figure 05.23-1).</p><ul><li>What <em>type</em> of conduction defect is present?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.23-1:</strong> <em>Practice</em> <strong>Tracing D</strong>. *What type of conduction defect is present? *</p><p><strong>ANSWER to Tracing D:</strong> There is sinus rhythm with QRS widening.

In <strong>Figure 05.25-1</strong> — we reproduce the ST-T wave changes to look for:</p><ul><li>Normally with <strong>LBBB</strong>/<strong>RBBB</strong> — the <strong>ST-T wave</strong> will be <strong><em>oppositely</em> directed</strong> to the <strong><em>last</em> QRS deflection</strong> in the 3 <em>KEY</em> leads (<em>leads I,V1,V6</em>).</li><li>NOTE: With <strong>IVCD</strong> — the *ST opposition *rule does <em>not</em> consistently work (<em>reliability for ischemia/infarction is more limited</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.25-1:</strong> The <em>expected</em> ST-T wave response to either <em>typical</em> RBBB or <em>typical</em> LBBB is <em><strong>“ST opposition”</strong></em>.

Deviation from this pattern is abnormal <em>— <em>and indicates a <em><strong>primary</strong></em> (1°)</em></em> ST-T wave change</strong> (<em>that suggests ischemia <em>or</em> infarction</em>).</p><p><strong>05.26 – RBBB: <em>You Can See Q Waves!</em></strong></p><p>Clinically — it will usually be <em>easier</em> to diagnose ischemia/infarction when there is <em>underlying</em> <strong>RBBB</strong> than when there is LBBB. This is because RBBB does <em>not</em> alter the <em>initial</em> direction of septal depolarization as LBBB does (<em>Section 05.7</em>).</p><ul><li>As the <em>initial</em> part of the <strong>Q</strong>RS complex — <strong>Q waves</strong> are written at an <em>early</em> point during the process of ventricular activation. Because the conduction defect of <strong>RBBB</strong> does <em>not</em> alter the <em>left-to-right</em> direction of <em>normal</em> septal activation (<em>since the right bundle branch goes down the right side of the septum</em>) — the presence of RBBB will usually <em>not</em> prevent inscription of Q waves. This is in contrast to LBBB that <em>does</em> change the direction of <em>initial</em> septal activation (<em>Section 05.28</em>). <strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> Much (<em>most</em>) of the time — You <em>can</em> see infarction Q waves even when <em>complete</em> RBBB is present (Figure 05.26-1).

Perhaps artifact undulations in the baseline of lead II prevent sinus P waves from being seen or perhaps this is a <em>low atrial</em> rhythm? <em>Regardless</em> — We proceed by assessing the <em>reason</em> for QRS widening according to the <strong>Algorithm</strong> put forth at the beginning of this Section on BBB (Figure 05.2-1).</p><ul><li>A predominantly <em>upright</em> wide QR complex is seen in lead V1. This qualifies as an <em><em>RBBB</em> “equivalent” <em>pattern</em></em> (<em>Section 05.16</em>).</li><li>The diagnosis of <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> is secured by noting the presence of wide terminal S waves in <em>both</em> leads I and V6.</li><li><strong>Q waves</strong> — are seen in several leads of this tracing. The q wave in lead I is small, and of uncertain significance. However, the qrS pattern in lead aVL is distinctly abnormal and highly suggestive of lateral infarction.

Although the small amplitude upright T wave in lead I is consistent with the <strong>ST <em>opposition</em> rule</strong> (Fig. 05.25-1) — ST depression in <strong>lead V6</strong> and <em>subtle-but-real</em> ST elevation in <strong>lead V1</strong> are <em>both</em> contrary to what one normally expects with RBBB.</li><li>By the concept of <strong><em>“neighboring”</em> leads</strong> — We see similar ST depression with shallow T inversion extending from V6 to V4,V5 — and ST coving with slight elevation not only in V1, but also in V2,V3.</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> <em>Despite</em> RBBB — We are strongly suspicious of previous and perhaps recent (<em>if not acute ongoing</em>) infarction in Figure 05.27-1.

That is — IF in leads V1,V2, or V3 you can see a clear J point where the QRS ends and the ST segment begins — and — IF the J point of the ST segment is up or down >20% of QRS amplitude — then there is *excessive *discordance (<em>by the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criterion</em>). This criterion is satisfied in <strong>lead V3</strong> of <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>J-point elevation = 6; S wave depth = 24 — <em>and</em> 6/24>20%</em>). <strong>CAVEAT</strong> — it may be difficult to know where the J-point is if anterior ST elevation with LBBB is of <em>smooth</em> contour (<em>in which case you won’t be able to use this criterion</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>NOTE: Debate continues as to whether the ECG finding of <strong>LBBB</strong> of <strong><em>uncertain</em> age</strong> in a patient with *new-onset *chest pain is sufficient to justify acute cath lab activation.</p><ul><li>Most such patients do <em>not</em> have acute coronary occlusion.

Although the <em>anterior</em> precordial leads look like LBBB (<em>deep QS complexes</em>) — R wave amplitude in lead I is tiny, and there is a terminal S wave in V6. Our preference would be to call the conduction defect = <strong>“IVCD”</strong> (<em>IntraVentricular Conduction Defect</em>) — though we would accept <em>either</em> IVCD or LBBB as correct interpretations. In either case — the anterior QS complexes seen are <em>not</em> diagnostic of prior infarction given the conduction defect.</p><ul><li>Regardless of the terminology used (<em>LBBB or IVCD</em>) — the important clinical point is that interpretation of acute ischemia/infarction is more difficult in the setting of this type of conduction defect. Thus, the ST segment elevation seen in leads V1-through-V4 of Figure 05.29-3 is <em>not</em> a reliable predictor of acute anterior infarction, since LBBB <em>commonly</em> manifests anterior ST elevation comparable in shape and amount to that seen here.</li><li>On the other hand — there should <em>not</em> be <strong>ST elevation</strong> in the <em>inferior</em> leads (<strong>Figure 05.29-4</strong>). Note J-point ST elevation is present in <em>each</em> of the inferior leads (<em>red arrows in blow-up inserts of</em> Fig. 05.29-4). In support that this inferior ST elevation is real — is <em>mirror-image</em> shape <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> in <strong>lead aVL</strong> (<em>red circle</em>).

NOTE: <em>Either</em> LAA <em>or</em> the deep S wave in V1,V2,V3 <em>alone</em> would have been enough to increase likelihood of LVH.</p><p>**<em>Semantic <em>Point:</em></em> We favor use of the terminology, **<em>“probable” <em>LVH</em></em> — for the ECG picture seen in Figure 05.31-1, in which there is LBBB <em>plus</em> a <em>very</em> deep S wave in lead V2. Although statistical likelihood that this patient has LVH is <em>at least</em> 90% (<em>actually more since there is also LAA</em>) — the ECG diagnosis of “LVH” is based more on <em>prevalence</em> than on specific ECG voltage criteria. Use of the modifier <em>“probable”</em> acknowledges the uncertainties of diagnosing LVH in the presence of this conduction defect.</p><ul><li><em><strong>How Deep the S Wave?</strong></em> Note that we <em>cannot</em> tell from Figure 05.31-1 how deep the S wave in lead V3 would be — since the <em>bottom</em> of the S wave in this lead has been cut off.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Notes:</strong> Consider the following additional points:</p><ul><li>The presence of <strong>LBBB</strong> may mask and mimic other conditions. We’ve already discussed <em>special</em> considerations for assessing ischemia/infarction with LBBB (<em>Section 05.28</em>). For example — <em>despite</em> the QS complex in leads V1,V2,V3 of Figure 05.31-1 — We can <em>not</em> diagnose prior <em>anterior</em> infarction. This is because the patient has <strong><em>complete</em> LBBB</strong>. Anterior precordial QS complexes with poor R wave progression are an <em>expected</em> accompaniment of <em>complete</em> LBBB (<em>Section 05.8</em>).</li><li>In addition — We <strong>can <em>not</em> comment</strong> on the possibility of <strong>LV “strain”</strong> in the presence of LBBB. As highlighted by the ST <em>Opposition</em> Rule (<em>Section 05.25</em>) — <em>lateral</em> ST-T wave depression is an <em>expected</em> finding in LBBB. Its presence or absence says nothing about whether or not there is associated LV “strain”. Thus, even though we would interpret the ECG in Figure 05.31-1 as suggestive of <em>probable</em> LVH (<em>because of the deep S in V2 plus LAA</em>) — the ST-T depression seen in leads I,aVL,V5,V6 of this tracing is of <em>no</em> support to our interpretation. All we can say is, “LBBB with probable LVH”.</li><li>Finally — Realize that it is virtually <em>impossible</em> to <strong><em>diagnose</em> RVH</strong> when there is <strong>LBBB</strong>. The LBBB simply masks right ventricular events.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.32 – RBBB: <em>What Criteria to Use for LVH/RVH?</em></strong></p><p>ECG diagnosis of ventricular chamber enlargement is equally challenging when there is <strong>RBBB</strong>. Once again — difficulty arises because the <em>altered</em> sequence of ventricular activation leaves us <em>uncertain</em> as to how much any increase in QRS amplitude might be due to ventricular hypertrophy vs delay (<em>and therefore nonopposition</em>) of <em>right</em> ventricular depolarization forces. Realizing the imperfection inherent with <em>any</em> proposed ECG criteria for chamber enlargement when there is BBB — We make the following points:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Complete</em> RBBB</strong> is a <strong><em>terminal</em> delay</strong> (<em>Sections 05.4; 05.5</em>). As such — it does <em>not</em> affect the initial parts of ventricular activation (<em>during which time the septum and then left ventricle are activated</em>). As a result — the process of LV activation is virtually intact when there is RBBB with the exception that the larger left ventricle will <em>no longer</em> be opposed by smaller RV forces that are delayed. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> ECG <em>voltage</em> criteria for LVH in the presence of <em>complete</em> RBBB are probably <em>not</em> that different in certain leads compared to voltage criteria when there is no conduction defect.</li><li><strong><em>Suspect</em> LVH</strong> (<em>despite</em> RBBB) — IF the R wave in <strong>lead aVL</strong> is ≥12, or the R wave in <strong>lead V5</strong> or <strong>V6</strong> is ≥25.</li><li><em>Depth</em> of the S wave in leads V1,V2 is <em>no longer</em> of assistance for assessing LVH when there is RBBB — because the rSR’ in lead V1 essentially <em>precludes</em> S wave formation.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Consider the ECG in <strong>Figure 05.32-1</strong>. There is a low atrial rhythm with QRS widening consistent with <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong> (<em>rSR’ in V1; wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6</em>).</p><ul><li>Is there ECG evidence of ventricular enlargement in Figure 05.32-1?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.32-1:</strong> Low atrial rhythm with <strong><em>complete</em> RBBB</strong>. Is there ECG evidence of ventricular enlargement? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 05:32-1:</strong> ECG criteria for the diagnosis of LVH are covered in detail in Sections 08.1-through-0.8.13. S wave depth typically increases in leads V1,V2 with LVH — reflecting an increase in LV forces moving <em>away</em> from these <em>right-sided</em> leads. That said — the presence of <em>complete</em> RBBB in Figure 05.32-1 <em>negates</em> formation of S waves in leads V1,V2. <em>Other</em> leads must therefore be used to assess the possibility of LVH.</p><ul><li>R wave amplitude is <em>not</em> increased in leads V5,V6 of Figure 05.32-1.</li><li>On the other hand — the R wave in lead aVL <em>does</em> attain <em>at least</em> 12mm in height, and therefore satisfies criteria for <strong><em>probable</em> LVH</strong> in this patient with RBBB.</li><li>NOTE: We qualify our assessment in Figure 05.32-1 with the term, <strong><em>“probable”</em> LVH</strong> — to acknowledge <em>reduced</em> specificity of voltage criteria for LVH in the presence of <em>complete</em> RBBB. We simply don’t know how much of the increase in R wave amplitude in aVL is due to anatomic LV enlargement vs <em>nonopposition</em> of LV depolarization forces due to the conduction defect.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Is there RVH in Figure 05.32-1?</strong> By definition — ECG diagnosis of RVH in the presence of RBBB is problematic. This is because the presence of this conduction defect totally <em>changes</em> the sequence and nature of RV depolarization. RV depolarization with RBBB is <em>delayed</em> and <em>unopposed</em> by LV depolarization that will usually be complete by the time the activation wavefront finally makes its way into the right ventricle. As a result — the tiny right ventricle may sometimes generate a surprisingly <em>tall</em> R’ deflection in lead V1 (<em>because there no longer is opposition from LV forces</em>). <strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> The height of the R’ deflection in lead V1 with complete RBBB is <em>not</em> necessarily related to the size/thickness of the right ventricle.</p><ul><li>Realize that <em>some</em> electrocardiographers cite R’ amplitude of >10mm (<em>or >15mm</em>) in lead V1 as a criterion for diagnosing RVH in the presence of RBBB. We are <em>not</em> in favor of this practice — because it will result in false positive diagnosis of RVH in many cases.</li><li><strong><em>Our</em> Preference</strong> — is to <strong><em>undercall</em> RVH</strong> in the presence of <strong>RBBB</strong>. We generally do <em>not</em> indicate <em>“probable RVH”</em> in the setting of RBBB <em>unless</em> in addition to a very tall R’ component in lead V1 (<em>of >10-15mm</em>) — there is <em>also</em> RAA (<em>Right Atrial Abnormality</em>) in a patient <em>known</em> to have longstanding pulmonary disease. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> While we acknowledge that some interpreters may say RVH is present in Figure 05.32-1 because of the tall R’ component in lead V1 — We would <em>not</em> do so because: <strong>i)</strong> <em>No</em> history of pulmonary disease is given; and <strong>ii)</strong> there is <em>no</em> sign of RAA.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.33 – <em>Brugada</em> Syndrome</strong></p><p>First described in 1992 — the **<em>Brugada <em>Syndrome</em></em> is important to recognize because of an associated very <strong><em>high</em> risk</strong> of <strong><em>sudden</em> death</strong> in otherwise healthy young or middle-aged adults who have structurally normal hearts.</p><ul><li>The prevalence of Brugada Syndrome in the general population is ~1/2,000. The syndrome has become a leading cause of sudden death in young adults (<em>under 40 years of age</em>).</li><li>Given heightened awareness and recent <em>increased</em> attention directed toward early recognition — We suspect the estimated prevalence for Brugada syndrome will continue to increase in the years-to-come.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**05.34 – ECG Recognition: *Distinction Between Type I and II ***</p><p>Distinction is made between 2 types of Brugada ECG patterns:</p><ul><li><strong>Type I</strong> (<em>seen in <em><strong>Panel A</strong></em> of <em>Figure 05.34-1</em></em>)** — is <em><strong>diagnostic</strong></em> of Brugada Syndrome — because it shows ≥2mm coved ST elevation with <em>sharp</em> downslope <em>plus</em> T wave inversion in ≥2 <em>anterior</em> leads. <em>This is not RBBB</em>.</li><li>**Type II (***in *<strong>Panel B)</strong> — is <strong><em>not</em> diagnostic</strong> of Brugada Syndrome — <em>unless</em> the <em>saddleback</em> anterior ST elevation with <em>positive</em> T wave (<em>seen here in leads V2,V3</em>) at some time later <em>converts</em> to a Type I tracing. Most often — this <em>concave up</em> ST elevation is due to <strong>benign <em>early</em> repolarization</strong> (<em>assuming no syncope, arrhythmia or familial history of sudden death at an early age</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.34-1:</strong> Leads V1,V2 in <strong>Panel A</strong> are <em>diagnostic</em> of Brugada Syndrome. The <em>saddleback</em> pattern in leads V2,V3 of <strong>Panel B</strong> is not.</p><p><strong>CAVEAT:</strong> Type I or Type II Brugada ECG patterns may be induced by a variety of factors. A partial list includes the following:</p><ul><li><em>Certain</em> drugs (<em>antiarrhythmics; calcium channel blockers; β-blockers; antianginals; psychotropic medications; alcohol; cocaine; other drugs</em>).</li><li>Acute febrile illness.</li><li>Variations in autonomic tone.</li><li>Hypothermia.</li><li>Electrolyte imbalance (<em>hypokalemia</em>).</li><li>Ischemia/infarction.</li><li>Cardioversion/defibrillation.</li><li>Bradycardia.</li><li><em>Repositioning</em> precordial leads (<em>recording leads V1,V2 from the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Whether clinical implications of a transient <em>induced</em> Brugada pattern (<em>Type I or Type II ECG</em>) are the same as with its spontaneous occurrence is uncertain — and probably depends on <em>associated</em> clinical parameters. Thus, <em>transient</em> induction of a Type II ECG pattern would seem <em>less</em> likely to be important if only briefly seen during acute febrile illness in an otherwise healthy young adult with negative family history. In contrast — induction of <em>longer-lasting</em> Type I ECG changes in an older patient with syncope and positive family history is unquestionably of great concern. Definitive answers regarding clinical implications have not yet been worked out for all situations — so judgment is needed in clinical decision-making.</p><p>*<em>05.35 –</em> WHAT to DO? - when a Brugada Pattern is Found? ***</p><p>The clinical question that arises is the following: <em><strong>“What to do?”</strong></em> — IF you encounter a patient with a Type I or Type II tracing?</p><ul><li>Patients found to have a <strong>Type I ECG</strong> (<em>even if asymptomatic</em>) — should probably be referred to a cardiologist. **EP (**<em>ElectroPhysiologic</em>) <strong>study</strong> is clearly indicated when there are symptoms (<em>seizure; syncope or presyncope; arrhythmia</em>) or for positive family history of sudden death at an early age (<em>below 50</em>). An <strong>ICD</strong> (<em>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</em>) is indicated IF the patient has <em>inducible</em> VT (<strong>Figure 05.35-1</strong>).</li><li>Follow-up with a <em>knowledgeable</em> primary care clinician (<em>but without necessarily referring to cardiology</em>) may be appropriate — IF a <em>non-diagnostic</em> pattern is seen in an otherwise healthy adult with normal exam and <em>negative</em> family history (<strong>Figure 05.35-2</strong>).</li><li><em><strong>IF in doubt</strong></em> about <em>What to Do?</em> for a patient you encounter who has a <em>Brugada-type</em> ECG — it is prudent to err on the side of caution. This entails consulting a clinician <em>experienced</em> in diagnosis and management of Brugada syndrome, its variants and its mimics.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.35-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a young adult with syncope. Even without a positive family history for sudden death at an early age — the <strong>Type I <em>Brugada</em> pattern</strong> seen here in leads V1,V2 is enough to justify <em>prompt</em> referral to an EP (<em>ElectroPhysiology</em>) cardiologist for consideration of ICD placement. Note J-point ST elevation of 2-3mm in lead V1 and more than 5mm in V2 — followed by convincingly <em>steep</em> ST downslope into <em>inverted</em> T waves (<em>comparable to</em> Panel A <em>in</em> Fig. 05.34-1). This <strong>ECG</strong> is <em><strong>diagnostic</strong></em> for <strong><em>Brugada</em> Syndrome</strong>.</p><p><strong>Figure 05.35-2:</strong> ECG obtained from an <em>asymptomatic</em> young adult. An rSr’ pattern is seen in lead V1 with <em>saddleback</em> ST elevation in lead V2. This ECG is consistent with a <strong>Type II Brugada pattern</strong>. Although more than is usually seen with simple <em>incomplete</em> RBBB or early repolarization — the ECG pattern in this figure is <strong><em>not</em> diagnostic</strong> of Brugada syndrome. Referral and ICD placement are <em>not</em> necessarily needed — especially if this asymptomatic young adult has a <em>negative</em> family history. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Judgment and clinical correlation are needed for optimal evaluation and management. <em>Not all answers are yet in</em>. Each case should be individualized (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>05.36 – WPW (<em>Wolff-Parkinson-White</em>)</strong></p><p>In the setting of normal sinus rhythm — the <em>only</em> exception to the <em>simplified</em> <strong>Algorithm</strong> for assessment of <em><strong>QRS Widening</strong></em> (<em>Section 05.2</em>) — is the <em><strong>W</strong></em><em>olff-<strong><strong>P</strong></strong>arkinson-<strong><strong>W</strong></strong>hite</em> (<em>WPW</em>) <strong>Syndrome</strong>.</p><ul><li>Although admittedly uncommon (<em>~2 per 1,000 in the general population</em>) — WPW occurs just often enough to cause problems for the unwary. The <em><strong>importance</strong></em> of <strong>WPW</strong> is twofold: <strong>i)</strong> It is <em><strong>“the great mimic”</strong></em> — and may simulate other conditions (<em>such as ischemia/infarction, hypertrophy and/or conduction defects</em>) — IF it is <em>not</em> recognized; and <strong>ii)</strong> The presence of one or more accessory pathways <em><strong>predisposes</strong></em> the patient to a number of potentially important <strong><em>cardiac</em> arrhythmias</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.37 – WPW: <em>Pathophysiology / ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>WPW — is a syndrome in which one or more <em>accessory</em> pathways exist that allow an <em>alternate</em> route for transmission of the electrical impulse from atria to ventricles. Thus, with <strong>WPW</strong> — sinus impulses <em><strong>bypass</strong></em> the AV node via an <strong>AP</strong> (<em><strong>A</strong></em><em>ccessory <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>athway</em>) — and therefore arrive <em>early</em> in the ventricles (<strong>Panel A</strong>* in *Figure 05.37-1).</p><p><strong>Figure 05.37-1:</strong> With WPW — impulses <em>bypass</em> the AV node via AP conduction. Although the <strong>AP</strong> shown in <strong>Panel A</strong> is <em><strong>right-sided</strong></em> — it could be left-sided, anterior or posterior and at times there is <em>more</em> than a single AP. The <strong>3 ECG signs</strong> of <strong>WPW</strong> are seen in <strong>Panel B</strong> — <strong>i)</strong> a <strong><em>delta</em> wave</strong> (<em>which may be positive or negative</em>); <strong>ii) QRS widening</strong>; and <strong>iii)</strong> a <strong><em>short</em> PR interval</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>ECG Recognition of WPW:</strong> It is usually easy to recognize WPW on a baseline 12-lead ECG when conduction <em>completely</em> utilizes the <strong>AP</strong> (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>). There are <strong>3 ECG features</strong> to look for (<strong>Panel B</strong>* in *Figure 05.37-1):</p><ul><li><em>Delta</em> waves.</li><li>A <em>short</em> PR interval.</li><li>QRS widening.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Delta</em> Wave:</strong> The <strong><em>delta</em> wave</strong> is recognized as a distortion of the <em>initial</em> portion of the QRS complex. It is due to the fact that the electrical impulse <em>bypasses</em> the AV node — and arrives at the ventricles <em>directly</em> via conduction over the accessory pathway.</p><ul><li>Delta waves may be upright (<em>positive</em>) or downward (<em>negative</em>) — depending on where in the heart the AP is located. When delta waves are negative — they may simulate the Q wave of myocardial infarction (Panel B* in *Fig. 05.37-1):</li><li>Even when conduction is entirely over the AP — delta waves will <em>not</em> always be seen in every lead. Moreover, delta waves may come and go — since conduction over the AP may be intermittent. At times — conduction may <em>simultaneously</em> occur over both the normal and accessory pathway. When this happens — the ECG characteristics of WPW may be subtle because the contribution from conduction over the normal AV nodal pathway may predominate (<em>and thereby mask</em>) ECG features of pre-excitation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Short</em> PR Interval:</strong> The reason the <strong>PR interval</strong> is <em><strong>short</strong></em> with WPW — is that the AV node is bypassed. With normal conduction in sinus rhythm — the electrical impulse <em>slows down</em> as it passes through the AV node on its way to the ventricles. As a result — most of the PR interval normally consists of the time it takes for the impulse to traverse the AV node. The electrical impulse arrives at the ventricles <em>sooner</em> with WPW because the usual relative <em>delay</em> that occurs when passing through the AV node is <em>avoided</em> by conduction over the AP.</p><p><strong>QRS Widening:</strong> The <strong>QRS <em>widens</em></strong> with <strong>WPW</strong> — because <em>after</em> the impulse arrives at the ventricles (<em>via conduction over the AP</em>) — it must travel over <em>nonspecialized</em> myocardial tissue until such time that it attains whatever distal portion of the conduction system that has <em>not</em> yet depolarized. Thus the delta wave may extend for 0.04 second or more (<em>reflecting slow conduction over nonspecialized myocardial tissue</em>). When the delta wave deflection is <em>added</em> to the rest of the QRS complex — the result is a <em>widened</em> complex.</p><p><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line <em>Regarding</em> ECG Recognition:</strong> Many variations exist on the above theme. Remember the following:</p><ul><li>WPW is <em>not</em> common in the general population — but it <em>does</em> occur (<em>and you will see it</em>)!</li><li>When a patient with WPW is conducting over their accessory pathway — you can <strong><em>diagnose</em> WPW</strong> by <em><strong>recognition</strong></em> of the following <strong>3 ECG features</strong> in at least <em>several</em> of the 12 leads of an ECG: <strong>i)</strong> QRS widening; <strong>ii)</strong> a <em>delta</em> wave; and iii) a <em>short</em> PR interval.</li><li><strong>Preexcitation</strong> (ie, <em>WPW conduction over an AP</em>) can be intermittent. There may be no indication on ECG that a patient has WPW if conduction is entirely (<em>or almost entirely</em>) over the normal AV nodal pathway at the time the tracing is recorded.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.38 – WPW: <em>The “Great Mimic” of other Conditions</em></strong></p><p>As already emphasized — an essential reason for recognizing WPW is so that it is <em>not</em> confused with <em>other</em> conditions. This point is well illustrated by the <em>schematic</em> tracing shown in <strong>Figure 05.38-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>Note in Fig. 05.38-1 — that <em>delta</em> waves are <em>not</em> always present in all leads. For example, they are completely <em>missing</em> in leads I,aVL and V4,V5 of Figure 05.38-1.</li><li><em>Negative</em> delta waves are present in leads II,III,aVF and <em>simulate</em> inferior infarction.</li><li>The tall R wave in lead V1 <em>simulates</em> RBBB.</li><li>The tall, monophasic R wave in lead V6 <em>simulates</em> LBBB.</li><li>ST-T wave depression in lead V6 <em>simulates</em> ischemia.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> It is <em>easy</em> to <em>overlook</em> WPW if one does not <em>routinely</em> use a <em>Systematic</em> Approach. This is especially true IF — conduction goes down <em>both</em> the AP and the normal AV nodal pathway at the <em>same</em> time (<em>in which case the delta wave may be subtle</em> and <em>the QRS may be no more than minimally widened</em>).</p><p><strong>Figure 05.38-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> example of <strong>WPW</strong>. Known as <strong>the <em>great</em> “mimic”</strong> — the ECG picture of WPW may resemble infarction, ischemia, chamber enlargement *and/or *bundle branch block — as it does here (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>**05.39 – FIGURE 05.39-1: *Recognizing WPW on a 12-Lead ***</p><p>Primary care care and emergency clinicians will <em>not</em> always have the luxury of a baseline 12-lead ECG at the time a patient with <em>WPW-associated</em> tachycardia is initially seen. However, with luck — a <strong><em>baseline</em> 12-lead ECG</strong> with <strong><em>telltale</em> features</strong> of <strong>WPW</strong> may occasionally be found in the patient’s chart — thereby <em>confirming</em> the diagnosis. We show such a tracing with <strong><em>overt</em> WPW</strong> in <strong>Figure 05-39-1</strong>. Note the following:</p><ul><li>Suggestion of <strong>WPW</strong> is readily apparent from initial inspection of <strong>lead II</strong> — in which all 3 ECG features are seen: <strong>i)</strong> short PR interval;** ii)** <em>delta</em> wave (<em>red arrow</em>); and QRS widening.

The negative delta wave in lead aVL may simulate high lateral infarction.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Delta waves are <em>not</em> prominent in every lead. The delta wave is subtle in leads I and V2 — and completely <em>absent</em> in lead V1. The QRS complex does <em>not</em> appear wide in these leads. Depending on the <em>relative</em> contribution from normal AV nodal pathway conduction and AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>) conduction — more or less leads may manifest delta waves, and the QRS complex may be obviously wide or only minimally prolonged.</li><li>Clinically — One can* not* diagnose LVH, ischemia or infarction from the ECG shown in Figure 05.39-1 — <em>despite</em> the tall inferior R waves, deep Q wave in lead aVL, and ST-T wave changes in V1,V2,V3 — since the patient has WPW.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> It should be apparent from Figure 05.39-1 that the diagnosis of WPW could be <em>easily</em> overlooked IF one was not systematic in their approach. At <em>first</em> glance — the QRS complex does <em>not</em> look overly wide. That said — there is no mistaking the <strong>lead II</strong> findings of a <strong><em>short</em> PR interval</strong> with <strong>upward <em>delta</em> wave</strong> (<em>red arrow</em>) — that when <em>added</em> to the remaining portion of the QRS results in <strong>QRS widening</strong>. Confirmation of WPW is forthcoming from recognition of delta waves in most (<em>but not all</em>) of the <em>other</em> leads on the tracing.</p><p><strong>Figure 05.39-1:</strong> 12-lead ECG showing sinus rhythm with WPW. Note the short PR, delta wave and QRS widening in <strong>lead II</strong> (<em>red arrow</em>). Delta waves are <em>negative</em> in leads aVR and aVL (<em>blue arrows</em>).

In addition — it helps in planning the procedure as well as in patient discussion, since risks of catheter ablation and likely success rates are based in part on localization of the AP.</p><ul><li>We emphasize that ECG localization of the AP is an <strong><em>advanced</em> topic</strong> that clearly extends beyond clinical needs of the non-EP-cardiologist. Practically speaking — it suffices to recognize WPW and IF there is need for referral.

The <em>same</em> 3 possibilities for conduction exist when a patient with WPW develops a <strong><em>supraventricular</em> tachyarrhythmia</strong>. In these next few sections — we briefly review key points to consider when the patient with WPW develops an SVT (<em>SupraVentricular Tachycardia</em>).</p><ul><li>Patients with WPW are prone to SVT rhythms in which a <strong><em>reentry</em> circuit</strong> is set up between the normal AV nodal pathway and the AP. Assuming there is no preexisting bundle branch block — whether or not the QRS complex will be wide <em>during</em> the tachycardia in a patient with WPW will depend upon whether the reentrant pathway goes <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> the AP (<strong>Figure 05.47-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.47-1:</strong> SVT pathways with WPW. Conduction of the impulse from atria to ventricles during <em>WPW-associated</em> tachycardia may either be: <strong>i)</strong> as in <strong>Panel A</strong> = <strong>orthodromic</strong> (<em>down the normal AV nodal-His-Purkinje system <em>—</em> and back up the AP</em>) — as commonly occurs with PSVT; or <strong>ii)</strong> as in <strong>Panel B</strong> = <strong>antidromic</strong> (<em>first down the AP <em>—</em> and then back up the normal pathway</em>) — as commonly occurs with AFib or AFlutter — and only rarely with PSVT. Assuming there is no underlying bundle branch block — the QRS will be <em>narrow</em> with orthodromic conduction (Panel A) and <em>wide</em> with antidromic conduction (Panel B).</p><p><strong>05.48 – PSVT with WPW: <em>When the QRS During Tachycardia is Narrow</em></strong></p><p>When PSVT occurs in a patient with WPW — the tachycardia is almost always <strong>orthodromic</strong> (<em>down the normal AV nodal-His-Purkinje system — and back up the AP =</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> *in *Figure 05.47-1).</p><ul><li>Because conduction goes <em>down</em> the normal AV nodal pathway — the <strong>QRS</strong> is <em><strong>narrow</strong></em> during the tachycardia. As a result — the usual <strong>AV nodal blocking drugs</strong> (<em>Verapamil-Diltiazem-β-Blockers</em>) can be used and are usually effective.</li><li>A delta wave will <em>not</em> be seen during the tachycardia. The presence of WPW may only be suspected in a patient with <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT IF an ECG showing delta waves is found in the medical chart or obtained following conversion of the tachycardia.</li><li>PSVT is by far the most common tachyarrhythmia observed in patients with WPW. It is often well tolerated.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> A surprising number of patients with PSVT actually have one or more <em>concealed</em> accessory pathways. That is — a conduction pathway exists between atria and ventricles that <em>only</em> allows orthodromic (<em>but not antidromic</em>) conduction. Since forward conduction down the AP is not possible — a delta wave is <em>never</em> seen. However, ready availability of an AP reentry pathway may predispose such patients to frequent episodes of PSVT. While acute treatment considerations are similar to those for treatment of any other <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT — awareness of this entity may lower one’s threshold for EP referral after the episode if PSVT episodes are frequent <em>and/or</em> difficult to control with medication. Ablation of the AP may be curative.</li><li><em>Way-Beyond-the-Core:</em> Taking the last <em>advanced</em> information bullet one step further — You may at times be able to <em>suspect</em> the presence of an AP in some WPW patients with <em>narrow</em> complex PSVT even without seeing a delta wave IF you see a <em>negative</em> P wave with <em>long</em> R-P interval reflecting <em>retrograde</em> conduction back to the atria during the reentrant cycle. When retrograde conduction is seen during AVNRT in a patient <em>without</em> WPW — the RP is <em>very</em> short (<em>most often seen as a notch at the tail end of the QRS complex</em>) reflecting short distance travel <em>within</em> the AV node. The RP tends to be longer (<em>negative P usually seen midway within the ST segment</em>) for a patient in whom the reentry circuit runs down the AV node and back up an AP lying outside the AV node. Technically — this type of PSVT in a patient with accessory pathways is known as <strong>AVRT</strong> (<em>AtrioVentricular Reciprocating Tachycardia</em>). Distinction in the ECG picture <em>between</em> AVNRT vs AVRT (*when an AP is present) *is an <em>advanced</em> concept that generally does <em>not</em> impact on acute treatment. We often will simply <em>not</em> know if a <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT rhythm involves AV node vs AP in its reentry circuit.</li><li><em>Final Way-Beyond-the-Core Point:</em> Adenosine may <em>shorten</em> the refractory period of atrial tissue — which could initiate AFib in a <em>predisposed</em> individual. As a result — Adenosine should be used with caution in patients with <em>known</em> WPW, given <em>theoretic</em> possibility of inducing AFib (<em>which could have significant consequence in a patient with accessory pathways</em>). That said — we often will <em>not</em> know at the time treatment is needed IF the patient with a <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT has a <em>concealed</em> AP and even if they do, giving Adenosine to such a patient will <em>rarely</em> be problematic.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line</strong>** = <em>What to Remember!</em>**</p><p><em>Most</em> of the time — PSVT in a patient with WPW will conduct with a <em>narrow</em> QRS complex (*as in <em><strong>Panel A</strong></em> in *Figure 05.47-1).</p><ul><li>Practically speaking — you do <em>not</em> have to worry in the immediate <em>acute</em> setting IF a patient with <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT has WPW or not. Initial treatment measures are the same. These include: <strong>i)</strong> A <em>vagal</em> maneuver; and/or <strong>ii)</strong> Adenosine; and/or <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Other</em> AV nodal blocking agent (<em>Diltiazem, β-Blocker</em>).</li><li>With regard to <em>longterm</em> management — awareness that a significant percentage of patients with <em>narrow-complex</em> PSVT have a <em>concealed</em> AP (<em>even when they never show overt WPW on their ECG</em>) should <em>lower</em> our threshold for EP referral if PSVT episodes recur <em>despite</em> medical therapy.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.49 – <em>Very Rapid</em> AFib with WPW</strong></p><p>In contrast to the situation for PSVT with WPW — the occurrence of <strong>AFib</strong> in a patient with WPW <em>almost always</em> manifests a <strong><em>wide</em> QRS</strong> during the tachycardia. This is because the path of conduction for AFib with WPW is almost always <strong>antidromic</strong> (*first down the AP <em>— <em>and then back up the normal pathway =</em> <strong>Panel B</strong></em> in *Figure 05.47-1).</p><ul><li>Because of the short RP (<em>Refractory Period</em>) of the accessory pathway — there may be 1:1 conduction of atrial impulses (<em>at times resulting in a ventricular response that may exceed 250/minute!</em>). As might be anticipated — these rapid rates are <em>not</em> always well tolerated (<em>may deteriorate to VFib</em>).</li><li>It is recognition of the ECG picture of <strong><em>exceedingly</em> rapid AFib</strong> (<em>over 220/minute in parts of the tracing</em>) in conjunction with <strong>QRS widening</strong> and <strong><em>marked</em> variability</strong> in regularity of the tracing that clues the clinician into the <em>almost certain</em> diagnosis of <strong>WPW <em>with</em> very <em>rapid</em> AFib</strong>. This is the case for the rhythm in Figure 05.49-1.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 05.49-1:</strong> WPW with very <em>rapid</em> AFib. Even <em>without</em> benefit of a 12-lead ECG — an <em>almost certain</em> diagnosis of <strong>WPW</strong> can be made from this <em>single</em> rhythm strip because: <strong>i)</strong> there is QRS widening with <em>marked</em> irregular irregularity showing far <em>more</em> variation in rate than is seen with VT; and <strong>ii)</strong> parts of the rhythm show a rate <em>between</em> 250-300/minute, which is far <em>too fast</em> for AFib conduction over the normal AV nodal pathway. Thus, the rhythm <em>must be</em> AFib — and conduction must be <em>bypassing</em> the normal AV nodal pathway in a patient with WPW who has an AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Treatment</em> Considerations: <em>WPW with Very Rapid AFib</em></strong></p><p>The importance of recognizing that the example of <em>very rapid</em> AFib seen in Figure 05.49-1 is from a patient with WPW — is that treatment considerations are very <em>different</em> than they are for the much more common usual AFib patient.</p><ul><li><strong>AV Nodal <em>Blocking</em> Drugs</strong> — that are regularly used to treat the common form of rapid AFib are <em><strong>contraindicated</strong></em>. This includes Verapamil-Diltiazem-Digoxin — and <em>possibly</em> β-Blockers. By impeding conduction down the normal AV nodal pathway — <em>all</em> of these agents may inadvertently <em>facilitate</em> forward (<em>antidromic</em>) conduction of AFib impulses down the AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>), thereby <em>accelerating</em> the rapid AFib even more. This may precipitate deterioration to VFib.</li><li>Realizing that Adenosine is often used as a <em>diagnostic</em> measure during assessment of various WCT (<em>Wide-Complex Tachycardia</em>) rhythms — it is best to <strong><em>avoid</em> Adenosine</strong> whenever possible IF very rapid AFib <em>with</em> WPW is suspected (<em>since Adenosine may likewise accelerate AP conduction in a patient with WPW</em>). That said — the <em>ultra-short</em> half-life of Adenosine is much <em>less</em> likely to be deleterious compared to other AV nodal blocking drugs if it is inadvertently given.</li><li><strong>Drugs of Choice:</strong> The 3 drugs that have most commonly been recommended for antiarrhythmic treatment of <strong><em>hemodynamically</em> stable</strong> very rapid AFib (<em>or AFlutter</em>) with WPW are** i)** Procainamide; <strong>ii)</strong> Amiodarone; and <strong>iii)</strong> Ibutilide. There are pros and cons for use of each of these agents that extent beyond the scope of this ePub on ECG interpretation. Each drug has its advocates. All in theory reduce forward transmission of impulses down the accessory pathway. <strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> IF at any time during the treatment process the patient becomes <em>hemodynamically</em> unstable — then cardiovert!</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.50 – Atrial Flutter with WPW</strong></p><p>When <strong>AFlutter</strong> occurs in a patient with WPW — the tachyarrhythmia is also <strong>antidromic</strong> (*first down the AP *— <em>and then back up the normal pathway = as in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> *of *Figure 05.47-1).</p><ul><li>As with AFib — the <strong>QRS</strong> is <em><strong>wide</strong></em> in <strong>AFlutter</strong> <em>with</em> <strong>WPW</strong>. There may be 1:1 AV conduction of atrial impulses (<em>so that the ventricular response may be 250-300/minute</em>)!</li><li>Very fast AFlutter with WPW is seen even <em>less often</em> than AFib (<em>but clinical manifestations and treatment are similar</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.51 – PSVT with WPW: <em>When the QRS is Wide</em></strong></p><p>In <em>rare</em> instances — <strong>PSVT</strong> may be <em><strong>antidromic</strong></em> (ie, <em>travel first down the AP</em> — <em>and then back up the normal pathway = as occurs in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> *of *Figure 05.47-1).</p><ul><li>In these rare instances — the <strong>QRS</strong> will be <em><strong>wide</strong></em> and the PSVT rhythm may be <em>indistinguishable</em> from VT.</li><li>It may only be <em>after</em> conversion to sinus rhythm that “telltale” delta waves of WPW can be identified. Fortunately — the <em>vast</em> majority (<em>~95%</em>) of PSVT episodes with WPW are orthodromic (<em>with narrow QRS</em>). <strong><em>Synchronized</em> cardioversion</strong> will be the usual treatment of choice for episodes of a <em>regular</em> WCT (<em>Wide-Complex Tachycardia</em>) in which one suspects <em>antidromic</em> PSVT in a patient with WPW as the etiology.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>05.52 – FIGURE 05.52-1: <em>VT or WPW?

No P waves are seen in any of the 12 leads of this tracing. This defines the rhythm as <strong>AFib</strong>. That said — the <strong><em>ventricular</em> response</strong> is <strong><em>exceedingly</em> rapid</strong> (<em>attaining a rate of nearly 300/minute in some parts of the tracing</em>). In addition — there is marked <em>variability</em> in rate of the ventricular response (<em>seen best in leads aVF and V3</em>).</p><ul><li>This 12-lead ECG is <strong><em>virtually</em> diagnostic</strong> of **<em>very rapid <em>AFib</em></em> in a patient who has <strong>WPW</strong>.

Clinically — it is usually <em>not</em> a problem in an otherwise healthy adult to take any single drug that may affect the QT. But — the amount of QT prolongation (<em>and the risk of Torsades</em>) may be <em>additive</em> IF <em>more</em> than one <em>QT-lengthening</em> drug is taken — especially if circumstances or <em>other</em> condition <em>predisposing</em> to Torsades is present (<em>Section 06.4</em>).</li><li><strong>LYTES</strong> — 3 electrolyte disorders should be kept in mind when assessing a patient with QT prolongation: <strong>i) <em>Hypokalemia</em></strong> — is characterized by ST flattening/depression; development of <strong>U waves</strong>; and QT lengthening (<em>Section 11.7</em>); <strong>ii) <em>Hypomagnesemia</em></strong> — produces <em>identical</em> ECG and clinical effects as hypokalemia (<em>Section 11.8</em>); and <strong>iii) Hypocalcemia</strong> — which if other electrolytes are normal, tends to produce a <em>normal</em> T wave after a <em>prolonged</em> QT interval (<em>Section 11.1</em>).</li><li>NOTE: Rather than “QT” lengthening — it is really the <strong>“QU” interval</strong> that is prolonged with hypokalemia *and/or *hypomagnesemia (<em>as T and U waves tend to fuse as the U wave becomes bigger with more profound electrolyte depletion</em>).</li><li><strong>CNS catastrophes</strong> (ie, <em>coma, stroke, trauma, seizure, bleed</em>) — are known to produce some of the most <strong><em>bizarre</em> ST-T wave abnormalities</strong> (<em>and some of the longest QT intervals</em>).

What is the rhythm? What to do next? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 06.6-1:</strong> After 2 sinus beats — the rhythm dramatically changes. This is <strong><em>polymorphic</em> VT</strong> — as defined by constantly <em>varying</em> QRS morphology <em>throughout</em> the rest of the tracing.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Torsades de Pointes</strong></em> — is defined as <strong><em>polymorphic</em> VT</strong> that occurs in association <strong>with</strong> a <strong><em>prolonged</em> QT</strong> interval on baseline ECG. The very rapid <em>irregular</em> WCT seen in Figure 06.6-1 manifests the shifting QRS polarity around the baseline (<em>“twisting” of the points</em>) that is characteristic of Torsades.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> There appears to be a <strong><em>prolonged</em> QT interval</strong> for the first 2 sinus beats in Figure 06.6-1 (ie, <em>the QT looks to be more than half the R-R interval</em>) — in which case the rhythm would be <strong>Torsades</strong>. That said — it is difficult to be certain where the T wave (<em>and therefore the “QT” interval</em>) ends in this tracing. Clinically — It will simply <em>not</em> always be possible to assess QT duration during <em>polymorphic</em> VT.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> Reality</strong> — When we <em>either</em> do not have access to a prior <em>baseline</em> 12-lead ECG on the patient or cannot accurately assess the QT interval from the rhythm strip — we will be <em>unable</em> to distinguish whether the rhythm is <strong>PMVT</strong> (<em>PolyMorphic Ventricular Tachycardia</em>) — or <strong>“Torsades”</strong> (<em>which is simply PMVT with baseline QT prolongation</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Treatment of Figure 06.6-1:</strong> <em>Regardless</em> of whether this <em>irregular</em> WCT rhythm is PMVT or Torsades — <strong><em>initial</em> treatment measures</strong> are the same: <strong>i)</strong> Defibrillation if the rhythm persists; <strong>ii)</strong> Magnesium Sulfate (<em>1-2 gm IV — which often needs to be repeated up to 4-8 gm</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> Try to find and fix the <em>underlying</em> cause of PMVT/Torsades. Potential additional measures for resistant cases (ie, <em>overdrive pacing, isoproterenol</em>) extend beyond the scope of this ePUb on ECG diagnosis.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> There are some differences in etiology and response to treatment between Torsades vs PMVT <em>without</em> QT prolongation that are worthy of mention. While IV Magnesium Sulfate is the drug of choice for <em>both</em> disorders — PMVT tends to respond less well to this treatment than when there is Torsades <em>with</em> QT prolongation. Rather than being drug or electrolyte induced — PMVT with a <em>normal</em> QT more often has an <em>ischemic</em> etiology (<em>occasionally due to Brugada Syndrome</em>). Efforts addressed at treating acute ischemia may therefore be helpful. IV Amiodarone <em>and/or</em> β-blockers may reduce recurrence and should be considered if IV Magnesium is ineffective.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**06.7 – FIGURE 06.7-1: *Torsades vs PMVT vs Something Else? ***</p><p>Would you treat <em>both</em> of the rhythms in Figure 06.7-1 with defibrillation and IV Magnesium?</p><ul><li>What <em>additional</em> information is essential for answering this question?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 06.7-1:</strong> Torsades vs PMVT vs <em>something</em> else? (<em>See text</em>). HINT: Timelines for determining heart rate are shown by the <em>square</em> boxes in each tracing (<em>corresponding to a large box on ECG grid paper in each case</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 06.7-1:</strong> At first glance, it appears that <em>both</em> of these rhythm strips represent PMVT/Torsades.  While superficially they do — the devil is in the details (<em>in this case the <strong><strong>rate</strong></strong> of the rhythm</em>). </p><ul><li>Note in <strong>Rhythm A</strong> of Fig. 06.7-1 —** **that there are at certain points in the tracing <em>two</em> vertical deflections for each large box. This corresponds to a rate of ~500-to-600/minute, or <em>too fast</em> for Torsades. This is <strong>artifact</strong>. We do <em>not</em> see any normal beats on this tracing — but instead just see very straight line, <em>excessively</em> fast deflections suggestive of artifact.</li><li>The rate in <strong>Rhythm B</strong> is also fast — but much closer to ~300/minute (<em>~1 complex per each large box</em>) — which clearly falls within the appropriate rate range for <strong>PMVT/Torsades</strong>. The rhythm begins and ends by a few normal (<em>narrow</em>) sinus beats. Given the rapid rate — it is difficult to determine if the QT is or is not prolonged. Therefore, we can <em>not</em> be certain if <strong>Rhythm B</strong> is PMVT or technically qualifies as “Torsades”. As emphasized in Section 06.6 — initial treatment measures are the same <em>regardless</em> of whether or not there is baseline QT prolongation.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**<em>KEY <em>Point:</em></em> — Awareness of <strong><em>clinical</em> context</strong> is an essential component of <em>clinical</em> ECG interpretation. The diagnostic dilemma of whether <strong>Rhythm A</strong> in Figure 06.7-1 is “real” might be <em>easily</em> resolved IF we <em>knew</em> that the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable (<em>which would confirm artifact</em>). Loose lead connections, tremor, scratching, shivering, and seizure activity are but a few of the possible causes of <em>artifact-related</em> deflections that might simulate a tachyarrhythmia.</p><p>**06.8 – FIGURE 06.8-1: *Is the QT Long? ***</p><p>Comment on the QT interval for the 12-lead ECG shown in Figure 06.8-1. What <em>clinical</em> conditions are likely to account for findings on this ECG?</p><p><strong>Figure 06.8-1:</strong> Is the QT interval prolonged? If so — What is the likely cause(s)?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 06.8-1:</strong> The rhythm is sinus tachycardia at a rate just over 100/minute. The PR interval and QRS duration are both normal. However — the <strong>QT interval</strong> is <strong>long</strong>:</p><ul><li>As emphasized in Section 06.1 — the QT interval should be measured in a lead where you can clearly see the <em>end</em> of the T wave and in which the QT appears to be longest. As a result — a lead such as <strong>aVL</strong> should <em>not</em> be used, since the end of the T wave is <em>not</em> well defined in this lead (<em>red question mark in</em> Fig. 06.8-1).</li><li>On the other hand — it is much easier to determine the limits of the T wave in <em>other</em> leads. This is especially true for** lead V2** — in which the QT interval is obviously <em>more</em> than half the R-R interval. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Although the “eyeball method” for assessing QT interval duration is admittedly <em>less</em> accurate when heart rate exceeds 90-100/minute (<em>Section 06.2</em>) — QT duration in Figure 06.8-1 is <em>so much more</em> than half the R-R interval, that the QT is undoubtedly prolonged <em>despite</em> the fact that the heart rate is relatively rapid.</li><li>Regarding assessment of the <em>rest</em> of the ECG in Figure 06.8-1 — the most remarkable finding is <strong>deep, <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion</strong> in most precordial leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>IMPRESSION:</strong> Sinus tachycardia — <em>marked</em> QT prolongation — and diffuse <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion. In addition to ischemia (<em>which is suggested by this symmetric T wave inversion</em>) — <em>Think</em> <strong>“Drugs/Lytes/CNS”</strong> as the categories of entities to consider in your differential diagnosis for the <strong><em>markedly</em> prolonged QT interval</strong> seen here (<strong>LIST #3</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 06.2-1). Clinical correlation is <em>needed</em> to comment further on the most likely causes.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The reason we say the QT interval is <em>markedly</em> prolonged — is that the QT literally makes up <em>more</em> than 2/3 of the R-R interval (<em>See insert of leads V2,V3 in</em> Figure 06.8-1). Thus <em>despite</em> the relatively rapid rate and the possibility of ischemia — strong consideration should be given to <em>drug-induced</em> QT prolongation — <em>severe</em> hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia — <em>and/or</em> CNS catastrophe as <em>contributing</em> causes (List #3).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**06.9 – FIGURE 06.9-1: *Is the QT Long? ***</p><p>We conclude this segment on assessment of the QT interval with one more 12-lead tracing (Figure 06.9-1).

Clearly — a heart rate of ~150/minute is <em>too fast</em> to accurately apply the “eyeball method” for QT assessment. That said — a look at <em>multiple</em> leads in Figure 06.9-1 — suggests that the QT interval makes up as much as ~80% (<em>if not more</em>) of the R-R interval.</p><ul><li>While <em>numerical</em> determination of a QTc is <em>not</em> realistic for the ECG in Figure 06.9-1 (<em>because the rate is too fast</em>) — we strongly suspect the QT is significantly prolonged.

The <strong><em>computer-calculated</em> QTc</strong> is usually quite accurate. As a result — a perfectly appropriate approach is to first <em>estimate</em> QT interval duration yourself by the “eyeball method” (<em>the QT should not be more than half the R-R interval</em>) — and, to <em>then</em> check this out with the QTc value provided by the computer:</p><ul><li>The <strong>upper <em>normal</em> limit</strong> for the <strong>QTc</strong> is** ~450msec**. QTc values greater than this suggest QT prolongation.</li><li>Clinically — concern about QT prolongation increases once the QTc <em>exceeds</em> 480 msec (*especially *<em><strong>if >500 msec</strong></em>)!</li></ul><p> </p><p>An advantage of incorporating the <em>computer-calculated</em> QTc value — is that doing so facilitates <strong><em>serial</em> comparison</strong> of <strong>QT duration</strong> in a given patient. For example — <em>slight</em> prolongation of the QTc from a baseline of 430 msec to 445 msec in a patient started on Sotalol (<em>an antiarrhythmic agent known to significantly increase QT duration when used in higher doses</em>) would <em>not</em> necessarily mandate stopping the drug or even lowering the dose. However, continued <em>progressive</em> QT prolongation (<em>say, from 430 msec — to 445 msec — to 470 msec</em>) *— *would clearly require reassessment of the treatment regimen.</p><p><strong>06.11 – BEYOND-the-Core: <em>Estimating the QTc Yourself</em></strong></p><p>For those providers with a desire to quickly estimate the QTc on their own <em>without</em> need to use the <em>computer-calculated</em> value — We propose the following:</p><ul><li>The formula for determining <strong>QTc</strong> = the QT that you measure — divided by the <strong><em>square</em> root</strong> of the <strong>R-R interval</strong>.

This quadrant is the <em>furthest</em> away from the heart — and is often referred to as the <em>“northwest quadrant”</em> – or – <em>“No-man’s land”</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><hr><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Note:</strong> Although by the **<em>Quadrant <em>Approach</em></em> we describe an axis of +95° as “RAD” and an axis of -10° as “LAD” — we emphasize that this <em>minimal</em> amount of axis deviation is <em>not</em> of clinical consequence. It is <em>rarely</em> important to be more precise than within 20-to-30° of the actual axis.</p><p><strong>07.3 – AXIS: <em>The Concept of Net QRS Deflection</em></strong></p><p>Determination of the mean axis <em><strong>quadrant</strong></em> can be made *at a glance — *by inspection (<em>and comparison</em>) of the <strong><em>net</em> QRS deflection</strong> in <strong>lead I</strong> vs <strong>lead aVF</strong>. To determine the <em>“net”</em> QRS deflection in any given lead <em>— Mentally</em> subtract <em>negative</em> deflections from <em>positive</em> ones (<strong>Figure 07.3-1</strong>). It is “net area” that counts. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 07.3-1) *— *is <em>all</em> positive.</li><li><strong>Panel B</strong> *— *is <em>predominantly</em> positive (<em>compared to the R wave, the s wave is small</em>).</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> <em>— <em>is</em> predominantly</em> positive (<em>with a small q wave and a small s wave — but a tall R wave</em>).</li><li><strong>Panel D</strong> *— *is positive (<em>albeit with no more than a small R wave</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The reason we use both <em><strong>small-case</strong></em> and <strong><em>large-case</em> letters</strong> in describing Q, R and S wave deflections *— *is to convey <strong><em>relative</em> size</strong>. While we are <em>not</em> aware of any official distinction between <em>small</em>- vs *large-case — *We favor use of <strong>3 mm</strong> (<em>3 little boxes</em>) as our defining characteristic:</p><ul><li><strong>Q</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>S</strong> waves all manifest an amplitude of <strong><em>at least</em> 3 mm</strong>.</li><li>The amplitude of <strong>q</strong>, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>s waves</strong> is 3 mm or less. We generally use a <em>small-case</em> designation for 3 mm deflections that are narrow vs <em>large-case</em> designation for a 3 mm deflection that is wider. Thus, we describe the complex in <strong>Panel C</strong> of Fig. 07.3-1 as a <strong>qRs</strong> deflection.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 07.3-1:</strong> Illustration of how to assess <strong><em>“net”</em> QRS deflection</strong>.

This is one reason why LPHB is uncommon. The other reason is a richer (<em>dual</em>) blood supply compared to the anterior hemifascicle. As a result — it is <em><strong>rare</strong></em> to see <strong>LPHB</strong> as an <strong><em>isolated</em> defect</strong> in a patient <em>without</em> significant heart disease. Most patients with LPHB have <em>bifascicular</em> block (<em>RBBB/LPHB</em> — <em>See Sections 07.20, 07.21</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 07.10-1:</strong> The ventricular conduction system.

In reality — there are <em>millions</em> of fibers in the ventricular conduction system with many potential anatomic variants on the arrangement shown. That said, <em>most</em> of the time — conduction fibers to the left ventricle are arranged in two large groups (<em>hemifascicles</em>) — one of which is situated slightly in front (<em>anterior</em>) of the other.</p><ul><li>The benefit of accepting the arrangement in Figure 07.10-1 as the general anatomic model, is that it greatly <strong><em>simplifies</em> diagnosis</strong> of the <strong>hemiblocks</strong>!</li></ul><p> </p><p>**07.11 – <em>Advanced <em>Concept: LSFB (<em>a 3rd type of Fascicular Block</em>)</em></em></p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> In a significant percentage of patients — a <strong>3rd</strong> (<em>septal</em>) <strong>hemifascicle</strong> appears to exist (<em>not shown in</em> Fig. 07.10-1). The collection of fibers that make up this <strong><em>septal</em> hemifascicle</strong> is thinner, more variable in distribution than are fibers in the anterior and posterior hemifascicles, and generally manifests a shorter refractory period. As its name implies — fibers from the <em>septal</em> hemifascicle contribute to early activation of a portion of the ventricular septum in certain patients.</p><ul><li>As a result — a 3rd type of <em>partial</em> LBBB conduction block (<em>in addition to LAHB and LPHB</em>) may occur = <strong>LSFB</strong> (<em>Left Septal Fascicular Block</em>).</li><li><strong>LSFB</strong> is <strong><em>not</em> commonly recognized on ECG</strong>. This is because of several reasons: <strong>i)</strong> the existence of this 3rd hemifascicle is <em>not</em> well appreciated; <strong>ii)</strong> LSFB is uncommon; and <strong>iii)</strong> ECG manifestations of LSFB when it <em>does</em> occur are often masked by <em>simultaneous</em> occurrence of <em>other</em> conduction defects. Practically speaking — <em>Do NOT</em> be concerned about recognizing LSFB <em>unless</em> you are a student of <em>advanced</em> arrhythmia interpretation.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Our reason for mentioning the existence in some patients of a <em>septal</em> hemifascicle and therefore a potential <em>3rd type</em> of fascicular block is twofold: <strong>i)</strong> to shed light on the otherwise unexplained <em>coming-and-going</em> of septal q waves (<em>or of the initial small r wave in V1,V2</em>) that is sometimes seen in some challenging arrhythmias (<em>may be due to intermittent LSFB aberrant conduction</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> to emphasize that the <strong><em>anatomic</em> arrangement</strong> presented in <strong>Figure 07.10-1</strong> is a <strong>simplification</strong>. This simplification works well for understanding the general anatomic pattern of the ventricular conduction system — and it allows <em>rapid</em> diagnosis of the hemiblocks (<em>Section 07.12</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>07.12 – Hemiblocks: <em>An Approach to Rapid ECG Diagnosis</em></strong></p><p>Agreement among experts is <em>lacking</em> regarding diagnostic criteria for hemiblock. Some experts specify a certain number of degrees in axis deviation — whereas others favor QRS morphology change rather than axis criteria. Fortunately — ECG diagnosis of hemiblocks can be simplified into an <em>equally</em> accurate yet <strong><em>user-friendly</em> approach</strong> that allows classification in <em>less</em> than 5 seconds. This approach is based on the following concepts:</p><ul><li>There are <strong>2 hemiblocks</strong> that we need to concern ourselves with: <em><strong>anterior</strong></em> and <em><strong>posterior</strong></em>*. *Life is simpler (<em>and no less accurate in the overwhelming majority of cases</em>) if we do <em>not</em> initially concern ourself about the infrequent, <em>difficult-to-diagnose</em> 3rd type of conduction deflect = LSFB (<em>Section 07.11</em>).</li><li>Of the 2 types of hemiblock that we <em>do</em> need to concern ourselves with <em>—</em> <em><strong>L</strong></em><em>eft <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>osterior <strong><strong>H</strong></strong>emi</em><em><strong>B</strong></em>*lock *(<strong>LPHB</strong>) — is <strong>rare</strong>! As already emphasized (<em>Section 07.10</em>) <em>—</em> the reason LPHB is so uncommon is that the <em>posterior</em> hemifascicle is much <em>thicker</em> anatomically and it has a <em>dual</em> blood supply (<em>from the left and right coronary arteries</em>); the anterior hemifascicle does not.</li><li><em>Even</em> <strong>experts</strong> often <strong>do <em>not</em> agree</strong> on the ECG diagnosis of <strong>LPHB.</strong> As a result — You are probably <em>none the worse</em> if you <em>never</em> diagnose LPHB. On those uncommon occasions when LPHB <em>does</em> occur — it will almost always be seen in association with RBBB (<em>See Section 07.21 and 07.25</em>).</li><li>In contrast — diagnosis of **LAHB (<em>L</em>**<em>eft <strong><strong>A</strong></strong>nterior <strong><strong>H</strong></strong>emi-<strong><strong>B</strong></strong>lock</em>) — is far more common (><em>98% of hemiblocks in our experience</em>). ECG <em><strong>diagnosis</strong></em> of <strong>LAHB</strong> <em>becomes</em> easy — IF you accept as your criterion for diagnosis recognition of a <strong><em>pathologic</em> left axis</strong> (<em>Section 07.13</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**07.13 – LAHB: <em>ECG Diagnosis = “pathologic” <em>LAD</em></em></p><p>Expert electrocardiographers do <em>not</em> agree on how to define LAHB.

In the presence of <strong>RBBB</strong> — electrical activity first goes <strong>left-to-right</strong> (<em>as the septum is depolarized</em>) — then <strong>right-to-left</strong> (<em>as the left ventricle is depolarized</em>) — and then <em><strong>left-to-right</strong></em>* again* as the <em>blocked</em> right ventricle is finally activated via slow myocardial conduction through <em>nonspecialized</em> fibers. So in the setting of RBBB — the <em>“average direction”</em> of the heart’s electrical activity does <em>not</em> reflect the actual <em>zig-zag</em> path of the depolarization impulse.</p><ul><li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> — <em>Don’t worry about “axis”</em> when RBBB is present!</li><li>All we care about when there is <strong>RBBB</strong> — is <em>which</em> of these <strong>3 <em>possible</em> settings</strong> is operative: <strong>i) RBBB</strong> and <em>nothing</em> else; <strong>ii)</strong> RBBB <em>plus</em>** LAHB**; or <strong>iii)</strong> RBBB <em>plus</em>** LPHB**.</li><li>The ECG picture of <strong>RBBB/LAHB</strong> is <em>easy</em> to recognize. In addition to RBBB — We can tell at a glance IF <strong>LAHB</strong> is <em>also</em> present by a <em><strong>look</strong></em> at <strong>lead II</strong> to see IF the <em>net</em> QRS deflection is <em>predominantly</em> negative (Figure 07.18-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>07.20 – <em>Clinical Implications of Bifascicular Block</em></strong></p><p>The clinical significance of virtually <em>any</em> conduction system defect depends on the setting in which it occurs. **<em>Isolated <em>RBBB</em></em> may sometimes occur in otherwise healthy individuals <em>without</em> underlying heart disease — in which case RBBB is <em>unlikely</em> to have any adverse prognostic implications (<em>Section 05.5</em>). In contrast — a **<em>new <em>finding</em></em> of <strong>RBBB</strong> in the setting of acute evolving MI implies <em>ongoing</em> conduction system damage (<em>suggesting a larger infarct size and possible need for a pacemaker</em>).</p><ul><li>**<em>Bifascicular <em>block</em></em> — clearly implies a more important conduction defect than *isolated *RBBB. That said — IF the patient is otherwise *asymptomatic, *then <em>bifascicular</em> block from <strong>RBBB/LAHB</strong> may *not *necessarily convey any adverse prognostic implications. <em>Combined</em> RBBB/LAHB is seen surprisingly often as an <em>incidental</em> finding in an otherwise asymptomatic older individual.</li><li>On the other hand — IF *new *RBBB/LAHB develops in the setting of acute coronary syndrome — the extent of damage is probably large (<em>and the patient may soon need a pacemaker</em>). <em>Clinical</em> context is everything!</li><li>The <em>other</em> form of <em>bifascicular</em> block =** RBBB/LPHB** — is <strong>much <em>less</em> common</strong>. As previously stated (<em>Section 07.10</em>) — the reason LPHB is so uncommon relates to its anatomy (<em>much thicker fascicle</em>) and <em>dual</em> blood supply. As a result, IF <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong> <em>does</em> occur — it implies a more extensive conduction system defect (<em>with potentially more severe prognostic implications</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>07.21 – RBBB/LPHB: <em>ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>The <em>uncommon</em> form of <strong><em>bifascicular</em> block</strong> — is the <em>combination</em> of <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong>. The <em>schematic</em> tracing in Figure 07.21-1 shows the typical ECG appearance of this conduction defect. Note the <em>underlying</em> rhythm is sinus (<em>upright P wave in lead II</em>) and the QRS looks to be wide.

In support of the diagnosis of RBBB/LPHB — is the presence of a qR pattern in lead II with a relatively tall R wave in this lead.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Leads II, III and aVF all typically manifest a <em>similar</em> ECG appearance when there is RBBB <em>plus</em> LPHB (ie,* a qR pattern with relatively tall R wave*). That said — We can <em>simplify</em> the process of recognizing RBBB/LPHB by focusing attention on QRS appearance in the 3 <em>key</em> leads (<em>I,V1,V6</em>) — <em>plus</em> on lead II — as is done in <strong>Figure 07.21-1</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 07.21-1</strong>: RBBB/LPHB.** RBBB** — is diagnosed by the rSR’ in lead V1 <em>with</em> wide, terminal S waves in I,V6. <strong>LPHB</strong> — is diagnosed by the very <em>steep</em> initial descent of the S wave in lead I. In addition — Note the qR pattern in lead II with relatively tall R wave (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>07.22 – RBBB/LPHB: <em>Finer Points on ECG Recognition</em></strong></p><p>The experts often do <em>not</em> agree on the diagnosis of <em>bifascicular</em> block from <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong>. The <em>KEY</em> to recognizing this form of bifascicular block is that once <em>complete</em> RBBB is identified — <em>Focus</em> attention on <strong>S wave <em>descent</em></strong> in <strong>lead I.</strong></p><ul><li>As emphasized in Section 05.4 — a wide <em>terminal</em> S wave in <em>lateral</em> leads I,V6 is part of the <em>expected</em> QRS morphology seen with <em>complete</em> RBBB (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 07.22-1). That said — the initial (<em>straight portion</em>) of the S wave in lead I is <em>not</em> nearly as steep with <em>isolated</em> RBBB — as it is when LPHB is also present (<em>red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> <em>of</em> Fig. 07.22-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 07.22-1</strong>: RBBB by itself (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — compared to <em>bifascicular</em> block when there is RBBB <em>plus</em> LPHB (<strong>Panel B</strong>). Note the very <em>steep</em> initial descent of the S wave (<em>red arrow</em>) in lead I when LPHB is also present (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Because the <strong><em>posterior</em> hemifascicle</strong> lies not only posterior, but <em>also</em> inferior and rightward (<em>in 3 dimensions</em>) with respect to the anterior hemifascicle — the *blocked *portion of the QRS deflection in lead I is directed inferior and to the right. This is the reason for the <em>steep</em> negative S wave descent in lead I and the predominant <em>positive</em> R wave in leads II, III, and aVF (<strong>Panel B</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 07.22-1).</p><ul><li>Typically — there will also be a slender initial r wave in lead I and a small narrow q wave in the <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) when there is <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong>. This is because the <em>initial</em> direction of left ventricular depolarization with RBBB/LPHB is toward that part of the LV supplied by the <em>intact</em> left anterior hemifascicle. Given the <em>relative</em> leftward and superior orientation of the <strong>left <em>anterior</em> hemifascicle</strong> (<em>compared to the relative rightward and inferior orientation of the posterior hemifascicle</em>) — initial electrical activity with RBBB/LPHB tends to produce a small r in lead I and a small q in inferior leads (<strong>Panel B</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 07.22-1). That said — these subtle ECG features might be altered if in addition to RBBB/LPHB there has been prior scarring or infarction.</li><li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> — Remember that <em>bifascicular</em> block from <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong> is uncommon in clinical practice. ECG diagnosis is often challenging and encompasses an <em>advanced</em> subject area about which cardiologists do <em>not</em> always agree. You are probably <em>none the worse</em> if you <em>never</em> diagnose this entity. Our goal is merely to highlight the ECG features we find helpful for recognizing RBBB/LPHB when it is present. Realize that once you do identify this form of <em>bifascicular</em> block — it is almost certain that your patient has <em>extensive</em> underlying heart disease.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>07.23 – FIGURE 07.23-1: <em>Is there Bifascicular Block?</em></strong></p><p>Assess the ECG in Figure 07.23-1 for the presence of conduction defects.</p><ul><li>Is there <em>bifascicular</em> block?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 07.23-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm <em>with</em> <strong>RBBB/LPHB</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 07.23-1:</strong> The rhythm is sinus.

The PR interval is prolonged (<em>clearly more than a large box in duration</em>) — so there is <strong>1st degree AV block</strong> (<em>Section 02.70</em>).</p><ul><li>The QRS complex is wide. Blowup inserts from the 3 <em>key</em> leads (<em>I,V1,V6</em>) — confirm <strong>RBBB</strong> (<em>rSR’ in V1; wide terminal S waves in leads I and V6</em>).

Even in the best of hands — the <em><strong>sensitivity</strong></em> of ECG for detecting ***LVH *<em><em>does <em>not</em> exceed 60% (<em>although specificity may approach 90 to 95% when certain criteria are met</em>). Diagnostic accuracy for determining <em><strong>RVH</strong></em> (<em><strong>R</strong></em></em>ight <strong><strong>V</strong></strong>entricular <strong><strong>H</strong></strong>ypertrophy</em>) and atrial enlargement is even less … (<em>See Sections 08.14-through-08.22; and 08.23-through-08.33</em>).</p><ul><li>Echocardiography is far superior to the ECG for diagnosing enlargement of <em>any</em> cardiac chamber.</li><li>Therefore — IF you truly <em>need</em> to know — <em>Get an Echo!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.1 – ECG Diagnosis of LVH: <em>Simplified Criteria</em></strong></p><p>There are *more than *50 sets of criteria in the literature for ECG diagnosis of LVH. <em>None are optimal</em>. The <strong><em>simplified</em> criteria</strong> for <strong>LVH</strong> we favor as providing what we feel is the <em>best</em> balance between sensitivity and specificity are shown in <strong>Figure 08.1-1</strong>.</p><p><strong>Figure 08.1-1:</strong> <em>Simplified</em> ECG criteria for LVH (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Points:</strong> The “beauty” of Figure 08.1-1 is that these <em>simplified</em> criteria <em>only</em> require recall of <strong>2 numbers</strong> = <strong>“35”</strong> and <strong>“12”</strong>. In our experience — these 2 criteria <em>almost</em> always allow diagnosis whenever it is possible by ECG to determine that there is LVH.</p><ul><li>Only one <strong><em>voltage</em> criterion</strong> (ie, <em>35</em> or <em>12</em>) — needs to be satisfied for ECG diagnosis of LVH.</li><li>Note that voltage criteria for LVH may <em><strong>not</strong></em> be <strong>valid</strong> for <strong><em>younger</em> patients</strong>. This is because <em>younger</em> adults (<em>in their 20’s</em>) often manifest increased QRS amplitude <em>without</em> true chamber enlargement. We suggest <em><strong>not</strong></em> using the voltage criteria in Figure 08.1-1 for patients <em><strong>less</strong></em> than <strong>35 years old</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>accuracy</strong> (<em>specificity</em>) for the ECG diagnosis of LVH can be <strong><em>greatly</em> increased</strong> — IF <em>in addition</em> to satisfying one or more voltage criteria, ST-T wave changes of <em><strong>&ldquo;LV strain&rdquo;</strong></em> are <em>also</em> present (<em>Section 08.9</em>).</li><li>The <strong><em>Clinical</em> History</strong> helps in <em><strong>assessing</strong></em> for <strong>LVH</strong>. For example, it is important to appreciate even <em>before</em> looking at the ECG itself — that the chance of <em>true</em> chamber enlargement is <em>greatly</em> increased IF the tracing is obtained from a middle-aged, African-American man with <strong><em>longterm</em> hypertension</strong>. KEY POINT: A history of **<em>underlying <em>heart disease</em></em> (<em>heart failure, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, coronary artery disease</em>) — clearly <em><strong>increases</strong></em> the <strong>likelihood</strong> of <strong>LVH</strong> in <em>any</em> given patient.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.2 – LVH: <em>Physiologic Rationale for Voltage Criteria</em></strong></p><p>The <em>physiologic</em> rationale for derivation of virtually <em>all</em> voltage criteria for LVH is simple. We illustrate this concept in <strong>Figure 08.2-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>Normal <strong>LV</strong> (<em>Left Ventricle</em>) activation is directed <em>away</em> from <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> (ie, <em>V1,V2</em>) — and toward <strong><em>left-sided</em> leads</strong> (<em>aVL; V5,V6</em>). As a result — leads V1,V2 <em>normally</em> manifest a predominant S wave.</li><li>Since the LV is situated to the left and posteriorly in the thorax — normal LV activation generally results in a <em>predominant</em> R wave in <em>left-sided</em> leads aVL,V5,V6 (<strong>Panel A</strong> in Fig. 08.2-1). With <strong>LVH</strong> — there is <em>more</em> LV mass (<em>large red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong>). As a result — the S wave in V1,V2 becomes deeper; and the R wave in aVL <em>and/or</em> V5,V6 becomes taller.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.2-1:</strong> Rationale for derivation of LVH voltage criteria. There is <em>deepening</em> of the S wave in <em>right-sided</em> leads = V1,V2; and/or an <em>increase</em> in R wave amplitude in <em>left-sided</em> leads (ie, <em>V5,V6, aVL</em>).</p><p><strong>08.3 – LVH: <em>ECG Diagnosis using Lead aVL</em></strong></p><p>In Section 03 — We discussed localization of <strong>lead aVL</strong> in the hexaxial lead system (<em>looking down at the heart from the left shoulder at an angle of approximately -30 degrees</em>). We then specified anatomic landmarks used for <strong><em>precordial</em> lead placement</strong> when recording an ECG (<em>Section 03.6</em>). Awareness of this <em>relative</em> position of <em>unipolar</em> <strong>lead aVL</strong> (<em>looking down at the heart from the left shoulder</em>) — allows us to envision how lead aVL views the heart’s electrical activity from a <strong><em>higher</em> perspective</strong> than <strong><em>precordial</em> leads</strong> (ie, <em>V1,V2; V5,V6</em>) that are placed on the chest.</p><ul><li>As a result — Use of the criterion for <strong>R wave amplitude</strong> in <strong>lead aVL ≥12mm</strong> is likely to be <em>most</em> helpful when there is a <strong><em>leftward</em> axis</strong> (<em>this aVL criterion may satisfy voltage for LVH despite sometimes minimal QRS size in V1,V2 and V5,V6</em>).</li><li>Remember — Only 1 voltage criterion (<em>35</em> or <em>12</em>) is needed to satisfy “voltage for LVH”.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.3-1: <em>LVH using Lead aVL</em></strong></p><p>We illustrate use of lead aVL for making the diagnosis of LVH by voltage in Figure 08.3-1. This ECG was obtained from an older adult with hypertension. R wave amplitude in lead aVL is clearly increased (<em>more than 3 large boxes — or greater than 15 mm</em>). However — there is no indication at all of voltage for LVH from assessment of QRS amplitude in the <em>precordial</em> leads (<em>deepest S in V1,V2 + tallest R in V5,V6 is very much less than 35 mm</em>).</p><ul><li>Since only 1 voltage criterion is needed — the presence of a <em>tall</em> R wave in lead aVL (≥<em>12 mm</em>) in Figure 08.3-1 satisfies voltage criteria for LVH.</li><li>Note there is LAD — as is evident from the predominantly <em>negative</em> QRS in lead aVF with <em>positive</em> QRS in lead I. This supports the premise that lead aVL tends to be most helpful as a voltage criterion for LVH in the presence of a <em>leftward</em> axis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.3-1:</strong> ECG obtained from an older adult with hypertension. Voltage criteria for LVH <em>are</em> satisfied by the <em>tall</em> R wave in lead aVL (≥<em>12 mm</em>) — despite relatively low voltage in the precordial leads (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>08.4 – FIGURE 08.4-1: <em>Is there Voltage for LVH?</em></strong></p><p>The ECG in <strong>Figure 08.4-1</strong> was obtained from an otherwise healthy 29-year old man who was seen in the office for an “insurance physical”.</p><ul><li><em>Is there LVH?</em></li><li>HINT: Feel free to review the <em>simplified</em> criteria for LVH in Figure 08.1-1 before answering.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.4-1:</strong> ECG from a 29-year old man. <em>Is there LVH?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 08.4-1:</strong> The ECG shows sinus arrhythmia and is essentially normal. <em>There is no LVH</em> — because this patient is <em>less</em> than 35 years old. Note that ST-T waves are unremarkable. There is <em>no</em> indication of LV “strain”.</p><ul><li>We illustrate how to assess for voltage by the <em>blow-up</em> of the 4 key precordial leads shown in <strong>Figure 08.4-2</strong>. As per the criteria detailed in Figure 08.1-1 — one adds the <em>deepest</em> S wave in leads V1,V2 <em>plus</em> the <em>tallest</em> R wave in V5,V6. The sum = 43 (ie, 20 + 23=43) — but since the patient is <em>under</em> 35 years of age — voltage for LVH is <em>not</em> present (<em>Section 08.7</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.4-2:</strong> <em>Blowup</em> of selected precordial leads from Figure 08.4-1 to illustrate how QRS amplitude is counted. The <strong><em>deepest</em> S wave</strong> in V1,V2 is <strong>20</strong> (<em>in lead V1</em>) <strong>+</strong> the <strong><em>tallest</em> R wave</strong> in V5, V6 (= <strong>23</strong> <em>in lead V5</em>) is <strong>>35</strong> – BUT – because the patient is <em>less</em> than 35 years of age — voltage for LVH is <em>not</em> present.</p><p><strong>08.5 – <em>Standardization</em> Mark: <em>Is Standardization Normal?</em></strong></p><p>Most of the time — the ECG will be set to <strong><em>normal</em> standardization</strong>. Confirmation that this is the case is easily achieved by recognition of the <strong><em>standardization</em> mark</strong> at the very beginning or end of the 12-lead recording (<em>black arrow at the onset of lead III in</em> Figure 08.4-1).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Normal</em> standardization</strong> is designated by a <em>rectangular</em> standardization mark that is <strong>10 mm</strong> (=<em>2 large boxes</em>)** tall**.</li><li>On occasion — ECG complexes may be extremely large and extend <em>beyond</em> the space provided for one or more leads on the tracing. Selection of <strong><em>half</em> standardization</strong> reduces waveform amplitude by half — with result that the <em>entire</em> complex in each lead will again fit on the ECG recording paper and be seen.</li><li>These concepts are illustrated in <strong>Figure 08.5-1</strong> — in which the <strong><em>Top</em> Panel</strong> is a <em>blow-up</em> of leads III and aVF from Figure 08.4-1.</li><li>IF instead, this ECG was recorded at <strong><em>half</em> standardization</strong> — <em>actual</em> QRS amplitude would be <em>twice</em> that shown = 10 <em>vs</em> 5 in lead III; and 26 <em>vs</em> 13 in lead aVF (<strong><em>Lower</em> Panel</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 08.5-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.5-1:</strong> <em>Blowup</em> of Figure 08.4-1 to illustrate the appearance of a <strong>normal</strong> (<em>top</em>) and <strong>half</strong> (<em>bottom</em>) <strong><em>standardization</em> mark</strong>.

As a result — we occasionally turn to <strong><em>additional</em> voltage criteria</strong>.

The ECG is simply <em>not</em> optimally accurate.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.7 – LVH: <em>Voltage Criteria for Patients Less than 35</em></strong></p><p>Young adults often have increased amplitude <em>not</em> due to true chamber enlargement. As a <strong><em>“ballpark”</em> estimate</strong> for LVH voltage criteria when the patient is <strong>35 years old</strong> — We use sum of the <em>deepest</em> S wave in V1,V2 + <em>tallest</em> R wave in V5,V6 <strong>≥53</strong>. This number ‘53’ can be easily remembered — because it is the <em>reverse</em> of the number ‘35’.</p><ul><li>Look at the selected precordial lead sequence shown in <strong>Figure 08.7-1</strong> (<em>previously shown in</em> Fig. 08.4-2).

We designate this intermediate stage as a <em><strong>strain equivalent”</strong></em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p>***Terminology: *<em><em>In general, when we use the term <em><strong>“strain”</strong></em> — We are referring to <strong>LV “strain”</strong> that develops in response to <em><strong>L</strong></em></em>eft <strong><strong>V</strong></strong>entricular</em> <strong>H</strong>ypertrophy (<em>LVH</em>).</p><ul><li>There is also <strong>RV “strain”</strong> — that typically develops in association with <em>marked</em> RVH or in response to acute <em>pulmonary</em> embolus.

As stated — there is <em>obvious</em> voltage for LVH (<em>very deep S wave in V2 + very tall R wave in V6</em>).</p><ul><li>ST-T wave changes consistent with <strong>LV “strain”</strong> are clearly seen in <strong>lead V6</strong> of Figure 08.9-2. We would interpret the <em>flat</em> ST segment with slight T inversion in <strong>lead V5</strong> as a <em><strong>“strain equivalent”</strong></em> (<em>Section 08.13</em>). <em>Neither</em> aVL <em>nor</em> lead V4 manifest “strain” (<em>upright T wave in these leads</em>). The <em>nonspecific</em> ST-T wave flattening in lead I might be a strain “equivalent” — albeit <em>minimal</em> QRS amplitude in this lead makes this supposition less convincing.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Asymmetric</em> ST-T wave depression in <em>each</em> of the <strong><em>inferior</em> leads</strong> (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) in this tracing looks typical for <strong>LV “strain”</strong> (<em>closely resembles</em> <strong>Panel C</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 08.9-1). Given the relatively vertical axis (<em>about +75 degrees</em>) — it is far <em>more</em> likely that these inferior ST-T wave changes reflect LV “strain” rather than ischemia (<em>especially if the patient is not having new or recent chest discomfort</em>). Thus, the ECG in Fig. 08.9-2 appears to represent an example of the occasional occurrence of LV “strain” in <em>inferior</em> as well as lateral leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> NOTE in Figure 08.9-2 — that the <strong>ST segment</strong> is <em><strong>elevated</strong></em> in <strong>leads V2,V3</strong>.</p><ul><li>Is this likely to reflect an ACS (<em>Acute Coronary Syndrome</em>)?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> As will be discussed in detail in Sections 09 and 10 — ST segment deviations (<em>elevation or depression</em>) are most often judged with respect to the <em>preceding</em> PR segment baseline. With this in mind — there unmistakably is <em>at least</em> 2 mm of ST elevation in leads V2,V3. That said — it is highly <em><strong>unlikely</strong></em> that this <strong><em>anterior</em> ST elevation</strong> represents <strong>ACS</strong> because:</p><ul><li>There is <em>no mention</em> of chest discomfort in this patient with longstanding hypertension.</li><li>In patients with LVH <em>and</em> “strain” — there will often be several mm of ST elevation in <em>anterior</em> leads as a <em><strong>mirror-image</strong></em> reflection of <em>lateral</em> precordial “strain”. Note that IF you <em>flipped over</em> the ECG complex in lead V6 of Figure 08.9-2 (<em>very tall R wave; ST-T changes of strain</em>) — that the result would be <em>identical</em> to what is seen in leads V2,V3 (<em>very deep S wave; mirror-image ST-T wave appearance of what was seen in V6</em>).</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> In addition to ST-T wave depression that may be seen in one or more of the <em>lateral</em> leads with LV “strain” — <em>slight</em> ST elevation (<em>with mirror-image appearance to the ST-T wave in lateral leads</em>) may also be seen in <em>anterior</em> leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.10 – LV “Strain”: <em>Voltage for LVH vs True Chamber Enlargement</em></strong></p><p>The reason it is important to recognize ***“strain” ***— is that this finding <em>greatly</em> increases the <em>accuracy</em> of the ECG diagnosis of LVH.</p><ul><li>The presence of *increased *<strong>voltage <em>without</em> “strain”</strong> — has *low *specificity (<em>50%</em>) for <em>true</em> chamber enlargement (<em>especially if the patient is otherwise healthy and without underlying heart disease</em>). We interpret the finding of <em>increased</em> voltage <em>without</em> ST-T wave changes of “strain as <strong>“Voltage for LVH”</strong>. This designation serves to acknowledge that <em>despite</em> an increase in QRS amplitude — <em>statistical</em> likelihood of true chamber enlargement is low.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> On occasion there may be <em>typical</em> ST-T wave changes of <strong>LV <em>“strain”</em></strong> — but <strong><em>without</em> voltage</strong> for** LVH**. The ECG is simply <em>not</em> that sensitive for demonstrating increased QRS amplitude in patients with anatomic LV chamber enlargement. While we do not advise making a definitive ECG diagnosis of “LVH” in the absence of voltage criteria — We may nevertheless <em>suspect</em> LVH rather than ischemia in the presence of <em>asymmetric</em> ST depression IF: <strong>i)</strong> the history does <em>not</em> sound like there is cardiac chest pain; and <strong>ii)</strong> the patient has one or more conditions predisposing to LVH. Clearly — <em>Clinical correlation is needed</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Assess the ECG in <strong>Figure 08.10-1</strong> for LVH. We previously encountered this tracing in Figure 08.4-1 — at which time we were told that it came from a 29-year old man. Despite sum of <em>deepest</em> S wave in V1,V2 + <em>tallest</em> R wave in V5,V6 being >35mm — the patient’s age (ie, <em>less than 35 years old</em>) meant that voltage criteria for LVH were <em>not</em> fulfilled.</p><ul><li>BUT — What IF instead of a 29-year old man, this ECG had been obtained from a <strong>40-year old man</strong>? Would there <em>now</em> be voltage for LVH?</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> ST-T waves are normal in all lateral leads in Figure 08.10-1 — such that there is <em>no</em> indication of LV “strain”.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.10-1:</strong> ECG previously seen in Fig. 08.4-1.

That said — the <em>absence</em> of any ST-T wave indication of “strain” means that the chance of <em>true</em> chamber enlargement is still low. This is especially true if this 40-year old man was previously healthy with normal blood pressure.</p><p><strong>08.11 – FIGURE 08.11-1: <em>Is there True Chamber Enlargement?</em></strong></p><p>Contrast the ECG just shown in Figure 08.10-1 — with the 6 precordial leads in <strong>Figure 08.11-1</strong>.

In addition — note ST-T wave changes consistent with <strong>LV “strain”</strong> in leads V4,V5,V6*.

This is seen in Figure 08.11-1.</p><ul><li>ECG diagnosis of <strong>LVH</strong> <em>plus</em>** “strain”** is <em>not</em> a trivial one.

The best way to highlight this contrast is by <em>side-to-side</em> comparison of both tracings (<strong>Panels A</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>B</strong> <em>in</em> <strong>Figure 08.12-2</strong>):</p><ul><li>In <em>both</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> — <em>deepest</em> S wave in V1,V2 + <em>tallest</em> R wave in V5,V6 <em>easily</em> satisfy <strong><em>voltage</em> criteria</strong> for <strong>LVH</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Panel A</strong> — ST-T wave appearance in leads V5,V6 strongly suggests <strong>LV “strain”</strong> (<em>there is asymmetric ST depression with slow sagging downslope</em>).</li><li>In contrast, for <strong>Panel B</strong> — ST segments are <em>coved</em> in V3-through-V6. In addition, there is 1-2 mm of J-point ST depression (<em>below the PR segment baseline</em>) in leads V4,V5,V6 — with <strong>T wave inversion</strong> that is <em><strong>deep</strong></em> and appears to be much <strong><em>more</em> symmetric</strong> (<em>especially in leads V4,V5</em>). This appearance is <em>more</em> suggestive of <strong>ischemia</strong>.</li><li>In particular — <strong>lead V3</strong> in <strong>Panel B</strong> looks <strong>ischemic</strong> (<em>pure LV “strain” virtually never produces ST coving and symmetric T inversion this far anterior</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead V6</strong> in Panel B — has an <em>intermediate</em> appearance between “strain” <em>and/or</em> ischemia. Given that this patient is “older” and has a history of heart disease and <em>decidedly</em> meets voltage criteria for LVH — We would interpret this tracing as, <strong>“LVH <em>and</em> “strain” <em>and</em>/<em>or</em> ischemia.”</strong> <em>Clinical</em> correlation and <em>comparison</em> with prior tracings would be needed to determine IF an <em>acute</em> ischemic process might be ongoing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.12-2:</strong> Comparison of the precordial lead sequence from Figure 08.11-1 (<strong>Panel A</strong>) with that from Figure 08.12-1 (<strong>Panel B</strong>). Voltage criteria for LVH are easily satisfied in each tracing. ST-T wave changes in Panel B are much more suggestive of LVH <em>with</em> ischemia <em>and/or</em> “strain” (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>Return to <strong>Panel A</strong> in Figure 08.12-2. Note that the J-point appears to be slightly <em>depressed</em> in leads V4-through-V6, and that there is subtle ST <em>coving</em> in the depressed ST segment in V4. Thus, although the overall picture in Panel A is clearly <em>more</em> suggestive of LVH with “strain” — We can <em>not</em> exclude the possibility of some component of ischemia.</p><ul><li><em>Clinical correlation is needed</em>.</li><li>Availability of <em>prior</em> tracings on this patient would help to determine whether J-point depression in Panel A is new or old.

This explains why in theory — the <strong>P wave</strong> in <strong>lead V1</strong> should normally be <em><strong>biphasic</strong></em>, with an initial <em>positive</em> component (<em>as the RA is depolarized</em>) — followed by a <em>negative</em> component (<em>as the LA is depolarized</em>).</li><li>In Practice — the <strong><em>normal</em> P wave</strong> in** lead V1** may be positive, negative or biphasic (<em>as is shown under NSR in</em> Fig. 08.16-1).</li><li>The reason the <strong>P wave</strong> is normally <em><strong>upright</strong></em> in <strong>lead II</strong> with sinus rhythm is shown in <strong>Panel C</strong> of Figure 08.17-1.

This is why we strongly <strong><em>suspect</em> RVH</strong> is <em>also</em> present in the patient with cardiomyopathy whose ECG was shown in Figure 08.22-1. In the <em>clinical</em> context of heart failure <em>with</em> evidence of multi-chamber enlargement on ECG (<em>RAA/LAA/LVH</em>) — the markedly <em>negative</em> QRS complex in lead I of Fig. 08.22-1 (<em>which we reproduce below in</em> <strong>Figure 08.25-1</strong>) suggests there is <em>also</em> enlargement of the 4th cardiac chamber (= <em>RVH</em>).</li><li><strong>RAA</strong> —** **It is usually easy to recognize the tall, <strong>p</strong>eaked, <strong>p</strong>ointed <strong>P</strong> waves of RAA (<em>Section 08.19</em>). <strong>PEARL:</strong> Only <em>one</em> condition produces RAA without at the same time producing RVH (<em>= tricuspid stenosis</em>). Therefore — identifying <strong>RAA</strong> on ECG is an <strong><em>indirect</em> sign</strong> that <strong>RVH</strong> is <em><strong>very likely</strong></em>. This was the case for the patient with cardiomyopathy whose ECG was shown in Fig. 08.22-1 (<em>reproduced below in</em> <strong>Figure 08.25-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.25-1:</strong> This ECG is <em>reproduced</em> from Fig. 08.22-1. The patient has a history of heart failure. The ECG shows <strong>RAA</strong> (<em>tall, peaked P wave in lead II</em>); <strong>LAA</strong> (<em>deep negative component to the P in V1</em>); and <strong>LVH</strong> with “strain” <em>and/or</em> ischemia (<em>markedly increased QRS amplitude in precordial leads with ST-T wave changes in V3-through-V6</em>). We strongly suspect a <strong>cardiomyopathy</strong> <em>with</em> enlargement of the 4th cardiac chamber (= <strong>RVH</strong>) because <em>in addition to</em> LAA/LVH: <strong>i) RAA</strong> is <em>also</em> present; and <strong>ii)</strong> there is otherwise unexplained <strong><em>marked</em> RAD</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>08.26 – RVH: <em>Review of Additional Criteria</em></strong></p><p>Some findings in Figure 08.24-1 are more suggestive of RVH <em>and/or</em> pulmonary disease than others. The findings we describe below are <em>less</em> specific when seen in isolation — but they may be <em>diagnostic</em> when they occur in combination (<em>as we demonstrate in the next few sections</em>). Remember — <em>Not</em> all findings are seen in every patient.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Indeterminate</em> Axis</strong> — Alterations in lung volume with emphysema often lead to <em>rightward</em> and <em>posterior</em> axis deviation. As a result — <em>net</em> QRS deflection in <em>both</em> leads I and aVF may become negative. <strong>PEARL:</strong> IF ever you see an <em>indeterminate</em> axis — <em>Think</em> <strong>RVH</strong>/<strong>COPD</strong>/<strong>Obesity</strong> (<em>Section 07.8</em>).</li><li><strong>IRBBB</strong> (<em>rSr’ in V1</em>) — The presence of an <strong>r’</strong> (<em>r prime</em>) in <strong>lead V1</strong> suggests that *terminal *electrical activity is directed toward the right. While this ECG sign is often benign and commonly seen as an <em>isolated</em> finding in otherwise <em>healthy</em> individuals (<em>Section 05.18</em>) — it supports the diagnosis of pulmonary disease/<em>possible</em> RVH if seen in association with <em>other</em> suggestive findings.</li><li>**<em>Persistent <em>S Waves</em></em> — R wave amplitude normally increases as one moves across the precordial leads (<em>as electrical activity moves toward the left where the larger LV lies</em>). R wave amplitude usually peaks (<em>is tallest</em>) in V4 or V5 — and then drops off (<em>in V5,V6</em>). Normally, there is <em>not</em> any S wave at all in V5,V6 — since by this time in the depolarization process all electrical activity is traveling leftward. IF <em>more</em> than tiny <strong>S waves</strong> are **<em>still <em>present</em></em> in <strong>V5,V6</strong> — this implies significant <em>rightward</em> activity is still ongoing (*Think <strong><strong>RVH</strong></strong>/<strong><strong>COPD</strong></strong>/*<em><strong>large body habitus</strong></em>). That said — this finding is <em>not</em> present in Figure 08.25-1 (<em>although a ~5mm S wave is seen in lead V5 — no S wave at all is seen in lead V6</em>).</li><li>***Low Voltage ***— Air is <em>not</em> a good conductor of electricity. The large emphysematous chest of a patient with COPD dampens (<em>reduces</em>) voltage. Technically — <em><strong>“low voltage”</strong></em> is defined as QRS amplitude <strong>≤5 mm</strong> (ie, <em>≤1 large box</em>) in <em>all</em> **6 <em>limb <em>leads</em></em> (<em>I,II,III; aVR,aVL,aVF</em>). That said — we also use <em>“low voltage”</em> as a **<em>relative <em>term</em></em> when <strong><em>overall</em> QRS amplitude</strong> <em>subjectively</em> appears to be reduced. When you see <em><strong>“low voltage”</strong></em> — *Think *<strong>COPD</strong> (<em>although low voltage may also be seen in hypothyroidism; obesity; pneumothorax; pericardial effusion; <em>or</em> as a normal variant</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Using the above definition for <strong><em>low</em> voltage</strong> (ie, <em>the QRS being ≤5 mm in all 6 limb leads</em>) — this ECG finding is <em>not</em> all that common. When <em>low</em> voltage is seen — it is a <strong><em>nonspecific</em> finding</strong>. That said — IF <em>low</em> voltage is noted in the presence of <em>other</em> criteria for RVH, this finding <em>adds support</em> to the diagnosis of probable <em>pulmonary</em> disease (<em>especially in a patient with a history of smoking</em>).</p><p><em><em>08.27 –</em> Schamroth’s</em> Sign for RVH: *A Null Vector in Lead I ***</p><p>*Beyond-the-Core: *We draw attention to an interesting, uncommon finding known as **<em>Schamroth’s <em>Sign</em></em>. This is the presence of a <strong><em>null</em> vector</strong> (<em>or very small QRS complex</em>) in <strong>lead I</strong> that is <em>not</em> due to technical error/lead misplacement (<strong>Figure 08.27-1</strong>). When seen in the “right” clinical setting (ie, <em>a patient with COPD/pulmonary disease</em>) — then this ECG finding is <em>highly</em> suggestive of <strong><em>advanced</em> pulmonary disease</strong> with <strong><em>probable</em> RVH</strong> (<em>especially if other findings in</em> Figure 08.24-1 <em>are also present</em>).</p><p><strong>Figure 08.27-1:</strong> Schamroth’s sign. Note the <em><strong>“null vector”</strong></em> in <strong>lead I</strong>. RAA is also present (<em>tall, peaked P wave in lead II</em>). When seen in a patient with pulmonary disease and <em>not</em> due to technical error — Schamroth’s sign suggests disease is severe and that there is <em>probable</em> RVH (<em>See also Section 08.33</em>).</p><p><strong>08.28 – RVH: <em>Tall R Wave in V1; RV “Strain”</em></strong></p><p>The 2 findings in Figure 08.24-1 that best <em>distinguish</em> between pulmonary disease <em>with</em> vs <em>without</em> associated RVH are: <strong>i)</strong> presence of a <em>tall</em> R wave in lead V1; and <strong>ii)</strong> presence of RV “strain”.</p><ul><li><em><strong>Tall R Wave in Lead V1</strong></em> — Lead V1 is a <em>right-sided</em> lead. As a result, the QRS is normally <em>negative</em> in lead V1 (<em>electrical activity moves toward the larger LV and away from V1</em>). IF the <strong>R wave</strong> is <em><strong>taller</strong></em> than the <strong>S wave</strong> in <strong>lead V1</strong> — this means **<em>rightward <em>forces</em></em> are ***increased ***(<em>which may be an important sign of RVH</em>). Clinically — by the time a <em>tall</em> R wave is seen in lead V1 in an adult with pulmonary disease — the extent of <strong>RVH</strong> is usually <em><strong>marked</strong></em> (ie, <em>the patient is likely to have end-stage COPD and/or pulmonary hypertension</em>). This is the case in <em>schematic</em> <strong>Figure 08.29-1</strong> shown below.</li><li><strong>RV “Strain”</strong> — Just as LV “strain” is a sign of *true *LVH — seeing <em><strong>“strain”</strong></em> in one or both of the **<em>right-sided <em>lead areas</em></em> (<em>II,III,aVF <em>— and/or —</em> V1,V2,V3</em>) strongly <em><strong>supports</strong></em> a diagnosis of <strong>RVH</strong> (Figure 08.29-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.29 – <em>Schematic</em> FIGURE 08.29-1: <em>Example of RVH + RV “Strain”</em></strong></p><p>Most of the ECG criteria for <strong>RVH</strong> are present in <strong><em>schematic</em> Figure 08.29-1</strong>.

Instead — We use this descriptor as a <em>qualitative</em> term that may help to explain a <em>combination</em> of ECG findings that are likely to be seen in a group of patients with longstanding/severe pulmonary disorders. As stated — the point at which “pulmonary disease” <em>crosses over</em> to cor pulmonale with <em>frank</em> RVH is often elusive and <em>not</em> detectable by ECG. An Echo would be far more informative regarding true <em>right-sided</em> chamber size, function and pressures.</p><ul><li>We suspect <em><strong>“pulmonary disease”</strong></em> when a longtime smoker presents with an ECG manifesting <em>at least</em> 2 or 3 of the first 5 findings in Figure 08.24-1.</li><li>Given the presence of 4 of these first 5 findings in <em>schematic</em> Figure 08.30-1 — it is certainly possible that such a patient might have frank <strong>RVH</strong> that simply is not yet manifesting a <em>predominant</em> R wave in lead V1. The ECG is simply <em>not</em> sensitive enough to reliably pick up all cases of RVH.</li><li>Remember that the adult LV is about 3 times as thick as the RV. In 3 dimensions — LV mass may normally be up to 10 times greater than normal RV mass. Development of RVH in an adult to the point that it <em>becomes</em> evident on ECG (*by a predominant R wave in lead V1 *— *as in *Figure 08.29-1) — is therefore a <em>late</em> sign.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>08.31 – Pediatric RVH: <em>A few Brief Thoughts …</em></strong></p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Interpretation of <em>pediatric</em> 12-lead ECGs is a specialty unto itself (<em>well beyond the scope of this ePub</em>). Most providers are only infrequently called upon to interpret pediatric ECGs. We therefore limit our comments here to discussion of a few basic concepts:</p><ul><li>ECG criteria for determining <em>atrial</em> abnormality (<em>RAA, LAA</em>) in children are similar to criteria that are used in adults (<em>Sections 08.19, 08.20</em>).</li><li>Very <em>different</em> criteria must be used for determining ventricular enlargement in pediatric patients. Depending on the <em>age</em> of the child being assessed — voltage criteria will vary greatly.</li><li>Detailed tables of pediatric norms are found in textbooks on this subject. Suffice it to say that QRS amplitude is often normally increased in the pediatric patient. Technical problems relating to accuracy of chest lead placement on the tiny chest of a small child when ECGs are recorded by nonpediatric providers are common. Determining whether QRS amplitude exceeds limits for age and satisfies pediatric ECG criteria for LVH is far from a simple matter. <em>Practically</em> Speaking — the child with symptoms <em>and/or</em> a murmur will be referred if there is any suspicion of chamber enlargement.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> As opposed to the difficulty for the <em>nonpediatric</em> provider in determining LVH — <strong><em>suspected</em> RVH</strong> is often far easier to surmise on ECG. In contrast to the situation just described for adults (<em>in which LV mass is normally up to 10 times greater than RV mass</em>) — RV mass is <em>comparable</em> to LV mass at birth, and tends to <em>remain</em> so for the first few years of life. As a result — a proportionately <em>smaller</em> increase in RV size is much more likely in children to produce a noticeable change in <em>net</em> electrical activity between the two ventricles. RVH is therefore much <em>easier</em> to diagnose in young children than it is in adults. Be aware of the following:</p><ul><li><em>Some</em> degree of <strong>RAD</strong> is common in young children.</li><li>The <strong>R wave</strong> may normally be <em><strong>taller</strong></em> than the S wave is deep in <strong>lead V1</strong> up to <em>about</em> <strong>age 5</strong>. By the time a child is 6 years old — the S wave in lead V1 will usually be deeper than the R wave in this lead is tall.</li><li>It is common to see <em>anterior</em> T wave inversion on the ECG of otherwise healthy children. This ECG phenomenon is known as a <strong><em>juvenile</em> T wave variant</strong>. Symmetric T wave inversion may extend to as far as lead V3 or V4 as a <em>normal</em> phenomenon in a young child or early adolescent. <em>Clinical correlation</em> is essential to avoid mistaking this normal T wave variant as a pathologic pattern (<em>Section 01.4</em>).</li><li>IF in doubt about “norms” — Refer to <em>age-specific</em> tables! Have a low threshold for consulting with someone having expertise in pediatric ECG interpretation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Pediatric</em> ECGs: <em>Is RVH Likely?</em></strong></p><p>Imagine the <em>schematic</em> ECGs shown in <strong>Figure 08.31-1</strong> and <strong>Figure 08.31-2</strong> were each obtained from a 2-year old child. <em>Is RVH likely?</em></p><p><strong>Figure 08.31-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG from a young child.

The presence of MAT is most often associated with <em>severe</em> pulmonary disease.</li><li>Several of the P wave forms that are seen in lead II are highly suggestive of <strong>RAA</strong> (<em>tall, peaked and pointed P waves in this lead</em>).</li><li>There is <em><strong>persistence</strong></em> of fairly <strong><em>deep</em> S waves</strong> in <em>lateral</em> precordial leads.</li><li><strong><em>Schamroth’s</em> Sign</strong> is present — as suggested by the <em>very</em> low amplitude r wave with flat ST-T wave in lead I (<em>Section 08.27</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Impression:</strong> The ECG in Figure 08.33-1 was obtained from a patient known to have COPD. The <em>combination</em> of ECG findings noted above should provide insight that the degree of pulmonary disease is severe, if not already associated with RVH and increased pulmonary pressures.</p><p><strong>08.34 – Acute <em>Pulmonary</em> Embolus</strong></p><p>The ECG is usually <em>not</em> a good tool for diagnosing **acute <em>pulmonary <em>embolism</em></em> (<em>acute PE</em>).

Failure to see any of the ECG signs in Section 08.34 does <em>not</em> rule out the possibility of acute PE IF history and clinical features suggest the diagnosis. <em>Chest CT is needed</em>.</li><li><em><strong>Sensitivity</strong></em> of the <strong>ECG</strong> for suggesting the possibility of acute PE is <em>better</em> with larger (<em>especially submassive</em>) PEs. One should <em>at the least</em> see <strong><em>sinus</em> tachycardia</strong> in such patients — often with <strong><em>nonspecific</em> ST-T wave changes</strong>. Large acute PE is commonly associated with other ECG signs — but these may be subtle and are generally nondiagnostic.</li><li>Be aware of the <em>clinical</em> significance of <strong>RV “strain”</strong>. The finding of <strong><em>anterior</em> T wave inversion</strong> (<em>in leads V1,V2,V3</em>) in an adult with <em>new-onset</em> dyspnea or pleuritic (<em>or atypical</em>) chest pain will much more often be due to <strong><em>acute</em> PE</strong> than to ischemic heart disease. This is especially true IF there is also <em>inferior</em> T wave inversion (<em>in II,III,aVF</em>) — as seen in <strong>Figure 08.35-1</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 08.35-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG illustrating a series of ECG findings that taken together are <em>highly</em> suggestive of <strong><em>acute</em> PE</strong> (<em>Pulmonary Embolism</em>) — especially when seen in a patient with <em>new-onset</em> dyspnea. Note <strong>RV <em>“strain”</em></strong> — in the form of <em>asymmetric</em> ST-T wave depression seen here in both <em>inferior</em> and <em>anterior</em> leads (<em>II,III,aVF;</em> and <em>V1,V2,V3</em>). In addition — there is <strong>RAD</strong> (<em>the QRS in lead I is markedly negative</em>) — <strong>RAA</strong> (<em>tall, peaked P wave in inferior leads</em>) — <strong><em>incomplete</em> RBBB</strong> (<em>rSr’ in V1; S waves in I,V6</em>) — and <strong>persistent <em>precordial</em> S waves</strong> that remain <em>deep</em> up to leads V5,V6.</p><p>**08.36 – FIGURE 08.36-1: <em>Should You Look for an <em>S1-Q3-T3?</em></em></p><p>Over the years — much attention has been focused on the diagnostic utility of recognizing an <strong><em>S1-Q3-T3</em> pattern</strong> as an ECG indicator of <strong><em>acute</em> PE</strong>.

To be valid — all 3 of these ECG indicators must be present.</p><p><strong>The S1-Q3-T3 Pattern: <em>Pros and Cons</em></strong></p><p>By itself — one can <em>not</em> rely on a <em>positive</em> S1-Q3-T3 sign as an ECG indicator of acute PE. This is because even in the <em>best</em> of studies — <em>both</em> sensitivity and specificity of a <em>positive</em> S1-Q3-T3 sign for <em>acute</em> PE is poor. That is — Failure to see this sign <em>in NO way</em> rules out the possibility of <em>acute</em> PE.</p><ul><li>More often than not — you will <em>not</em> see an S1-Q3-T3 sign <em>despite</em> even large <em>acute</em> PE.</li><li>We have seen the S1-Q3-T3 sign <em>many times</em> in completely <em>healthy</em> and <em>asymptomatic</em> adults! Clearly — these patients do <em>not</em> have <em>acute</em> PE.</li><li><strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> Recognition of a <strong><em>positive</em> S1-Q3-T3 pattern</strong> <em>may</em> help in the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> PE — IF the <em>positive</em> S1-Q3-T3 pattern is present in association with <em>other</em> suggestive ECG signs and the <em>“right”</em> clinical history.

Other ECG findings suggestive of <strong><em>acute</em> PE</strong> given the history include: <strong>i)</strong> Sinus tachycardia; <strong>ii)</strong> RBBB; <strong>iii)</strong> <em>diffuse</em> ST-T wave changes; and <strong>iv)</strong> ST elevation in lead aVR (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Clinical Impression of Figure 08.38-2:</strong> We emphasize — that one can <em>not</em> rule out the possibility of acute <em>anterior</em> STEMI from the ECG shown in Figure 08.32-2.

We fully explore this <em>advanced</em> concept in Sections 09.31-through-09.40. In the meantime — We suggest <em>not</em> being overly concerned about the ECG appearance in lead aVR:</p><ul><li>For the most part — assessment of lead aVR is <em>not</em> essential to the basics of ECG interpretation (<em>assuming the leads are on correctly and there is no dextrocardia</em>).</li><li><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> ECG appearance in <strong>lead aVR</strong> may assist in assessing not only technical errors — but <em>also</em> narrow and wide-complex tachycardias; acute coronary syndrome from multivessel or left main disease; pericarditis; pulmonary embolism; and more (<em>See Sections 09.31-through-09.40</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.2 – <em>Septal</em> Depolarization: <em>Reason for Normal Septal Q Waves</em></strong></p><p>In Section 05.7 — We introduced the concept of <strong>normal <em>septal</em> activation</strong>. Normally — the very first part of the ventricles to depolarize (<em>after the impulse passes through the AV node and Bundle of His</em>) — is the <strong><em>left</em> side</strong> of the <strong><em>ventricular</em> septum</strong>. As a result — septal depolarization <strong><em>normally</em> moves</strong> from <em><strong>left-to-right</strong></em> (<em>red arrow pointing left-to-right in</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 09.2-1).</p><ul><li>As a result of this initial <em>left-to-right</em> direction of <em>septal</em> depolarization — <strong><em>left-sided</em> leads</strong> (<em>I,aVL; V4,V5,V6</em>) normally see <em>initial</em> ventricular activation as moving <em>away</em> — which is why <strong>small <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> are often <em>normally</em> seen in one or more of the <em>lateral</em> leads (<strong>Panel A</strong>).</li><li>In contrast — <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> (<em>V1,V2</em>) normally view <em>initial</em> ventricular activation as coming <em>toward</em> the site on the chest where these leads lie. This explains why a <strong>small <em>initial</em> r wave</strong> is commonly seen in <strong><em>leads</em> V1, V2</strong> (<em>See lead V1 in</em> <strong>Panel A</strong>). This initial small r wave represents <em>septal</em> depolarization. It is <em>lost</em> when there is <em>septal</em> infarction (<em>See</em> Figure 09.3-1 — <em>in Section 09.3</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.2-1:</strong> Normal <em>septal</em> activation (<strong>A</strong>) vs LBBB (<strong>B</strong>). Septal activation normally begins on the <em>left</em> side of the septum — and travels left-to-right (<em>red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel A</strong>). As a result — one normally sees a small r wave in right-sided leads (<em>V1,V2</em>) and small, narrow q waves in one or more of the lateral leads (<em>I,aVL; V4,V5,V6</em>). <strong>RBBB</strong> does <em>not</em> change these findings (<em>since the right bundle branch travels down the right side of the septum</em>). In contrast — <strong>LBBB</strong> <em>reverses</em> the direction of septal activation (<em>red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong>). As a result — one should <em>never</em> normally see a septal q wave in a <em>lateral</em> lead with LBBB, <em>unless</em> there has been <em>septal</em> infarction (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>What Happens with BBB?</strong></p><p>Since the <strong>RBB</strong> (<em>Right Bundle Branch</em>) travels down the <em>right</em> side of the septum — the initial <em><strong>left-to-right</strong></em> direction of <em>normal</em> septal depolarization does <em>not</em> change when there is <strong>RBBB</strong> (<em>Section 05.7</em>).</p><ul><li>In contrast — with <strong>LBBB</strong>, the normal <em>left-to-right</em> direction of septal activation will <em>reverse</em> because the block with LBBB <em>prevents</em> the initial vector of septal activation from starting on the left (<strong>Panel B</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 09.2-1). As a result — ventricular activation with <strong>LBBB</strong> moves almost entirely from <em><strong>right-to-left</strong></em>. This explains why septal q waves should <em>not</em> normally be seen with LBBB in <em>lateral</em> leads (<em>Sections 05.6-through-05.9</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.3 – <em>Precordial</em> Lead Appearance: <em>What is Normal?</em></strong></p><p>In <strong>Figure 09.3-1</strong> — We illustrate normal <em>precordial</em> lead appearance by means of a <em>schematic</em> cross-sectional (<em>transverse</em>) view of the heart within the thorax:</p><ul><li>The <em><em>small</em> black <em>arrow</em></em> in Figure 09.3-1 schematically depicts the direction of normal septal depolarization (<em>which moves from left-to-right</em>).</li><li>The <em><em>large</em> red <em>arrow</em></em> depicts the general direction of <strong>LV</strong> (<em>Left Ventricular</em>) depolarization (<em>which as seen in <em>Fig. 09.3-1</em> is to the left and posteriorly</em>).</li><li>The smaller <strong>RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricle</em>) — predominantly sees electrical activity as moving <em>away</em> from the right (<em>and toward the larger and thicker left ventricle</em>). This explains why the QRS complex in <strong><em>right-sided</em> precordial leads</strong> (<em>V1,V2</em>) is normally predominantly <em>negative</em> — whereas the QRS in <strong><em>left-sided</em> leads</strong> (<em>V5,V6</em>) is generally positive.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.3-1:</strong> Transverse (<em>cross-sectional</em>) view of the heart — illustrating <em>precordial</em> lead appearance in leads V1-through-V6. Note that transition occurs <em>between</em> lead V2-to-V4. There is <em><strong>overlap</strong></em> between leads viewing <em>septal</em> — <em>anterior</em> — and <em>lateral</em> precordial areas. Septal depolarization normally moves left-to-right (<em>small black arrow</em>). The major component of ventricular activation moves to the left and posteriorly (<em>large red arrow</em>) — which reflects the relative size and anatomic position of the left ventricle.</p><p><strong>FIGURE 09.3-1: <em>Key Clinical Points</em></strong></p><ul><li>Note that there is <em><strong>overlap</strong></em> in Figure 09.3-1 between leads viewing <em>septal</em> — <em>anterior</em> — and <em>lateral</em> precordial lead areas. That is — <strong>lead V2</strong> is both a septal and anterior lead; <strong>lead V4</strong> is both an anterior and lateral lead.</li><li><strong><em>Septal</em> depolarization</strong> (*the small black arrow in *Figure 09.3-1) goes *left-to-right. *The normal <em>small</em> initial <em>positive</em> deflection (<em>r wave</em>) in leads V1,V2 results from <em>septal</em> activation coming toward these <em>right-sided</em> leads. With **<em>septal <em>infarction</em></em> — this small <em>initial</em> r wave in leads V1,V2 is <em>lost</em>.</li><li>Small <strong>normal <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> — are commonly seen in one (<em>or more</em>) of the *<em><em>lateral <em>leads</em></em> (<em>I,aVL; V4,V5,V6</em>). This makes sense — since the <em><strong>left</strong></em></em>-to-*<em><strong>right</strong></em> direction of **<em>septal <em>activation</em></em> moves <em>away</em> from <em>left-sided</em> leads (*and therefore writes a *<em><strong>small q wave</strong></em>).</li><li>The area where the R wave <em>becomes</em> taller than the S wave (<em><strong>Transition</strong></em>) occurs normally in Figure 09.3-1. That is — the QRS is predominantly <em>negative</em> in lead V2 — it is <em>isoelectric</em> in V3 — and <em>positive</em> in V4 (<em>so <strong><strong>transition</strong></strong> occurs between leads V2-to-V4, which is normal</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.4 – <em>Basic</em> Lead Groups: <em>Which Leads look Where?</em></strong></p><p>It is essential to know <em>which</em> leads view <em>which</em> areas of the heart. The <em><strong>“trained eye”</strong></em> keys into specific **<em>Lead <em>Groups</em></em> (Figure 09.4-1):</p><ul><li>In Sections 03 and 07 — we introduced derivation and anatomic correlation for the 6 limb leads in the frontal plane. This includes the 3 **<em>inferior <em>leads</em></em> (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) — the 2 <strong><em>high-lateral</em> leads</strong> (<em>I,aVL</em>) — and the most remote (<em>right-sided</em>) lead, which is <strong>lead aVR</strong>. We expand on these relationships in <strong>Figure 09.4-1</strong>.</li><li>Think of the <em>electrical</em> viewpoint of <strong>lead aVL</strong> as <em>looking down</em> at the heart from perspective of the <em>left</em> shoulder. Thus, lead aVL views the heart’s electrical activity from <em>higher</em> perspective than <em>precordial</em> leads that are placed on the chest. <strong><em>Bipolar</em> lead I</strong> at <em>horizontal</em> perspective (<em>corresponding to 0 degree placement in Einthoven’s triangle</em>) — also views the heart’s electrical activity from <em>higher</em> perspective than is seen from precordial leads. This is why <strong>leads I</strong> and** aVL** are designated <strong><em>“high lateral”</em> leads</strong> — to be distinguished from <em>lower lying</em> lateral precordial leads (<em>V4,V5,V6</em>).</li><li>In contrast — Think of the <em>electrical</em> viewpoint of <strong>lead aVF</strong> as looking <em>straight up</em> from the <strong>F</strong>eet (<em>perpendicular in the frontal plane axis at +90 degrees</em>). The other 2 <strong><em>inferior</em> leads</strong> are <strong>lead II</strong> (<em>at +60 degrees</em>) and <strong>lead III</strong> (<em>at +120 degrees</em>).</li><li>The remaining 6 leads are the <strong><em>precordial</em> leads</strong>. Anatomic localization of these 6 chest leads is best understood by reviewing the landmarks used for <em>performing</em> an ECG (<em>Section 03.6</em>) in context with the <em>horizontal</em> plane view just discussed in Figure 09.3-1. This should explain ***septal ***(<em>V1,V2</em>) — ***anterior ***(<em>V2,V3,V4</em>) — and <em><strong>lateral</strong></em> (<em>V4,V5,V6</em>) <strong><em>precordial</em> lead</strong> viewpoints for these <em>unipolar</em> leads that view the heart’s electrical activity from perspective of their placement site on the chest.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.4-1:</strong> <em>Basic</em> Lead Groups. As suggested in Fig. 09.3-1 — there is <em><strong>overlap</strong></em> in the <strong><em>precordial</em> lead</strong> areas (<em><strong>lead V2</strong></em>* reflects both septal <em>and</em> anterior events; <strong><strong>lead V4</strong></strong> reflects both anterior <em>and</em> lateral events*).</p><p><strong><em>About</em> Lead aVR:</strong> — The most remote of the 12 standard leads is <strong>lead aVR</strong>. This <em>right-sided</em> lead views the heart’s electrical activity from the distant perspective of the <em>right</em> shoulder. Lead aVR is unique for providing a view that assesses the basal part of the interventricular septum. It is also unique in providing a <strong><em>mirror-image</em> view</strong> of ongoing electrical activity throughout the rest of the heart.</p><ul><li>Note that we do <em>not</em> assign a specific number of degrees to the vantage point for <strong>lead aVR</strong> (Figure 09.4-1). Instead — it suffices to think of this lead as providing a remote <em>right-sided</em> view. Lead aVR may show <strong><em>reciprocal</em> changes</strong> to what occurs in other areas of the heart. Diffuse ST depression in multiple leads from subendocardial ischemia in a patient with severe coronary disease — may therefore manifest <strong><em>mirror-image</em> ST elevation</strong> that is <em>only</em> seen in <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>This concept discussed in detail in Section 09.40</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**09.5 – R Wave Progression: *Where is Transition? ***</p><p>The <strong>“R”</strong> of our <em>suggested</em> <strong>Q-R-S-T</strong> memory aid — serves to remind us to assess <em>each</em> tracing for <strong>R Wave Progression</strong>. A typical sequence of R wave progression across the 6 precordial leads is illustrated in <strong>Figure 09.5-1</strong>, which is a <em>close-up</em> view taken from the lower part of Figure 09.3-1.</p><ul><li>Normally the <strong>R wave</strong> becomes <strong><em>progressively</em> taller</strong> as one moves across the precordial leads. The R wave often (<em>but not always</em>) <strong>“tops out”</strong> in lead V5 — and then drops off in amplitude by lead V6. These relationships are shown in Figure 09.5-1.</li><li>The easiest way to <em>quickly</em> describe evolution of the QRS waveform from a predominantly <em>negative</em> complex in V1,V2 — to a predominantly <em>positive</em> complex in more lateral precordial leads — is by commenting on the point of <strong>“Transition”</strong>, which indicates the leads <em>between which</em> the QRS becomes more positive than negative. Transition <em>normally</em> occurs between lead V2-to-V3 — or between V3-to-V4. In <strong>Figure 09.5-1</strong> — Transition occurs <strong><em>between</em> leads V2-to-V4</strong> (<em>since the QRS is predominantly negative in V2 — isoelectric in V3 — and clearly positive by V4</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.5-1:</strong> Close-up of the cross-sectional view shown in Figure 09.3-1 — in which <em>progression</em> of QRS complexes in the <strong><em>precordial</em> leads</strong> is shown. Note the <em>small</em> r wave in lead V1 and that there are small <em>septal</em> q waves in leads V5,V6. R wave amplitude <em>“tops out”</em> in V5; <em><strong>Transition</strong></em> is <strong>normal</strong> (<em>occurs between leads V2-to-V4</em>).</p><p><strong>Where is Transition?</strong></p><p>Determining the point of transition is easy. It is a highly <em>reproducible</em> determination — and <em>not</em> subject to <em>inter-interpreter</em> variability (<strong>Figure 09.5-2</strong>). In contrast — there is great variation in the way different interpreters evaluate an ECG for the adequacy of R Wave Progression (<em>Section 09.7</em>).</p><ul><li><strong>Transition</strong> is said to be <em><strong>Normal</strong></em> — IF it occurs <em>between</em> leads V2-to-V4 (<strong>Panel B</strong> in Figure 09.5-2). Regardless of r wave amplitude in the first few precordial leads — the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep by lead V3 or V4. In <strong>Panel B</strong> — transition occurs <em>between</em> leads V3-to-V4.</li><li>Transition is said to be <em><strong>Early</strong></em> — IF the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep by lead V2. This is the case in <strong>Panel A</strong> — in which transition occurs <em>between</em> leads V1-to-V2.</li><li>Transition is said to be <em><strong>Late</strong></em> — IF the point at which the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep is delayed to <em>after</em> lead V4. This is the case in <strong>Panel C</strong> — in which transition occurs <em>between</em> leads V4-to-V5.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.5-2:</strong> Transition in the precordial leads.

Subjectivity does <em>not</em> enter into the definition.</p><ul><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The point of <strong>transition</strong> is a <strong><em>descriptive</em> finding</strong>. The clinical significance of normal, early or late transition — will depend on <em>other</em> ECG parameters (<em>as will be discussed shortly</em>).</li><li>Our purpose for <strong><em>routinely</em> including</strong> assessment of <strong>R wave <em>progression</em></strong> and the point of <em><strong>transition</strong></em> in our <strong><em>Systematic</em> Approach</strong> (<em>= the <strong><strong>“R”</strong></strong> of Q-R-S-T Changes</em>) — is <em>not</em> to overlook the finding of a <em>disproportionately</em> tall R wave in lead V1. Careful assessment of precordial lead morphology should <em>also</em> pick up: <strong>i)</strong> any r’ that might be present in lead V1; and <strong>ii)</strong> any Q waves or <em>loss</em> of r wave that might occur in precordial leads (<em>Section 09.8</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>09.6 –</em> Old</em> Terminology: <em>R Wave Progression – CW, CCW Rotation</em>**</p><p>ECG description of precordial lead QRS appearance has evolved over time.

These terms are <em>no longer</em> actively used. We find these terms confusing — because they are based on the unexpected premise of an observer standing at the feet of the patient <em>looking upward</em> to envision precordial lead progression of R wave amplitude. We suggest you <em><strong>ignore</strong></em> the terms <em><strong>“clockwise”</strong></em> and <strong><em>“counterclockwise”</em> rotation</strong>, which do <em>not</em> contribute to meaningful ECG interpretation.</p><ul><li>In contrast — We have kept the term <em><strong>“R Wave Progression”</strong></em> (<em>RWP</em>) in our ECG vocabulary, because this term remains <em>ingrained</em> in the minds of many ECG interpreters.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> Perspective:</strong> It is better to determine <em>precordial</em> lead <em><strong>“Transition”</strong></em> than to worry about R wave “progression”. The point of transition much more <em>reproducibly</em> describes what occurs in the transverse plane (<em>Section 09.5</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.7 – FIGURE 09.7-1: <em>Poor R Wave Progression</em></strong></p><p>Given continued reference by clinicians to “R wave progression” as a component of ECG interpretation — it is essential to appreciate what is meant by the term, <strong>“PRWP”</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>PRWP</strong> (<em>Poor R Wave Progression</em>) — is said to exist IF the R wave does <em>not</em> progressively increase as one moves across the precordial leads. A number of conditions may be associated with <strong>PRWP</strong>. We list these in Figure 09.7-1. The problem is that many of the entities on this list are <strong><em>clinical</em> “opposites”</strong> (ie, <em>RVH</em> vs <em>LVH</em>; <em>normal variant</em> vs <em>myocardial infarction</em>). Clinical utility of a term that <em>fails</em> to distinguish between opposites is limited.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> Perspective:</strong> The term “PRWP” is clearly suboptimal. That said, <em>despite</em> its shortcomings — the designation <strong>“PRWP”</strong> <em>remains</em> in active use. Specific indication of <em>which</em> precordial leads manifest Q waves (<em>or QS complexes</em>) — and noting the area of <em>transition</em> is far better. Nevertheless — You’ll want to be aware of the entities commonly associated with PRWP (<strong>Figure 09.7-1</strong>):</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.7-1:</strong> Common causes of <em><strong>“PRWP”</strong></em> — which is said to exist if the R wave does <em>not</em> become <em>progressively</em> taller as one moves across the precordial leads (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>09.8 – FIGURE 09.8-1: <em>Anterior MI vs Lead Placement Error?</em></strong></p><p>Technical mishaps and lead placement errors were reviewed in Section 03. Awareness of these technical pitfalls is especially relevant in assessing <em>precordial</em> lead R wave progression. For example — Examine the precordial lead sequence shown in Panel A of Figure 09.8-1.</p><ul><li>Does the precordial lead sequence in <strong>Panel A</strong> make sense? If not — <em>What might be the cause</em> of the problem?</li><li><strong>HINT:</strong> Be sure to look <em>not only</em> at R wave progression — but <em>also</em> at T wave progression in the precordial leads shown in <strong>Panel A</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.8-1:</strong> <em>Precordial</em> lead R wave progression in <strong>Panel A</strong> does <em>not</em> make sense — because there is abrupt <em><strong>loss</strong></em> and <em><strong>return</strong></em> of** r wave** <em>between</em> V1-to-V3. Note also what happen to T wave morphology as one moves from V1-to-V2-to-V3 in <strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.8-1:</strong> When R wave progression is “normal” — there is <em>gradual</em> increase in R wave amplitude as one moves across successive <em>precordial</em> leads. This is <em>not</em> seen in <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 09.8-1:</p><ul><li>A <em>relatively</em> tall initial R wave is seen in lead V1.</li><li>There is <em><strong>loss of R wave amplitude</strong></em> between lead V1-to-V2.</li><li>R wave amplitude in Panel A <em>returns</em> by lead V3.</li><li>Although possible that abrupt <em><strong>loss</strong></em> and <em><strong>return</strong></em> of** r wave** in <strong>Panel A</strong> could be the result of isolated <em>anterior</em> infarction — it is far <em>more likely</em> to represent an <em><strong>error</strong></em> in <strong>lead placement</strong>. Loss and return of R wave amplitude is usually <em>not</em> nearly <em>so abrupt</em> when due to infarction.</li><li>Further support of lead placement error is forthcoming from assessment of changes in T wave morphology. <strong>T wave progression</strong> from lead V1-to-V3 in <strong>Panel A</strong> also does <em>not</em> make sense. Normally — the T wave may be negative, flat (<em>isoelectric</em>), or upright in lead V1. The T wave should <em>not</em> go from <em>positive</em> in lead V1 — to <em>negative</em> in lead V2 — to <em>positive</em> once more in lead V3 as it does in Panel A.</li><li><em><strong>Putting It All Together:</strong></em> The precordial lead sequence in <strong>Panel A</strong> would make much more sense IF lead V2 was really lead V1 — and lead V1 was really lead V2. This <strong>technical <em>lead placement</em> error</strong> is in fact the cause of the unusual (<em>and unrealistic</em>) R wave and T wave progression seen in Panel A. <strong><em>Correct</em> lead placement</strong> is shown in <strong>Panel B</strong>. R wave and T wave progression is now normal — with transition <em>between</em> lead V3-to-V4.</li><li><strong>PEARL:</strong> Another reason for <em>routinely</em> including assessment of <em>transition, R wave progression</em> and precordial lead appearance in our <strong><em>Systematic</em> Approach</strong> (<em>the <strong><strong>“R”</strong></strong> in Q-R-S-T Changes</em>) — is to <em>avoid</em> overlooking technical lead placement errors like the one in Figure 09.8-1.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.9 – FIGURE 09.9-1: <em>What is the Cause of PRWP?</em></strong></p><p>As we have emphasized — the designation <strong>PRWP</strong> (<em>Poor R Wave Progression</em>) lacks specificity. That is — <em>many</em> conditions may account for relatively <em>low</em> anterior r wave amplitude (<strong>Figure 09.7-1</strong>). The purpose of Section 09.9 and Section 09.10 is to illustrate how integration of the <strong><em>overall</em> ECG picture</strong> facilitates determining <em>which</em> of the entities listed in Figure 09.7-1 is likely to be operative.</p><ul><li>The <em>schematic</em> precordial lead sequences in <em>both</em> <strong>Panel A</strong> and <strong>Panel B</strong> of <strong>Figure 09.9-1</strong> qualify as manifesting “PRWP”. Contemplate <em>WHY</em> we label Panel A as suggestive of COPD — and Panel B as suggestive of lead placement error.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.9-1:</strong> PRWP due to COPD vs placement error (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.9-1:</strong> PRWP is clearly present in the <em>schematic</em> 12-lead ECG shown in <strong>Panel A</strong>. No more than a <em>tiny</em> initial r wave is seen in leads V1,V2 — and R wave amplitude <em>remains</em> small through to lead V6. Transition <em>never</em> occurs (ie,* the R wave never becomes taller than the S wave is deep*).</p><ul><li>The reason the <em>schematic</em> ECG in <strong>Panel A</strong> is <em>strongly</em> suggestive of <strong>COPD</strong> — is that <em>several</em> additional ECG signs of pulmonary disease are present. These include:** i)** RAD (<em>Right Axis Deviation</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> RAA (<em>Right Atrial Abnormality</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> persistent <em>precordial</em> S waves that are still deep in V5,V6 (<em>See Section 08.30 for Review of ECG findings with pulmonary disease</em>).</li><li>NOTE:* Despite* “PRWP” for the <em>precordial</em> lead sequence in Panel A — <strong><em>anterior</em> infarction</strong> is <em>far</em>*** less likely*** because: <strong>i)</strong> an r wave (<em>albeit a small r wave</em>) is present in <em>all</em> precordial leads; and <strong>ii)</strong> the <strong><em>overall</em> ECG picture</strong> in <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>strongly</em> suggests <strong>COPD</strong>.</li><li>In contrast to Panel A — the 6 <em>precordial</em> leads in <strong>Panel B</strong> strongly suggest <strong>lead <em>placement</em> error</strong>. Abrupt <em>loss</em> and <em>return</em> of r wave from V1-to-V3 is <em>not</em> a logical sequence for <em>normal</em> R wave progression — especially given rapid development of a <em>predominant</em> R wave by lead V4. Confirmation of technical error should be easy to establish by verifying chest lead placement and then <em>repeating</em> the ECG.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.10 – FIGURE 09.10-1: <em>QS in V1,V2 <em>vs</em> Anterior MI?</em></strong></p><p>Two final examples of PRWP are shown in Panels B and C of Figure 09.10-1.

This is in comparison with precordial lead sequences suggestive of <em>anterior</em> MI (<strong>Panel B</strong>) vs an <em>indeterminate</em> pattern showing a QS complex in leads V1,V2 but <em>not</em> in V3 (<strong>Panel C</strong>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.10-1:</strong> With <em>normal</em> R wave progression (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — there is <em>progressive</em> increase in R wave amplitude across <em>successive</em> precordial leads until transition occurs. In Panel A — the R wave “tops out” in lead V5 and transition occurs <em>between</em> V3-to-V4.</p><ul><li>Normally — the QRS complex in <strong>lead V1</strong> is predominantly <em>negative</em>, because ventricular depolarization is traveling <em>away</em> from this <em>right-sided</em> lead. There may (<em>or may not</em>) normally be a small upright <em>initial</em> r wave in lead V1. Thus, the fact that a QS (<em>entirely negative</em>) complex is seen in lead V1 of <strong>Panel A</strong> is completely consistent with <em>normal</em> ventricular depolarization.</li><li>Although tiny — a <em>small</em> r wave (<em>positive initial deflection</em>) is seen by <strong>lead V2</strong> of Panel A.</li><li>In contrast, in <strong>Panel C</strong> — a <strong>QS pattern</strong> is seen in <em>both</em> <strong>lead V1</strong> and <strong>V2</strong>. This may or may not be a “normal” finding. Instead, it could indicate: <strong>i)</strong> a <em>technical</em> lead placement error; or <strong>ii)</strong> <em>septal</em> infarction. Since there may not be any reliable way to distinguish between normal variant vs lead placement error vs prior <em>septal</em> infarction — We simply acknowledge,*** “QS in V1,V2; Suggest clinical correlation”*** in our interpretation.</li><li>Statistically — the odds are far greater (<em>approximately 4-to-1</em>) that <em>either</em> normal variant or lead placement error *rather than *septal infarction are the reason for a <strong>QS complex</strong> in <strong>V1,V2</strong> but <em>not</em> V3 (<em>as seen in</em> <strong>Panel C</strong>).</li><li>It is only when <em>no r wave at all</em> is seen in V1,V2 and V3 that prior anterior (<em>or anteroseptal</em>) infarction becomes more likely (<strong>Panel B</strong>).</li><li>Additional support that the precordial lead sequence in Panel B indicates prior <em>anteroseptal</em> infarction — is the finding of a <em>small-but-definite</em> q wave in lead V4 but <em>not</em> in leads V5,V6. If the initial <em>negative</em> deflection in lead V4 was a septal q wave — We would also expect to see <em>similar</em> small septal q waves in leads V5,V6.</li><li><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> The above comments regarding <em>clinical</em> implications of a QS complex in leads V1,V2,V3 hold true <em>only</em> when the QRS complex is narrow. QRS widening due to <strong>LBBB</strong> commonly produces QS complexes in anterior leads that are simply the result of the conduction defection and are <em>not</em> indicative of <em>anterior</em> infarction (<em>Section 05.8</em>).</li><li><strong>NOTE-2:</strong> There are 2 <em>other</em> potential reasons for PRWP with a <em>narrow</em> QRS complex that are <em>not</em> the result of prior infarction. These are: <strong>i) LVH</strong>; and <strong>ii) LAHB</strong>. Usually at least <em>some</em> r wave will be seen by lead V3 with these other conditions — though <em>not</em> always. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> It is sometimes extremely difficult to know with certainty the cause of PRWP when R waves in leads V1,V2,V3 are <em>either</em> very small or absent. <em>Clinical correlation is essential</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> It is insightful to appreciate the <em>physiologic</em> reason why R wave progression is often “poor” in the presence of LVH *and/or *LAHB.</p><ul><li><strong>LVH</strong> (<em>Left Ventricular Hypertrophy</em>) — produces an increase in leftward and posterior forces. When marked — these leftward and posterior forces may totally <em>predominate</em> over initial rightward and anterior forces seen in leads V1,V2,V3. The result is reduction in r wave amplitude in anterior leads. At times — there may even be elimination of any r wave at all in V1,V2,V3.</li><li><strong>LAHB</strong> (<em>Left Anterior HemiBlock</em>) — The bundle of conduction fibers in the LAH (<em>Left Anterior Hemifascicle</em>) lies slightly in front of (<em>anterior to</em>) fibers in the LPH (<em>Left Posterior Hemifascicle</em>). As a result — block in the LAH (<em>as occurs with LAHB</em>) results in an initial <em>posterior</em> direction for electrical activity that is first conducted over the intact LPH. The result may once again be reduction in r wave amplitude in the <em>anterior</em> leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.11 – FIGURE 09.11-1: <em>PRWP from LVH <em>vs</em> Anterior MI?</em></strong></p><p>Examine the 2 precordial lead sequences shown in Figure 09.11-1.

In addition — ST-T wave changes of LV “strain” are seen in lead V6.</p><ul><li>Both precordial lead sequences in Figure 09.11-1 manifest a <strong>QS complex</strong> in <strong>leads V1,V2</strong> (<em>red arrows</em>). The difference — is that a QS complex is also present in lead <strong>V3</strong> of <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>red arrow</em>) — whereas a small initial <em>positive</em> deflection (<em>r wave</em>) is seen in lead V3 of <strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>red circle</em>).</li><li>As emphasized in Section 09.10 — the ECG picture in <strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>QS in V1,V2 but not in lead V3</em>) is far more likely <em>not</em> to be due <em>anterior</em> infarction. We would therefore write the following as our interpretation: <em>“LVH and strain; <strong><strong>QS in V1,V2 of uncertain significance</strong></strong>; Suggest clinical correlation”</em>.</li><li>In contrast — the ECG picture in <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>QS in V1,V2 and in lead V3</em>) makes it more likely that <em>anterior</em> infarction has occurred. That said — QRS amplitude is so greatly increased, that loss of r waves in V1,V2,V3 could be the result of marked LVH. We simply can <em>not</em> know for sure on the basis of this single ECG tracing. We would therefore write the following as our interpretation: <em>“LVH and strain; <strong><strong>QS in V1,V2 and V3; possible prior anterior infarction;</strong></strong> Strongly suggest clinical correlation”</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Final Point:</strong> A <em>subtle-but-real</em> additional finding in Figure 09.11-1 is the presence of <em>at least</em> 2mm of <strong>ST elevation</strong> in leads V2,V3 in <em>both</em> Panel A and Panel B (<em>short red horizontal lines in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong>).</p><ul><li>This ST elevation should be noted. That said — We strongly suspect this ST elevation is <em>not</em> indicative of acute injury because: <strong>i)</strong> Shape of the ST elevation is concave up = <em>“smiley”</em> vs ST coving that is far more predictive of acute injury; and <strong>ii)</strong> the ECG picture in the anterior leads is the reciprocal (<em>mirror-image</em>) of what is seen in lead V6. This <em>mirror-image</em> picture of concave-up ST elevation in one or more anterior leads is often seen simply as a reflection of LVH in patients without acute infarction.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> R wave progression is a <em>descriptive</em> finding. There are <em>many</em> potential causes of PRWP (<em>which we listed in</em> Figure 09.7-1). Some of these causes are benign.

The purpose of this Section is to highlight instances when Q waves (<em>and associated T wave inversion</em>) may be a <em>normal</em> finding.</p><ul><li><strong>Normal <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> — are common. As reviewed in discussion of bundle branch block (<em>Section 05.7</em>) — Septal q waves are <em><strong>small</strong></em> and <em><strong>narrow</strong></em>. They arise because the first part of the ventricles to normally depolarize is the <em>left</em> side of the septum. As a result — <strong><em>left-sided</em> leads</strong> see the initial depolarization vector as moving <em>away</em> from the left as the septum depolarizes from left-to-right. This accounts for the <strong>normal <em>small</em> q wave</strong> that may commonly be seen in one or more of the <strong><em>lateral</em> leads</strong> (<em>= leads I-aVL-V4-V5-V6</em>) in <em>asymptomatic</em> individuals <em>without</em> heart disease. The reason we do <em>not</em> include normal <em>septal</em> q waves in Figure 09.12-1 is because their small and narrow dimensions makes it obvious that such q waves are <em>unlikely</em> to be pathologic.</li><li><strong>Lead aVR</strong> — is normally all negative (*negative P wave, QRS and T wave *— <em>as seen in</em> Figure 09.12-1). Global negativity for lead aVR is logical given the remote <em>right-sided</em> location of this unipolar lead (<em>the depolarization vector continually moves away from right-sided lead aVR under normal circumstances</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead V1</strong> in adults — typically shows a QS or rS complex <em>and</em> T wave inversion (Figure 09.12-1). A <strong>QS complex</strong> may normally <em>still</em> be seen in <strong>lead V2</strong> <em>without</em> this necessarily meaning there has been prior septal infarction (<em>Section 09.10</em>). However, by <strong>lead V3</strong> — at least <em>some</em> r wave should be seen under normal circumstances. Regarding <strong>T wave</strong> appearance in lead V1 — the T should normally be <em>upright</em> by lead V2 in adults. Persistent T wave inversion in <em>anterior</em> leads should prompt consideration of ischemia. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The situation is <em>different</em> in children — for whom <em>anterior</em> T wave inversion up to lead V3 (<em>or even V4</em>) may reflect a <strong>normal <em>juvenile</em> T wave pattern</strong> (<em>Section 01.4</em>).</li><li><strong>Leads III, aVL, aVF</strong> (<em>as in</em> Figure 09.12-1) — may all <em>normally</em> show T wave inversion and/or an <em>isolated</em> Q wave that is <em>not</em> the result of ischemia or infarction — provided that these findings are not also seen in neighboring leads (<em>See Section 09.13</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**09.13 – FIGURE 09.13-1: *Inferior Infarction/Ischemia? ***</p><p>To illustrate the concept of normal <em>isolated</em> Q waves/T inversion — Consider the 6 limb lead sequence shown in <strong>Figure 09.13-1</strong>. <em>Which</em> leads manifest Q waves?

Everything seen might <em>not</em> necessarily be abnormal — IF the patient was asymptomatic. On the other hand — IF this patient had a history of potentially <em>worrisome</em> chest discomfort, the findings in lead III would clearly be of concern. We emphasize the following:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Q wave</strong> is seen in <strong>lead III</strong> of Figure 09.13-1. Technically — this is a <strong>QS complex</strong>, since there is <em>no</em> R wave. Although this Q wave is not particularly deep (<em>it is only 2mm</em>) — given <em>lack</em> of any R wave, this Q wave (<em>QS complex</em>) portends the <em>same</em> clinical implications as would a larger or wider Q wave. That said — Q waves are <em>not</em> seen in the other 2 <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>leads II,aVF</em>).</li><li><strong>Figure 09.12-1</strong> tells us — that the finding of an <em>isolated</em> Q wave in lead III is <em>not</em> necessarily abnormal (<em>and is not necessarily indicative of prior infarction</em>).</li><li>There is fairly** deep <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion** in <strong>lead III</strong> (<em>especially in view of the small amplitude for the QRS complex in this lead</em>). IF this patient had <em>new-onset</em> chest discomfort — We would clearly be concerned about acute ischemia. That said — there is no more than <em>nonspecific</em> ST-T wave flattening in lead aVF and <em>no</em> real ST-T wave abnormality in the <em>other</em> inferior lead (= <em>lead II</em>). <strong>Figure 09.12-1</strong> tells us — that the finding of an <em>isolated</em> Q wave <em>and/or</em> T wave inversion in lead III (<em>as well as the nonspecific ST-T wave flattening seen in lead aVF</em>) is <em>not</em> necessarily ischemic IF there is no ST-T wave abnormality in lead II.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The T wave vector often follows fairly close behind the QRS vector. As a result — <em>isolated</em> T wave inversion in leads III, aVL or aVF is <em>less likely</em> to be ischemic IF the QRS complex is predominantly <em>negative</em> in the lead that manifests T wave inversion. This is the case for lead III in Figure 09.13-1.</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> We would note the following on our interpretation: <em>“Q wave with T inversion in lead III; nonspecific ST-T wave flattening in aVF; Suggest clinical correlation”</em>. All bets would be off IF this patient had <em>new-onset</em> chest discomfort — since absence of abnormality in lead II does <em>not</em> completely exclude the possibility of acute ischemia/infarction. But IF the patient was asymptomatic (<em>especially if a prior tracing was available and showed similar findings</em>) — We would strongly suspect that the ECG appearance in lead III was not indicative of ischemia/infarction.</li><li><strong><em>“Take-Home”</em> Point:</strong> Most of the time when Q waves/T inversion reflects ischemia or infarction — <em>neighboring</em> leads (<em>in this case lead II as well as leads III,aVF</em>) will show <em>similar</em> changes.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>What about the Q Waves in Leads I and aVL?</strong></p><p>Small narrow q waves are seen in leads I and aVL in Figure 09.13-1. This is a <em>descriptive</em> finding that we add to our interpretation at the time we assess for Q-R-S-T changes.</p><ul><li>These <strong>q waves</strong> in <strong>leads I</strong> and <strong>aVL</strong> of Fig. 09.13-1 are almost certainly <strong>normal <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> given their <em>small</em> size and occurrence in association with <em>no</em> ST-T wave abnormalities in these high lateral leads (<em>Section 09.12</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.14 – ST Elevation: <em>Shape/What is the Baseline?</em></strong></p><p><strong>09.15 – ST Elevation or Depression: <em>What is the Baseline?</em></strong></p><p>Determining ST-T wave changes is essential to ECG interpretation. We favor use of the **<em>PR <em>segment baseline</em></em> as the reference point for judging ST segment deviations (<em>elevation <em>or</em> depression</em>). The <strong>PR segment</strong> is the *<em><em>connecting <em>line</em></em> that extends from the <em><strong>end</strong></em> of the P wave — <em>until</em> the <em><strong>beginning</strong></em> of the QRS complex (<strong>Panel A</strong></em> in *Figure 09.15-1). With this reference point in mind — We define the following:</p><ul><li><strong>ST Elevation</strong> (Panel B) — IF the ST segment arises from <em>above</em> the PR segment baseline.</li><li><strong>ST Depression</strong> (Panel C) — IF the ST segment arises from <em>below</em> the PR segment baseline.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.15-1:</strong> Use of the PR segment baseline (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — to determine if there is ST elevation (<strong>B</strong>) or ST depression (<strong>C</strong>). Alternatively — <em>either</em> the T-P segment or some <em>combination</em> of PR and TP segments may be used as the baseline (<em>See text</em>). <strong>Panel D</strong> — shows the J-point <em>notching</em> that is characteristic of <em>early</em> repolarization (<em>Section 09.20</em>).</p><p>**<em>Clinical</em> Notes: **Given the importance of the ST segment baseline in determining ST-T wave deviations (<em>elevation or depression</em>) — it is important to appreciate the following caveat:</p><ul><li>The** PR segment baseline** — will be more difficult to see when the heart rate is faster. This is because the PR interval <em>shortens</em> with <strong>tachycardia</strong>. This makes it more challenging to determine a true “baseline” for the PR segment when the rate is fast. <strong><em>Other</em> situations</strong> in which assessing the PR segment may be problematic include: <strong>i)</strong> when there is artifact;** ii)** if there is baseline wander; and <strong>iii)</strong> when there is PR depression (<em>as may occur with acute pericarditis; atrial infarction; and in some normal variants</em>). Knowing what to use as the baseline for ST segment deviations is sometimes no easy task.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>An <em>Alternative</em> Baseline:</strong> — Some clinicians favor using the <strong>TP segment</strong> as the baseline for judging ST segment deviations (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 09.15-1). We feel this is appropriate and a matter of personal preference.</p><ul><li><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> Far <em>more</em> important than whether one selects the TP vs PR segment as the baseline — is to <strong>overview</strong> the <strong><em>entire</em> tracing</strong> to assess for baseline wander that may affect <em>whatever</em> baseline is selected.</li><li>When conditions are ideal (ie, <em>no baseline wander; no PR depression; all complexes in a lead look identical</em>) — it is <em>easy</em> to pick out the baseline (<em>and it probably doesn’t matter whether you chose the TP or PR as your reference point</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> Reality:</strong> Much of the time — the <em>optimal</em> situation of no baseline wander and perfect consistency from <em>one-beat-to-the-next</em> is simply <em>not</em> attainable. In such cases — We suggest surveying <em>all</em> 12 leads with goal to <em><strong>perceive</strong></em> a <strong>“Gestalt”</strong> (ie, <em>to get the best possible “feel” as to what seems to be the isoelectric baseline for the case at hand</em>). We’ll reinforce this concept through numerous clinical examples over remaining Sections in this ePub.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.16 – J-Point ST Elevation: <em>Recognizing the J-Point</em></strong></p><p>The <strong>J Point</strong> “joins”. It <em><strong>joins</strong></em> the <strong><em>two <em>“S’s”</em></em> (ie, <em>the <strong><strong>end</strong></strong> of the QR</em></strong>*S ***— *with the <strong><strong>beginning</strong></strong> of the <strong><strong>S</strong></strong>T segment *— <em>as shown in</em> <strong>Panel D</strong> <em>of</em> Figure 09.15-1). A distinct J point is <em>not</em> always seen (<em>since the QRS <em>and</em> the ST segment often imperceptibly blend into one another</em>).</p><ul><li>When it is seen — the <strong>J point</strong> is often **<em>slightly <em>elevated</em></em> (<em>with respect to the PR segment baseline</em>). This is often a **<em>normal <em>finding</em></em> — as will be discussed in detail in the sections on Early Repolarization (<em>Sections 09.20-through-09.23</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The J point may be ***notched ***— especially when seen in association with <em>benign</em> repolarization variants (Panel A <em>vs <em><strong>Panel B</strong></em> in</em> <strong>Figure 09.16-1</strong>).</p><ul><li>In contrast — it is <em>uncommon</em> for <em>acute</em> MI to show J-point notching (<em>although you may occasionally see notching with acute pericarditis</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.16-1:</strong> Comparison of a <em>normal</em> ST-T wave which shows <em>no</em> ST segment elevation (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — vs the typical J-point appearance (<em>red arrow</em>) of patients with normal repolarization variants (<strong>Panel B</strong>). As will be discussed under <em>Early</em> Repolarization (<em>Sections 09.20, 09.21</em>) — normal variants often manifest J-point notching and slight ST elevation. Note imperceptible <em>blending</em> of the normal ST segment and T wave in Panel A — as distinguished from the <strong>J-point <em>notch</em></strong> in Panel B that marks the end of the QRS complex and beginning of the ST segment (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>09.17 – SHAPE of ST Elevation: <em>More Important than Amount!</em></strong></p><p>A <em>KEY</em> principle to appreciate — is that the <em><strong>shape</strong></em> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> is <em>more</em> important than the <em>amount</em> of elevation (<strong>Figure 09.17-1</strong>). For example — <em>acute</em> MI may occasionally occur with <em>no more</em> than <em>minimal</em> ST elevation. There are <em>other</em> times — when ST elevation may be much more marked, yet <em>not</em> be due to an acute cardiac event. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Appreciation of <strong>ST segment <em>shape</em></strong> — in context with the clinical situation is essential for accurate interpretation.</p><ul><li>ST elevation with an <em>upward</em> concavity (ie, <em><strong>&ldquo;smiley&rdquo;</strong></em> <em>configuration</em>) is usually benign — especially when seen in an otherwise healthy, <em>asymptomatic</em> individual (<em>and especially when seen with <strong><strong>notching</strong></strong> of the <em><strong>J point</strong></em> in one or more leads</em>). This ECG picture represents the benign <em>normal</em> variant pattern known as <strong><em>early</em> repolarization</strong> (Figure 09.17-1).</li><li>In contrast — ST segment elevation with <em><strong>coving</strong></em> or a *downward *convexity (= <em><strong>&ldquo;frowny&rdquo;</strong></em> configuration) — is much more likely to be due to acute injury (<em>from ischemia/infarction</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.17-1:</strong> <em>Shape</em> of ST elevation is <em>more</em> important than amount. <em>Upward</em> concavity (***“smiley”-***<em>shape</em>) ST elevation is more likely to reflect the <em>benign</em> normal variant of <strong><em>early</em> repolarization</strong> (<em>especially if seen with J-point notching</em>). In contrast — <strong>coved</strong> (= <em>convex down or <strong><strong>“frowny”</strong></strong>-shape</em>) ST elevation is more likely to indicate ischemia/infarction (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>09.18 – HISTORY: <em>Importance of Clinical Correlation</em></strong></p><p>History is <em>ever</em> important in assessing the clinical significance of ST elevation. Although ST elevation with upward concavity (= <em><strong>&ldquo;smiley&rdquo;</strong></em> <em>configuration</em>) and J point <em><strong>notching</strong></em> will most often reflect a normal <em>repolarization</em> variant — this is <em>only</em> true IF the patient is <em>asymptomatic.</em></p><ul><li>In contrast — An <em>identical “smiley-shape”</em> ST pattern obtained from a patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest discomfort <em>must</em> be assumed acute until <em>proven</em> otherwise. IF ever in doubt — <em>Admit the patient</em> to the hospital! Look for <em>old</em> tracings to compare. <em>Repeat</em> the ECG within a <em>short</em> period of time. <em>Don’t move on</em> to your next assignment until you are comfortable that an acute ischemic process is <em>not</em> evolving.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is an <em>uncommon</em> form of repolarization variant that manifests an ST segment coving (<em>“frowny”</em>) morphology. The clue that this otherwise worrisome pattern is likely to be benign lies in the <strong>History:</strong> The patient is usually a young, healthy athlete (<em>often African-American</em>) — who is asymptomatic (<em>See</em> Figure 09.24-1 <em>in Section 09.24</em>). Having a prior tracing for comparison may be invaluable. <em>Without</em> a prior tracing — it might be <em>impossible</em> to distinguish this pattern from <em>acute</em> MI if the patient presented to the ED with chest discomfort. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> The <em><strong>History</strong></em>* is ever important!*</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.19 – FIGURE 09.19-1: <em>Early Repolarization <em>or</em> Acute MI?</em></strong></p><p>To solidify the concepts covered thus far — We present the 12-lead ECG shown in <strong>Figure 09.19-1</strong>. There is definite ST segment elevation in a number of leads.

Only the <strong><em>Clinical</em> Impression</strong> changes — depending on which of the above 3 clinical settings is operative.</p><p><strong>Figure 09.19-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm with ST elevation in a number of leads. <em>What</em> is the likely cause of ST elevation? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Descriptive</em> ANALYSIS:</strong> The rhythm in Figure 09.19-1 — is sinus at ~60/minute. The PR, QRS, and QT intervals are normal. We estimate the axis at +60 degrees. The sum of the S wave in lead V2 (<em>~3 large boxes = 15 mm</em>) plus the R wave in V5 or V6 (<em>~5 large boxes = 25 mm</em>) clearly <em>exceeds</em> 35. This amplitude amount satisfies <strong><em>voltage</em> criteria</strong> for <strong>LVH</strong> — provided the patient is <em>at least</em> 35 years old (<em>Section 08.1</em>).</p><ul><li><strong>QRST Changes</strong> — A <strong>Q wave</strong> and <strong>T wave inversion</strong> is seen in <strong>lead III</strong> — which as <em>isolated</em> findings may be normal (<em>Section 09.12</em>). There are small <em>septal</em> q waves in V5,V6. Transition is normal (<em>the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep between lead V2-to-V4</em>).</li><li>The most remarkable finding is <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong><em>multiple</em> leads</strong>. ST segments manifest an <em>upward</em> concavity (ie, <em><strong>”smiley”</strong></em> <em>configuration</em>). As seen in the <em>blow-up</em> of leads V5,V6 (<strong>Figure 09.19-2</strong>) — there is ***notching ***of the <strong>J-point</strong> (<em>arrow in lead V5</em>). The combination of <em>upward concavity</em> ST elevation in association with J-point <em>notching</em> — looks very much like the ***“smiley”-***<em>shape</em> ST segment appearance of **<em>early <em>repolarization</em></em> previously seen in <em>schematic</em> Figure 09.17-1.</li><li>Remarkably <em>absent</em> from the ECG in Figure 09.19-1 — is <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression that would be expected if infarction was acutely evolving.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.19-2:</strong> <em>Blow-up</em> of leads V5,V6 from Figure 09.19-1. The <em>upward</em> concavity (<em>“<strong><strong>smiley</strong></strong>”-shape</em>) ST segment in association with <strong><em>J-point</em> notching</strong> (<em>arrow</em>) is characteristic of <strong>ERP</strong> (<em><strong>E</strong></em><em>arly <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>epolarization <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>attern</em>). <em>Diffuseness</em> of this ST elevation on the 12-lead (Fig. 09.19-1) — <em>lack</em> of significant Q waves and <em>absence</em> of <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression <em>all</em> support ERP as the diagnosis.</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> IMPRESSION:</strong> The most important point to emphasize about this ECG — is that <strong><em>our</em> interpretation</strong> of <strong>Figure 09.19-3</strong> will vary tremendously depending on history and the <em>clinical</em> setting. <strong><em>Descriptive</em> Analysis</strong> <em>stays the same</em>. However, what we would do clinically will be <em>very</em> different:</p><p><strong><em>Scenario</em> #1:</strong> — IF the patient is an <strong><em>asymptomatic</em> 25-year old adult</strong>:</p><ul><li>Voltage criteria for LVH would <em>not</em> be satisfied in Figure 09.19-3 (<em>since the patient is less than 35 years old</em>).</li><li>We would interpret the ST elevation seen in multiple leads of this tracing as most consistent with <strong>ERP</strong> (<em><strong>E</strong></em><em>arly <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>epolarization <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>attern</em>) — since this young, <em>asymptomatic</em> adult manifests benign-appearing <em>concave up</em> ST elevation with: <strong>i)</strong> J-point point <em>notching</em> in at least several of the leads with ST elevation; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Lack</em> of significant Q waves; and <strong>iii)</strong> An* absence* of <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.19-3:</strong> We reproduce Figure 09.19-1. The likely significance of the diffuse ST elevation seen depends on the clinical setting (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Scenario</em> #2:</strong> — IF the patient whose ECG is shown in Figure 09.19-3 was a <em>young-to-middle-aged</em> adult with history of <em>recent</em> URI (<em>Upper Respiratory Infection</em>) and <strong><em>pleuritic</em> chest pain</strong>:</p><ul><li>We would actively <em>consider</em> the possibility of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> — because: <strong>i)</strong> ST elevation is seen in <em>multiple</em> leads (<em>I,II,III,aVF; V2-through-V6</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Infarction Q waves are <em>not</em> seen; and <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Reciprocal</em> ST depression is absent (<em>ECG findings of acute pericarditis are discussed in detail in Section 12.2</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Scenario</em> #3:</strong> — IF the patient was <em>older</em> with severe <strong><em>new-onset</em> chest pain</strong>:</p><ul><li>Voltage criteria for LVH now <em>would</em> be satisfied.</li><li>We would definitely contemplate the <em><strong>possibility</strong></em> of <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> (<em>ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</em>) — since there is <em>unmistakable</em> ST elevation in this patient presenting with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain.</li><li><strong>2-Things-To-Do</strong> — to assist in evaluation would be: <strong>i) <em>Repeat</em></strong> the <strong>ECG</strong> in a little while (<em>to see if there are any evolutionary changes</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> Look for a <strong><em>prior</em> ECG</strong> — so that you can determine IF the patient has early repolarization as a baseline finding.</li><li>We emphasize that several ECG features in Figure 09.19-3 are <em><strong>against</strong></em> this being an <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong>. These include: <strong>i)</strong> How <em>diffuse</em> the ST elevation is; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>upward</em> concavity shape with J-point notching; <strong>iii)</strong> the q waves seen are small and narrow; and <strong>iv)</strong> general <em>lack</em> of reciprocal ST depression. That said — <strong>the <em>onus</em> of proof <em>is on</em> us</strong> — and, there is a Q wave with T inversion in lead III — the ST segment takeoff in lead V3 is <em>straighter</em> than is usually seen with early repolarization — and patients with <em>baseline</em> ERP can develop <em>superimposed</em> acute infarction (<em>so the patient might have had a component of early repolarization prior to developing their acute infarction</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> We <em>need</em> to know the <em>clinical</em> setting in order to be able to interpret the ECG in Figure 09.19-3. Descriptive analysis will <em>stay the same</em> regardless of the history — but clinical interpretation will be vastly <em>different</em> depending on what the history is.</p><p><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Did you notice the <strong>S1-Q3-T3 pattern</strong> in Figure 09.19-3? It turns out that this ECG <em>was</em> obtained from a healthy, <em>asymptomatic</em> young adult and that the ST elevation was entirely due to <strong><em>early</em> repolarization</strong>.</p><ul><li>As emphasized in Section 08.36 — the <em>isolated</em> finding of an <strong>S1-Q3-T3</strong> pattern in an otherwise healthy individual may be normal. An S1-Q3-T3 is <em>only</em> helpful in the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> PE (<em>Pulmonary Embolus</em>) — IF the history is <em>“right”</em> and there are <em>other</em> suggestive ECG findings.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>09.20 – What is</em> EARLY</em> REPOLARIZATION?**</p><p>Having discussed the elements required for determining whether there is ST elevation — with emphasis on the importance of assessing ST segment <em>shape</em> plus the <em>clinical</em> history — we now explore further the entity known as <strong>ERP</strong> (<em><strong>E</strong></em><em>arly <strong><strong>R</strong></strong>epolarization <strong><strong>P</strong></strong>attern</em>).</p><ul><li>The term <strong>ERP</strong> — relates to a common ECG finding characterized by <strong>J-point abnormalities</strong> and <em>associated</em> <strong>ST-T wave changes</strong>. These features are shown in <strong>Figure 09.20-1</strong>:</li><li>Typically — there is J-point ST elevation with <em>upward</em> concavity (<strong>Panel A</strong>).</li><li>There may be frank <strong>notching</strong> — defined as an upward deflection near the end of the R wave downslope (<strong>Panel B</strong>).</li><li>Alternatively — there may be <strong>slurring</strong> (<em>without notching</em>) of the terminal portion of R wave downslope as it transitions into the ST segment (<strong>Panel C</strong>). Note that there is no more than minimal ST elevation in association with such slurring in Panel C.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.20-1:</strong> ECG features of <strong><em>early</em> repolarization</strong>. There is <em>concave up</em> ST elevation <em>(“smiley”-shape</em>) in at least <em>several</em> leads — often with <em>either</em> J-point notching <em>and/or</em> terminal R wave slurring in one or more of the leads that manifest ST elevation (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><em>09.21 –</em> Early</em> Repolarization: <em>Variations in the Definition</em>**</p><p>First described in the 1940’s — there are <em><strong>variations</strong></em> in <strong>how</strong> even the <strong>experts <em>define</em> “ERP”</strong>. Many imply that the entity is defined by J-point ST elevation of <em>characteristic</em> shape. Others include J-point abnormalities (<em>notching, slurring</em>) — even when there is no more than <em>minimal</em> associated ST segment elevation.</p><ul><li>Typically — there is at least <strong>1-2 mm</strong> of <strong><em>upward</em> concavity</strong> (“<em>smiley”-shape</em>)** ST segment elevation** with prominent <strong><em>upright</em> T waves</strong> in <em>at least</em> <strong>2 <em>contiguous</em> leads</strong>.</li><li>Some include <em>anterior</em> lead ST elevation within their definition of “ERP”. Others maintain that <strong><em>some</em> degree</strong> (<em>1-2mm</em>) of <strong><em>anterior</em> ST elevation</strong> (<em>in V2-to-V4</em>) is so common as to be a <strong><em>normal</em> finding</strong> (<em>and not indicative of ERP</em>).</li><li>The presence of 1-2mm <em>upward</em> concavity <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <em>either</em> <strong>inferior</strong> (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) or <strong>lateral</strong> (<em>I,aVL; V4,V5,V6</em>) <strong>lead areas</strong> is much <strong><em>less</em> common</strong> than <em>anterior</em> ST elevation – and – <em>clearly</em> satisfies criteria for “ERP”.</li><li><em>More than one lead area may be involved</em> with ERP. Occasionally there may even be <em>“global”</em> ST elevation (<em>in inferior, lateral, and anterior leads</em>) — which may understandably be <em>difficult to distinguish</em> from <em>acute</em> pericarditis.</li><li><strong>ECG <em>changes</em></strong> of <strong>ERP</strong> may be <em><strong>dynamic</strong></em>. They may come or go with <em>change</em> in body position (<em>from supine to standing</em>) — with activity (<em>they commonly disappear during exercise testing</em>) — and ERP may change over time (<em>especially if the patient becomes deconditioned or during illness</em>). <strong>CAVEAT:</strong> <em>Such</em> ST-T wave changes do <em>not</em> necessarily indicate ischemia or <em>acute</em> infarction!</li><li><strong><em>Other</em> Patterns</strong> of <strong><em>“repolarization variants”</em> exist</strong>.

Although there is shallow T wave inversion in lead aVL — this is probably a normal finding given predominant negativity of the QRS complex in this lead and lack of associated T inversion in other lateral leads (<em>Section 09.12</em>).</li><li><em><strong>Beyond-the-Core:</strong></em> Several <em>additional</em> ECG features in Figure 09.23-1 are present that <strong><em>favor</em> ERP</strong> (<em>rather than acute infarction</em>). These include the following: <strong>i)</strong> that precordial lead QRS amplitude is increased (<em>increased R wave amplitude in V1-through-V4 is less likely when there is anterior infarction</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> that the R wave is <em>already</em> fairly tall by V2,V3 (<em>delayed transition is commonly seen with anterior infarction</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> that the QT is definitely <em>not</em> long (<em>acute ischemia/infarction commonly results in at least some lengthening of the QT interval</em>). That said — the <strong><em>clinical</em> history</strong> — a <strong><em>repeat</em> ECG</strong> and availability of <strong><em>prior</em> ECGs</strong> for <em><strong>comparison</strong></em> will ultimately dictate the course.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Where</em> the patient presents for evaluation <em>does</em> have a role in determining the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital. Given <em>identical</em> clinical features and a <em>similar</em> ECG — the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital appears to be <em>more</em> IF the patient is seen in an ED (<em>Emergency Department</em>). This is because: <strong>i)</strong> Emergency care providers are less likely to know the patient and the previous medical history (<em>and also less likely to have a prior ECG available for comparison</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> There appears to be a <em>tendency</em> toward <em><strong>self-selection</strong></em>, whereby patients with more acute cardiac disorders <em>somehow</em> know to go to the ED rather than the office. That said — <em><strong>the onus remains on us</strong></em> to assume the worst scenario (ie, <em>ACS = Acute Coronary Syndrome</em>) until we can be comfortable that it is safe to send the patient home. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> The clinical history is needed in order to know what to do for a patient presenting with the ECG shown in Figure 09.23-1. While a diagnosis of ERP <em>without</em> need for admission would be reasonable IF the history was <em>not</em> of concern — a very <em>different</em> conclusion would be reached IF symptoms sounded acute.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>T Wave Peaking:</strong> The final point to make from the ECG in Figure 09.23-1 — is that <strong><em>repolarization</em> variants</strong> that occur in otherwise healthy adults may take on a number of different forms. These include: <strong>i)</strong> Upward concavity (<em>“smiley”-shape</em>) ST elevation (<em>Sections 09.20 and 09.21</em>); <strong>ii) T wave peaking</strong> (Figure 09.23-1); and <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Other</em> patterns (<em>See Section 09.24</em>).</p><ul><li>The ECG finding of <strong><em>peaked</em> T waves</strong> should prompt consideration of <strong>3 entities</strong>. These include: <strong>i)</strong> Hyperkalemia; <strong>ii)</strong> Ischemia; and <strong>iii)</strong> A <strong>normal <em>repolarization</em> variant</strong>. Morphologic appearance, clinical correlation and comparison with <em>prior</em> tracings may be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.</li><li><em>Against</em> hyperkalemia in Figure 09.23-1 — is that T waves are <em>not</em> pointed; the ascending and descending limbs of the T waves are <em>not</em> symmetric; and the base of the T waves is <em>not</em> narrow (<em>Section 11.3</em>). Patients with hyperkalemia almost always have either a <em>predisposing</em> medical illness (<em>severe renal disease; acidosis; dehydration; multi-organ failure</em>) or are taking <em>potassium-retaining</em> medications.</li><li><strong><em>Posterior</em> ischemia</strong> — may manifest as <em>anterior</em> T wave peaking. That said, ischemia is highly <em>unlikely</em> — IF T wave peaking is diffuse and the patient is a younger adult who is <em>not</em> having chest pain (<em>as occurs in this case</em>).</li><li><strong>T wave peaking</strong> (*as seen in *Figure 09.23-1) — is a <em>descriptive</em> finding. We presume it is due to a <strong>benign <em>repolarization</em> variant</strong> <em>only after</em> we are comfortable that it is <em>not</em> due to hyperkalemia or ischemia.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.24 – FIGURE 09.24-1: <em>Acute MI or Repolarization Variant?</em></strong></p><p>Consider the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 09.24-1</strong>. <em>No history is given</em>.</p><ul><li>Is this ECG likely to reflect ACS (<em>Acute Coronary Syndrome</em>) with possible recent infarction?</li><li>Can you think of a clinical scenario whereby the ECG shown in Figure 09.24-1 might be a <em>normal</em> variant?</li><li><em>Extra Credit:</em> Is there LVH?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.24-1:</strong> No clinical history is given. Has there been <em>recent</em> infarction (<em>or ongoing acute ischemia</em>)? Does this patient have LVH? What information is needed to answer these questions? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.24-1:</strong> Descriptive analysis of this ECG reveals the rhythm to be sinus arrhythmia. Intervals are normal. There is <strong><em>marked</em> LAD</strong> (<em>Left Axis Deviation</em>) that satisfies criteria for <strong>LAHB</strong> (<em>Left Anterior HemiBlock</em>) — as the <em>net</em> QRS deflection in lead II is predominantly negative (<em>Section 07.13</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Chamber</em> Enlargement</strong> — Did you notice there is <strong><em>half</em> standardization</strong>? The standardization mark is seen at the very beginning of the tracing — and is only 1 <em>large</em> box (<em>5mm</em>) tall (<em>red rectangle in lead II of</em> <strong>Figure 09.24-2</strong>). This means that amplitude of the P wave and QRST complex has been reduced in half in order to fit on the ECG recording paper (<em>Section 08.5</em>). Therefore — <strong>S wave</strong> depth in <strong>lead V2</strong> is <em>not</em> 12 mm, but <strong>24 mm</strong> — and <strong>R wave</strong> amplitude in <strong>lead V5</strong> is <em>not</em> 10 mm, but <strong>20 mm</strong>! Therefore — <strong><em>voltage</em> criteria</strong> for <strong>LVH</strong> will be satisfied IF the patient is 35 years old.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.24-2:</strong> The ECG shown in Figure 09.24-1 is reproduced — highlighting that there is <strong><em>half</em> standardization</strong> (<em>red rectangle in lead II; open arrows at the very beginning of leads I and III</em>). As a result — <em><strong>voltage</strong></em> for <strong>LVH</strong> is present IF this patient is 35 years old. Are you concerned about the <strong>ST-T waves</strong> in the <em>inferior</em> leads and especially in leads V3-through-V6 (<em>red arrows</em>)?</p><p><strong>Assessment of QRST Changes:</strong> No Q waves are present in Figure 09.24-2 — as <em>small-but-real</em> initial r waves are seen in each of the inferior leads. Transition occurs early due to a surprisingly tall R wave in lead V2. That said — the most concerning finding on this ECG is <strong>ST coving</strong> with <strong><em>slight</em> ST elevation</strong> and <strong>T wave inversion</strong> in <em>multiple</em> leads (<em>red arrows in precordial leads</em>).</p><ul><li>IF this patient was older with a history of <em>new</em> chest pain — this ECG would look like an <em>acute</em> evolving MI. It turned out that the patient in this case was a young adult athlete with <em>no</em> heart disease who had this ECG done as part of a pre-participation sports exam. Thus, the ST-T wave changes seen are most likely to represent an <em>unusual</em> <strong><em>repolarization</em> variant</strong>. In view of this benign clinical setting — there is no evidence for acute ischemia. **<em>Bottom <em>Line:</em></em> Be aware that there are a number of different repolarization variants that may be seen on the ECG of <em>normal</em> subjects. <em><strong>History is everything!</strong></em></li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> If we were evaluating this asymptomatic young adult athlete in the office as part of a <em>pre-participation</em> exam — We would recommend an <strong>Echo</strong> to <em>rule out</em> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy given early transition with prominent septal forces (ie, <em>disproportionately tall R waves in leads V2,V3</em>). If physical examination and the Echo were normal — there would be no reason not to allow full participation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.25 – ST Segment Depression</strong></p><p>As discussed in Section 09.15 — We favor use of the **<em>PR <em>segment baseline</em></em> as the reference point for judging ST segment deviations (<em>elevation <em>or</em> depression</em>). The <strong>PR segment</strong> is the *<em><em>connecting <em>line</em></em> that extends from the <em><strong>end</strong></em> of the P wave — <em>until</em> the <em><strong>beginning</strong></em> of the QRS complex (<strong>Panel A</strong></em> in *Figure 09.25-1). Using the PR baseline as our reference point — We define the following:</p><ul><li><strong>ST Elevation</strong> (Panel B) — IF the ST segment arises <em>above</em> the PR baseline.</li><li><strong>ST Depression</strong> (Panel C) — IF the ST segment arises <em>below</em> the PR baseline.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.25-1:</strong> Use of the PR segment baseline (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — to determine if there is ST elevation (<strong>B</strong>) or ST depression (<strong>C</strong>). Alternatively — <em>either</em> the T-P segment or some <em>combination</em> of PR and TP segments may be used as the baseline (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Caveats: <strong>The</strong> PR segment baseline</strong> is more difficult to see when the heart rate is faster. This is because the PR interval <em>shortens</em> with tachycardia. This makes it more challenging to determine a true “baseline” for the PR segment when the rate is fast.</p><ul><li><em>Other</em> situations in which assessing the PR segment may be problematic include presence of artifact and baseline wander. Knowing what to use as the baseline for ST segment deviations is sometimes no easy task.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Instead of the PR segment — some clinicians favor the <strong>TP segment</strong> as the baseline to use for judging ST segment deviations (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 09.25-1). <em>Either</em> approach is acceptable — and, when conditions are ideal (ie, <em>no artifact; no baseline wander; all complexes in a lead look identical</em>) — determining the baseline is easy (<em>and it doesn’t really matter whether you select the TP, PR, or some combination of the two as your reference point</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.26 – LIST #4: <em>Causes of ST Depression</em></strong></p><p>There are <strong><em>over</em> 50 causes</strong> of ST segment depression on ECG. Many of these causes are <em>cardiac-related</em> — but there are also many <em>non-cardiac</em> causes. Among the many <strong><em>non-cardiac</em> causes</strong> are hyperventilation; temperature extremes (<em>excessive heat or cold exposure</em>); anxiety or emotional stress; anemia; tachycardia; sleep deprivation; pulmonary disease; electrolyte abnormalities; central nervous system disorders; certain medications; and severe medical illness (<em>among others</em>). <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Rather than commit to memory an <em>exhaustive</em> list of conditions predisposing to ST segment depression — it suffices to appreciate the variety of entities that may produce changes on ECG. <strong>Remember:</strong> <em>Many of these conditions are non-cardiac</em>.</p><ul><li>We <em>simplify</em> recall of those clinical entities predisposing to ST depression that we feel are <em>most</em> important to remember with our <strong>LIST #4</strong> in** Figure 09.26-1**.</li><li>In general — <em><strong>causes</strong></em> of <strong>T wave abnormalities</strong> (<em>including T wave flattening or frank T wave inversion</em>) are <em>similar</em> to potential causes of ST segment depression.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.26-1:</strong> <em>Common</em> Causes of ST Depression = <strong>LIST #4</strong>.

Note the initial <em>slow</em> sagging of the ST segment with “strain” (<em>black arrow</em>) — with more rapid return to the baseline (<em>Section 08.9</em>). “Strain” is more likely to be the cause of ST depression when voltage for LVH is present — although occasionally, there may be ST-T wave changes suggestive of “strain” <em>without</em> accompanying voltage (<em>Section 08.10</em>).</li><li><strong>&ldquo;RV strain&rdquo;</strong> — is suggested IF the picture in <strong>Panel A</strong> of Fig. 09.27-1 is seen in **<em>right-sided <em>leads</em></em> (<em>II,III,aVF <em>or</em> V1,V2,V3</em>) in a patient with <strong>RVH</strong> (<em>Sections 08.28 and 08.29</em>).</li><li>Use of <strong>Digoxin</strong> may <strong><em>affect</em> ST-T waves</strong> in one of <strong>3</strong> ways: <strong>i)</strong> there may be <strong><em>“scooped”</em> ST depression</strong> in multiple leads (*that simulates an inverted ice cream cone, as in <em><strong>Panel D</strong></em> of *Figure 09.27-1); or <strong>ii)</strong> Digoxin “effect” may produce a **<em>&ldquo;strain&rdquo;-like <em>pattern</em></em> (<em>identical to</em> <strong>Panel A</strong>); or <strong>iii)</strong> Despite use of Digoxin — ST-T waves may be unaffected. It is of interest that the serum Digoxin level does <em>not</em> correlate well with ST-T wave appearance in a patient taking this drug. Thus, a patient may manifest classic “scoopies” (<em>scooped ST depression with a short QT interval in multiple leads</em>) — yet be on no more than a <em>low</em> dose of the drug. In contrast, another patient may have toxic serum levels of Digoxin — yet manifest <em>no</em> ST-T wave abnormalities at all. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> ST-T wave appearance does <em>not</em> predict which patients have Digoxin toxicity.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> — is the remaining pattern of ST-T wave change in Figure 09.27-1. We label this pattern as, <strong>“NS ST-T Abns.”</strong> (= <em><strong>N</strong></em>*on-<strong><strong>S</strong></strong>pecific ****ST-T ***<em>wave <strong><strong>A</strong></strong>bnormalities</em>) — since such ST flattening <em>and/or</em> slight depression does <em>not</em> suggest any <em>specific</em> cause. Instead — <em>any</em> of the <em>more</em> than 50 potential causes of ST-T wave abnormalities may be contributing to the appearance of this pattern. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> The ST-T wave is <em>not</em> normal — but the change that we see is <em><strong>non-specific</strong></em> in that we <em>don’t</em> know the cause.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>09.28 – FIGURE 09.28-1: <em>What is the Cause(s) of ST Depression?</em></strong></p><p>It is easiest to illustrate the concepts covered in Sections 09.26 and 09.27 by a clinical case.

In this case — any (<em>probably several</em>) of the entities in <strong>List #4</strong> may be operative, since this patient has chest pain (<em>possible ischemia</em>) — she has heart failure and LVH (<em>LV “strain” is probably present</em>) — she is on lots of drugs (<em>possibly digoxin; probably diuretics predisposing to low K+/Mg++</em>) — and she is tachycardic (<em>SVT rhythm at ~180/minute</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**<em>“Take-Home” <em>Point:</em></em> The ECG in Figure 09.28-1 provides an excellent example of how best to utilize <strong>List #4</strong>. We interpret the 12-lead tracing in the usual systematic fashion. Recognition of <strong><em>diffuse</em> ST depression</strong> should set off the “light bulb” to recall the entities on List #4. Clinical correlation with the history given allows us to predict a likely contribution from each of the entities on the list.</p><p><strong>09.29 – Recognizing <em>Subtle</em> ST Changes: <em>ST Segment Straightening</em></strong></p><p>Consensus among expert electrocardiographers is lacking regarding the definition of a “normal” ECG. Much of this relates to semantics — since <em>minor</em> ST-T wave abnormalities generally provide no more than a <em>nonspecific</em> suggestion to potential etiologies. That said — We feel it is important to <em><strong>hone in</strong></em> on recognizing even <em>minimal</em> abnormalities, if for no other reason than to let those reading our interpretation be aware that <em>we saw the abnormality</em> in question but did <em>not</em> think it clinically important for the case at hand.</p><ul><li>The above said — there <em>are</em> times when even <em>minimal</em> ST-T wave changes may have clinical relevance. In addition — <em>routine</em> attention to <strong>recognizing <em>subtle</em> ST-T wave changes</strong> will go a <em>long</em> way toward improving one’s ECG interpretation ability.</li><li>For example — <em>What is the difference</em> between the ST segment shown in <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>vs</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> in Figure 09.29-1? Is the admittedly <em>subtle</em> difference in ST-T wave appearance between these two complexes likely to be of clinical significance? If so — <em>How?</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.29-1:</strong> Compare the ST segment in <strong>Panel A</strong> with <strong>Panel B</strong>. <em>What is the difference?</em> Is this likely to be clinically significant? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.29-1:</strong> The <strong>ST-T wave</strong> in <strong>Panel A</strong> is <em><strong>normal</strong></em>. Note the <em>smooth</em> contour at the point of transition between the end of the S wave and the beginning of the ST segment. Note an equally <em>smooth</em> contour at the end of the ST segment and the point where the ascending limb of the T wave begins.</p><ul><li>In contrast — Note the <strong><em>sharp</em> angle</strong> in <strong>Panel B</strong> at the point where the straight (<em>flat</em>) ST segment ends and the ascending limb of the T wave begins (<em>red arrow</em>). While admittedly “splitting hairs” — the ST-T wave in Panel B is <em>not</em> normal. Instead — there is <strong><em>nonspecific</em> ST segment straightening</strong> (ie, <em>loss of that smooth transition between end of the ST segment <em>and</em> the beginning of the T wave ascending limb</em>).</li><li>We emphasize that <em>“nonspecific ST segment straightening”</em> — is a <strong><em>descriptive</em> finding</strong>. It is <em>nonspecific</em>. It may mean nothing — especially if only seen in a single lead. In any case — it is <em>not</em> an acute change.

Note that the R wave in lead I is now <em>positive</em> — and global <em>negativity</em> has been restored to lead aVR — but that R wave progression is <em>unchanged</em>. This confirms <strong>limb lead <em>reversal</em></strong> as the cause of the <em>unusual</em> ECG findings that were seen in Figure 09.32-2 (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> — Technical errors will <em>definitely</em> be seen from time to time. Dextrocardia is rare — but important to recognize when it does occur. <em><strong>Full Review</strong></em> of this subject is covered in <strong>Section 03</strong>. Suffice it to say here — that attention to <strong>lead aVR</strong> is an easy way to facilitate recognizing <em>many</em> of the common technical mishaps (<strong>Figure 09.32-4</strong>).</p><p><strong>Figure 09.32-4:</strong> Limb lead appearance in <strong>Panel A</strong> should <em>immediately</em> suggest something is amiss. This is because: <strong>i)</strong> there is global <em>negativity</em> in <strong>lead I</strong>, which is virtually <em>never</em> seen under normal circumstances; <strong>ii) Lead aVR</strong> shows <strong><em>global</em> positivity</strong> (<em>which is also virtually never seen normally</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> the P wave is <em>not</em> upright in <strong>lead II</strong> (<em>which means either a non-sinus rhythm; dextrocardia, or lead reversal</em>). IF the precordial lead sequence for the limb leads in Panel A looked like <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>which shows normal R wave progression</em>) — We would suspect left and right arm limb lead reversal. But IF the precordial lead sequence looked like <strong>Panel C</strong> — the <em>reverse</em> R wave progression in C would strongly suggest dextrocardia (<em>See Section 03.11 for more details</em>).</p><p><strong>09.33 – Lead aVR: <em>in Acute Pulmonary Embolus</em></strong></p><p>Interpret the ECG shown in Figure 09.33-1 — obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock and acute hypoxemia.</p><ul><li>What <em>clinical</em> condition is suggested by this history and the <em>combination</em> of ECG findings seen in <strong>Figure 09.33-1</strong>?</li><li>Does this clinical diagnosis account for the <strong>ST elevation</strong> seen in <strong>lead aVR</strong>?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.33-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock and acute hypoxemia (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 08.32-1).

The hallmark of the <strong>ECG diagnosis</strong> of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> is <strong><em>generalized</em> ST elevation</strong> that occurs in a clinical setting consistent with this diagnosis. <em>Reciprocal</em> ST depression and large Q waves are <em>absent</em>. ST elevation typically manifests an <em>upward</em> concavity (<em>“smiley”-shape</em>) in most leads — with possible exception of <em>right-sided</em> leads (<em>leads aVR, V1 and sometimes lead III</em>) that may show T wave inversion.</p><ul><li>In addition to <em>generalized</em> ST elevation — <strong>PR segment <em>depression</em></strong> in at least <em>several</em> leads (<em>below the TP baseline</em>) is another helpful clue in support of the ECG diagnosis of acute pericarditis. PR depression is well seen in Figure 09.34-1 (<em>red arrows</em>).</li><li>The value of using <strong>lead aVR</strong> when contemplating a diagnosis of acute pericarditis — is that this lead often manifests <strong>PR segment <em>elevation</em></strong> (<em>blue arrow in</em> Figure 09.34-1). As will be emphasized in Section 12 — PR segment depression is far from definitive for confirming acute pericarditis. Nevertheless, recognition of <strong>PR depression</strong> in <em>several</em> leads in association with <strong>PR <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> — <em>together</em> with:** i)** generalized <em>concave-up</em> ST elevation in the <em>absence</em> of reciprocal ST depression; and <strong>ii)</strong> a clinical setting <em>consistent</em> with acute pericarditis — go a long way toward increasing our comfort level in the likelihood of this diagnosis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.34-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a 35-year old man with <em>atypical</em> chest pain. The ECG diagnosis of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> is suggested by: <strong>i)</strong> <em>generalized</em> concave-up ST elevation; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>absence</em> of reciprocal ST depression; <strong>iii)</strong> <em>absence</em> of large Q waves; <strong>iv)</strong> PR depression in a number of leads (<em>red arrows</em>); and <strong>v) PR <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>blue arrow</em>). Acute pericarditis is discussed in detail in Section 12.</p><p><strong>09.35 – Lead aVR: <em>in Atrial Infarction</em></strong></p><p>Atrial infarction is rare. ECG findings are subtle and often overlooked. As a result — most cases of atrial infarction are only diagnosed post-mortem on autopsy study. <em>Realistically</em> Speaking — being able to diagnose acute atrial infarction is unlikely to alter management. As a result — one is probably <em>none the worse</em> IF you <em>ignore</em> routinely looking for signs of atrial infarction (<em>as many clinicians seem to do</em>). That said — <em><strong>recognition</strong></em> of <strong>acute <em>atrial</em> infarction</strong> may explain <em>abrupt</em> onset of <em>supraventricular</em> arrhythmias that are prone to occur in association with <em>acute</em> MI. We therefore include this subject as an <em>advanced</em> topic. <em><strong>Consider</strong></em> the possibility of <strong>acute <em>atrial</em> infarction</strong> in the following clinical setting(s) — and in the presence of the following <strong>ECG signs</strong>:</p><ul><li>There is an <strong>ongoing <em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> (<em>ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</em>) that appears to be large (<em>as suggested by significant ST elevation and marked reciprocal ST depression</em>).</li><li>Proximal occlusion of a major coronary artery is suggested by the ECG or acute catheterization picture (<em>the SA nodal artery is supplied by the Right Coronary Artery in ~60% of cases — with the circumflex accounting for most of the rest, though anatomic variations are possible</em>). By far, <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> MI</strong> — is the most common location for <em>acute</em> MI associated with atrial infarction. Whether this is the result of more likely origin for the SA nodal artery from the RCA — or due to the much higher oxygen content of left atrial blood is uncertain. There is often <em>associated</em> ECG evidence of <strong>acute <em>posterior</em></strong> and **RV **(<em>Right Ventricular</em>) <strong>involvement</strong> — supporting the likelihood of <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion (<strong>Figure 09.35-1</strong>).</li><li>There is <strong><em>abrupt</em> onset</strong> of <strong>AFib</strong> or <em>other</em> atrial tachyarrhythmia in association with <em>acute</em> STEMI. Less commonly there may be PR interval prolongation, sinus pauses or sinus arrest. Abrupt loss of the atrial kick in a patient with a large acute MI may result in sudden cardiac decompensation (<em>from acute heart failure</em>).</li><li>In addition to <em>acute</em> STEMI (<em>usually from inferior MI</em>) — there are <strong><em>acute</em> PTa deviations</strong> (<em>elevation or depression of the T wave component of the preceding P wave, during which time atrial repolarization takes place = “PTa” wave</em>). These PTa segment deviations may vary in lead location, depending on <em>which</em> atrium and <em>what part</em> of the atria is infarcting (<em>left or right atrium; atrial free wall or appendage</em>). The ECG picture in <em>schematic</em> <strong>Figure 09.35-1</strong> — is typical for the changes one might expect with acute right atrial infarction.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.35-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG illustrating expected findings from acute right atrial infarction. Note: <strong>i)</strong> underlying acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI; <strong>ii)</strong> PTa segment depression in the <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>red arrows</em>) — and perhaps also in V2; and <strong>iii) PTa elevation</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> and lead V1 (<em>green arrows</em>). <em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Proximal RCA occlusion is suggested in this schematic tracing by the finding of <em>more</em> ST elevation in lead III than lead II and by <em>marked</em> ST depression in lead aVL. Acute RV involvement is suggested by the relatively flat ST segment in lead V1 in the face of <em>marked</em> ST depression in V2. <em>Right-sided</em> leads could confirm acute RV involvement.</p><p>Now look at the ECG in <strong>Figure 09.35-2</strong> — obtained from a patient with chest pain. There is obvious acute <em>inferior</em> STEMI — which is most probably from acute RCA occlusion (<em>marked ST elevation in lead III > II; marked ST depression in lead aVL</em>). ST depression in leads V1 and V2 suggest associated <em>posterior</em> involvement.</p><ul><li>Do you <em>also</em> see ECG signs suggestive of <strong>acute <em>atrial</em> infarction</strong> in Figure 09.35-2? <em>Wouldn’t it be easy to overlook this?</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.35-2:</strong> Acute <em>infero-postero</em> STEMI. In addition — there is ECG evidence of <strong>acute <em>atrial</em> infarction</strong>. This is suggested by PTa depression in leads II,III,aVF and V5,V6 (<em>red arrows</em>) — <em>plus</em> <strong>PTa elevation</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>blue arrow</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Atrial infarction is rare. Even when present, this diagnosis is rarely made by ECG while the patient is still alive — as ECG signs are often extremely subtle (Figure 09.35-2). Nevertheless — attention to the clinical setting and recognition of PTa segment deviations (<em>PR segment elevation or depression</em>) may suggest the diagnosis and explain certain potential complications of acute myocardial infarction. This is an <em>advanced</em> topic that clearly extends <em>“beyond-the-core”</em>.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Note that <em>both</em> acute pericarditis (Figure 09.34-1) — <em>and</em> atrial infarction (Figure 09.35-2) — are examples of relatively uncommon <em>clinical</em> conditions that may result in <strong>PR depression</strong> in several leads <em>with</em> <strong>PR <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong>. Clinical circumstances and the <em>overall</em> ECG picture allow easy distinction between these 2 conditions.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Shakir DK, Arafa SOE: <em>Right Atrial Infarction, Atrial Arrhythmia and Inferior MI from a Missed Triad: Case Report & Review of the Literature</em>. Can J Cardiol 23:995-997, 2007.</p><p><strong>09.36 – Lead aVR: <em>in Supraventricular Arrhythmias</em></strong></p><p>Among the most helpful uses of lead aVR is in the interpretation of cardiac arrhythmias. <strong>Lead aVR</strong> may be <em><strong>beneficial</strong></em> in <strong>2 <em>principal</em> ways</strong>: <strong>i)</strong> in detecting subtle <em>atrial</em> activity in certain <em>supraventricular</em> tachyarrhythmias (<em>Section 09.36</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> in making a definitive diagnosis of VT (<em>Section 09.37</em>).</p><ul><li>In general — the <em>best</em> lead to look at for assessment of atrial activity is <strong>lead II</strong>. This is because IF the <strong>P wave</strong> is <em><strong>upright</strong></em> and conducting in lead II (ie, <em>the PR interval is constant</em>) — then there is <strong><em>sinus</em> rhythm</strong>. In addition — P wave amplitude is often greatest in lead II, which makes P waves easy to see under normal circumstances.</li><li>The <em>next-best</em> lead to look at for assessment of atrial activity is <strong>lead V1</strong>. This is because this <em>right-sided</em> lead conveniently provides an <em>anatomically</em> close electrical perspective of normal atrial activity as the atria are depolarized.</li><li>Clinically — atrial activity is <em>not</em> always clearly evident in leads II and V1. This is especially true for certain <em>regular</em> SVT (<em>SupraVentricular Tachycardia</em>) rhythms — in which the rapid rate results in a <em>shortening</em> of the R-R interval. This may provide a “cover” (<em>the preceding T wave</em>) — within which atrial activity may be hiding. The unique electrical vantage point of <strong>lead aVR</strong> may occasionally help to overcome this problem by providing a clue to underlying atrial activity that may <em>not</em> be as readily evident in <em>other</em> leads (<strong>Figure 09.36-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.36-1:</strong> 12-lead ECG demonstrating a <strong><em>regular</em> SVT rhythm</strong> at ~150/minute <em>without</em> normal atrial activity (ie, <em>no upright P wave in lead II</em>). <strong>Question:</strong> Is there evidence of <strong><em>atrial</em> activity</strong> in <strong><em>other</em> leads?</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.36-1:</strong> The rhythm is a <strong><em>regular</em> SVT</strong> at <strong>~150/minute</strong> — but <em>without</em> normal atrial activity (<em>since lead II does not show an upright P wave</em>). The principal <strong><em>differential</em> diagnosis</strong> consists of 3 entities:** i)** Sinus tachycardia; <strong>ii)</strong> PSVT; and <strong>iii)</strong> Atrial flutter. As discussed in Section 02.19 — looking at <strong><em>additional</em> leads</strong> in the hope of identifying <strong><em>atrial</em> activity</strong> may be insightful.</p><ul><li><strong>PEARL:</strong> Use of <em><strong>calipers</strong></em> facilitates the process. Setting one’s calipers at <em>precisely</em> half the R-R interval — allows you to walk out atrial activity in several leads (<strong>Figure 09.36-2</strong>). This <em><strong>confirms</strong></em> the diagnosis of <strong>AFlutter</strong> with 2:1 AV conduction (<em>atrial rate = 300/minute; ventricular rate = 150/minute</em>).</li><li>Note how helpful looking at <strong>lead aVR</strong> is in Figure 09.36-2 — for increasing our level of comfort that 2:1 AV conduction is <em>truly</em> present. Clear demonstration of 2:1 AV conduction in multiple leads (<em>red and blue arrows</em>) may obviate diagnostic need for performing a vagal maneuver.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.36-2:</strong> Arrows have been added to Figure 09.36-1 to facilitate recognition of atrial activity. Note that 2 <em>evenly-spaced</em> negative deflections are present for each QRS complex in lead II (<em>red arrows</em>). Regular flutter waves are also well seen in <strong>lead aVR</strong>, as well as in selected other leads (<em>blue arrows</em>).</p><p><strong>Retrograde Atrial Activity:</strong> Another way in which <em>additional</em> leads may facilitate diagnosis of <em>regular</em> SVT rhythms — is in identifying <strong><em>retrograde</em> atrial activity</strong>. Our 2 <em>“favorite”</em> leads to look for <em>retrograde</em> P waves in — are <strong>lead aVR</strong> and <strong>lead V1</strong> (Figure 09.36-3).</p><ul><li>As emphasized in Section 02.29 and Section 02.30 — <strong>PSVT</strong> is a <strong><em>reentry</em> tachycardia</strong> that usually involves at least <em>some</em> portion of the AV node. Confirmation that <em><strong>reentry</strong></em> is the mechanism of a <em>regular</em> SVT rhythm when normal P waves are absent — is forthcoming from identifying <em>retrograde</em> atrial activity <em>during</em> the tachycardia.</li><li><strong><em>Retrograde</em> P waves</strong> during PSVT are often subtle, if evident at all. They may be nothing more than a <em>tiny</em> notch seen in the <em>terminal</em> portion of the QRS in one or more of the <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>red arrows in</em> <strong>Figure 09.36-3</strong>).</li><li>Support that such notching is <em>real</em> and a reflection of <em>retrograde</em> atrial activity — is forthcoming from identifying retrograde P waves in <em>other</em> leads. While <strong><em>retrograde</em> P waves</strong> are <em>negative</em> when seen in lead II or other inferior leads — they are generally <em><strong>positive</strong></em> when seen in <strong>lead V1</strong> <em>and/or</em> <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>blue arrows in</em> Figure 09.36-3).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.36-3:</strong> <em>Regular</em> SVT rhythm <em>without</em> normal P waves at a rate of ~180/minute (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 02.30-1). Retrograde atrial activity is suggested by subtle <em>negative</em> notching in the terminal part of the QRS in each of the inferior leads (<em>red arrows — which are best seen in the lead II blow-up in the center of the tracing</em>). Support that such notching is <em>real</em> and reflects <em>retrograde</em> P waves from a <em>reentry</em> mechanism — is forthcoming from the “pseudo-r-prime” (<em>positive terminal notching</em>) that is seen in the QRS complex in <em>both</em> leads aVR and V1 (<em>blue arrows</em>). This <strong><em>confirms</em> reentry</strong> and the diagnosis of <strong>PSVT</strong> as the mechanism of the arrhythmia (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>09.37 – Lead aVR: <em>for Definitive Diagnosis of VT</em></strong></p><p>In Sections 02.47 <em>through</em> 02.51 — We emphasized the importance of <em>always</em> assuming a <strong><em>regular</em> WCT</strong> (<em>Wide-Complex Tachycardia</em>) <strong>rhythm</strong> was <strong>VT</strong> (<em>Ventricular Tachycardia</em>) until <em>proven</em> otherwise. This is because:** i)** VT is by far (<em>>80-90% of the time</em>) the most common cause of a <em>regular</em> WCT rhythm when sinus P waves are <em>not</em> evident; and <strong>ii)</strong> VT is the most serious cause of a <em>regular</em> WCT. That said — *Wouldn’t it be nice *to be able to <em>increase</em> our diagnostic <em>certainty</em> that a <em>regular</em> WCT was VT <em>beyond</em> this 80-90% likelihood probability?</p><ul><li>Consider the <strong><em>regular</em> WCT rhythm</strong> shown in <strong>Figure 09.37-1</strong> — obtained from an adult with a history of heart disease. <em>How certain</em> are you that the rhythm is VT?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.37-1:</strong> <em>Regular</em> WCT rhythm obtained from a patient with heart disease. <em>How certain</em> are you that the rhythm is VT? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.37-1:</strong> The rhythm is a <strong><em>regular</em> WCT</strong> at <strong>~180/minute</strong>. There is no sign of atrial activity. <strong>VT</strong> should be assumed <em>until</em> proven otherwise (<strong>LIST #1</strong> — <em>from</em> Figure 02.47-1).</p><ul><li>In <strong>Section 02.50</strong> — We emphasized how use of <strong>3 <em>Simple</em> Rules</strong> can increase diagnostic likelihood <em>beyond</em> the 90% probability level predicted by the presence of any <em>regular</em> WCT rhythm in an adult with heart disease. Applying these <strong>3 <em>Simple</em> Rules</strong> from Section 02.50 to the rhythm in Figure 09.37-1 — Note that there is: <strong>i)</strong> <em>extreme</em> axis deviation (<em>entirely negative QRS in lead aVF</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> amorphous = “ugly” and <em>very</em> wide QRS morphology (<em>the QRS is well over 0.16 second in duration</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> an almost <em>entirely</em> negative QRS complex in lead V6. We estimate that these ECG findings during tachycardia increase VT likelihood to ~98%.</li><li>The <em>additional</em> finding of an <strong><em>entirely</em> upright</strong> (<em>monophasic</em>) <strong>QRS complex</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> during this WCT rhythm increases <strong><em>diagnostic</em> certainty</strong> of <strong>VT</strong> to <strong><em>virtually</em> 100%</strong>! This is because the <em>only</em> way a monophasic (<em>entirely positive</em>) QRS complex can be seen in lead aVR during WCT — is IF the electrical impulse originates from a site in the ventricular apex. <em>Nothing else other than VT does this</em> (<strong>Figure 09.37-2</strong>).</li><li>In contrast — we learn <em>nothing</em> about the etiology of a WCT rhythm IF lead aVR is either initially negative — or manifests anything but a large monophasic R wave (*2nd and 3rd examples in *Figure 09.37-2).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.37-2:</strong> The finding of a <strong>large <em>monophasic</em> R wave</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> during a WCT rhythm is <em><strong>diagnostic</strong></em> of <strong>VT</strong> with virtual 100% accuracy. In contrast — <em>anything but</em> a large <em>monophasic</em> R wave (<em>2nd and 3rd examples in this figure</em>) is of <em>no</em> diagnostic utility in differentiation (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> The criterion of a <strong>monophasic <em>upright</em> R wave</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> is admittedly insensitive. As a result — this finding will only be seen in a minority of WCT rhythms. Nevertheless, we mention it as a <strong><em>special</em> use</strong> of <strong>lead aVR</strong> in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias — because in those few cases when a monophasic R wave is seen in lead aVR (<strong>Figure 09.37-3</strong>) — the diagnosis of VT is <em>virtually</em> assured.</p><ul><li>As should be obvious — diagnosis of VT is <em>overwhelmingly</em> likely in Figure 09.37-3, even <em>without</em> use of lead aVR. That said — once lead aVR appearance is noted, there is <em>no longer</em> the <em>slightest</em> doubt that the rhythm is VT (<em>which allows us to focus full effort on treatment</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Sasaki K: <em>A New Simple Algorithm for Diagnosing Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia: Comparison with Brugada, Vereckei and aVR Algorithms</em>.

Although far less commonly encountered than in the past — <em>severe</em> TCA poisoning is still occasionally seen. It is well to remember that overdose of <em>other</em> medications (ie, <em>quinidine; procainamide; flecainide</em>) may produce a similar ECG picture of sodium-channel blockade. The principal <strong><em>adverse</em> effects</strong> of <strong><em>severe</em> TCA overdose</strong> include: <strong>i)</strong> Neurotoxicity (<em>seizures; delirium</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> Cardiovascular toxicity (<em>life-threatening ventricular tachydysrhythmias; myocardial depression; hypotension; preterminal bradycardia</em>). The <strong>ECG picture</strong> may be unique (Figure 09.38-1) — and is recognized by the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Sinus Tachycardia</strong> — is almost always seen with severe TCA ingestion until very late in the course (<em>ultimately there may be preterminal bradycardia</em>).</li><li><strong>QRS prolongation</strong> — to at least 0.10 second. Rather than the QT — it is QRS prolongation that best predicts severity of the overdose. Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are more likely once QRS duration exceeds 0.16 second. Of interest — QRS prolongation especially affects the <em>terminal</em> portion of the QRS, such that the initial part of the QRS is often not overly abnormal.</li><li><strong>RAD</strong> (<em>Right Axis Deviation</em>) — which manifests as: <strong>i)</strong> a wide terminal S wave in lead I; and <strong>ii)</strong> a <strong><em>prominent</em> R’</strong> (<em>>3mm tall</em>) in <strong>lead aVR</strong>, that is often taller than the S wave is deep in this lead.</li><li><em>Predisposition</em> to <strong><em>potentially</em> lethal VT</strong> (<em>Ventricular Tachycardia</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Other</em> ECG findings</strong> that may be seen in severe TCA overdose include: <strong>i)</strong> QT prolongation; <strong>ii)</strong> PR interval prolongation; <strong>iii)</strong> RBBB; <strong>iv)</strong> a transient Brugada pattern in anterior precordial leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Given that <strong>ECG signs</strong> of <strong><em>severe</em> TCA toxicity</strong> include: <strong>i)</strong> <em>marked</em> QRS widening and <strong>ii)</strong> PR as well as QT prolongation — it may at times be difficult (<em>if not impossible</em>) to distinguish between: <strong>i)</strong> sinus tachycardia with a wide QRS and 1st-degree AV block (<em>with P waves hidden within tall T waves made prominent by QT prolongation</em>); vs <strong>ii)</strong> VT.</p><ul><li>Fortunately — clinical distinction between these 2 forms of <em>wide-complex</em> tachycardia (<em>VT vs sinus tach</em>) is <em>not</em> essential for appropriate <em>initial</em> management because: <strong>i) <em>Sodium</em> Bicarbonate</strong> is recommended as the drug of choice <em>regardless</em> of whether the wide rhythm is sinus tachycardia or VT; and <strong>ii)</strong> antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol or flecainide are all contraindicated for treatment of VT with TCA overdose (<em>because these agents may all aggravate myocardial depression, hypotension, and conduction defects</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Clinical context (ie, <em>that the patient overdosed on a TCA</em>) — <em>prior</em> ECGs on the patient — and <em>serial</em> tracings may sometimes be needed in order to become comfortable distinguishing between sinus tachycardia with severe TCA poisoning vs VT (<strong>Figure 09.38-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.38-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a young adult who presented to the ED after TCA overdose.

NOTE: Use of lead aVR in this manner is an <em>advanced</em> topic.</p><ul><li>The remote <em>superior</em> and <em>right-sided</em> electrical viewpoint of <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>looking down at the heart from the right shoulder</em>) — provides a unique vantage point that assesses the <strong><em>basal</em> part</strong> of the <strong><em>interventricular</em> septum</strong>. Ischemia of the septum (<em>as may occur with severe left main disease</em>) produces a vector that points superiorly — resulting in <strong>ST <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong>. There will often be associated ST elevation in lead aVL and ST depression in the inferior leads).</li><li><em>Similar</em> ECG findings may often be seen with <strong>acute <em>proximal</em> LAD</strong> (<em>Left Anterior Descending</em>)** occlusion**, in which there is involvement of the 1st septal artery branch.</li><li>In contrast to <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion — <strong>more <em>distal</em> LAD occlusion</strong> generally does <em>not</em> involve the same area of the septum. As a result — ST elevation in lead aVR is <em>not</em> seen. Instead — ST elevation is most marked in <em>anterior</em> leads (<em>V2,V3,V4</em>).</li><li>Assessment of the <em>clinical</em> significance of ST elevation in lead aVR is complicated by the fact that this lead provides reciprocal (<em>mirror-image</em>) information to one or more lateral leads. Specifically — ST depression in leads II, aVL, V5,V6 may result in some ST elevation in aVR <em>independent</em> of septal involvement.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>PEARL:</strong> Distinction between <em>left-main</em> disease vs <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion may be suggested on ECG by the <strong><em>relative</em> amount</strong> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> seen in <strong>lead aVR</strong> <em>compared to</em> <strong>lead V1</strong>.</p><ul><li>Think <em><strong>Left-Main</strong></em> disease — when ST elevation in lead aVR > V1.</li><li>Think <strong><em>proximal</em> LAD</strong> disease/occlusion — when ST elevation in lead V1 > aVR.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Distinction should be made between <strong><em>acute</em> LMCA</strong> (<em>Left Main Coronary Artery</em>)** occlusion** vs LMCA** disease.**</p><ul><li>Most patients with <em>acute</em> LMCA occlusion do <em>not</em> survive. As a result — this entity is <em>not</em> often seen and <em>unlikely</em> to be appreciated clinically. Rapid deterioration with patient demise due to cardiogenic shock is the usual result <em>unless</em> acute LMCA occlusion can be <em>immediately</em> recognized and <em>immediately</em> acted on.</li><li>In those <em>rare</em> circumstances when <em>acute</em> LMCA occlusion is captured on ECG — rather than diffuse ST depression there should be diffuse precordial ST <em>elevation</em> in association with ST elevation in lead aVR.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Consider the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 09.40-1</strong> — obtained from an older adult with a history of chest discomfort over time.</p><ul><li>What is the principal abnormality on this ECG?

In addition, there is ST elevation in leads aVR and V1 (<em>red arrows</em>). This pattern suggests <strong><em>severe</em> CAD</strong> (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.40-1:</strong> An important pattern to recognize on ECG — is the finding of <strong><em>diffuse</em> ST depression</strong> (<em>usually in ≥7-8 leads</em>) in association with <strong>ST <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong>. These findings are seen in Figure 9.40-1:</p><ul><li>Especially when seen in an <em>older</em> adult — there is a <em>high</em> correlation with this ECG pattern and <strong><em>severe</em> CAD</strong> (<em>usually 3-vessel — <em>or</em> proximal LAD/left main disease</em>).</li><li>It is difficult to distinguish between <em>severe</em> 3-vessel disease vs a <em>proximal</em> LAD or left main lesion on the basis of this ECG alone.</li><li><em>Additional</em> findings of potential concern in Figure 09.40-1 are: <strong>i)</strong> that there is also some ST elevation in lead V1 and <strong>ii)</strong> that <em>incomplete</em> RBBB is present (<em>rSr’ in V1; tiny-but-present S waves in leads I,V6</em>).</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> The ST elevation that is seen in lead V1 appears to be <em>minimal</em> and is <em>less</em> in amount than the ST elevation seen in lead aVR. As a result —the possibility of <em>left-main</em> disease should at least be considered. In contrast — <em>left-main</em> disease would be far <em>less</em> likely IF ST elevation in lead V1 was greater than in lead aVR.</li><li><em><strong>BOTTOM <em>Line</em></strong></em>:** <em>Be aware</em> of the <strong>ECG pattern</strong> shown in Figure 09.40-1 — in which ST flattening with at least <em>some</em> depression is seen in <em>multiple</em> leads <em>in association with</em> ST elevation in lead aVR. Especially when seen in an older adult with symptoms consistent with angina — <em>severe</em> CAD is likely.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Now consider the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 09.40-2</strong> — obtained from an acutely ill patient with severe <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. Having just emphasized how clinically <em>rare</em> it is to encounter a patient with <strong><em>acute</em> LMCA occlusion</strong> — We feel this may be one exception. We note the following findings:</p><ul><li>There is sinus tachycardia and QRS widening due to <strong>acute <em>bifascicular</em> block</strong> (<em>RBBB/LAHB</em>). Although admittedly difficult to see the low amplitude upright P wave in lead II — it looks like there may <em>also</em> be 1st degree AV block.</li><li>There is <em>marked</em> <strong>diffuse ST elevation</strong> (*in leads I,<strong><strong>aVL</strong></strong>; V1-through-V6; <em>and</em> in *<em><strong>lead aVR</strong></em>). There is marked <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> in inferior leads.</li><li>Small <strong>q waves</strong> have already formed in leads aVL; V1,V2,V3.</li><li>ST elevation is fairly marked (<em>at least 2-3mm</em>) in <em>both</em> lead aVR and in lead V1 (<em>red arrows</em>). While we <em>cannot</em> be sure if ST elevation is more in aVR or in V1 — this patient’s acute presentation in conjunction with new <em>bifascicular</em> block (<em>plus possible 1st degree AV block</em>) and the <em>dramatic</em> ST-T wave changes seen here (*with <strong><strong>marked ST elevation</strong></strong> in *<strong>lead aVR</strong>) support <em>high</em> likelihood of acute <em>proximal</em> occlusion (<em>of either the LMCA or proximal LAD</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.40-2:</strong> ECG from an acutely ill patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. New <em>bifascicular</em> block in context with <em>dramatic</em> ST-T wave changes seen here (<em>including</em> <strong>ST elevation</strong> <em>in</em> <strong>lead aVR</strong> <em>and in lead V1 — red arrows</em>) — suggest acute <em>proximal</em> occlusion of <em>either</em> the LAD or LCMA (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>We conclude Section 09.40 with the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 09.40-3</strong> — obtained from a woman with chest pain and heart failure. We previously encountered this ECG in Section 09.28 — at which time we focused attention on the <em>diffuse</em> ST segment depression that is seen (<em>red arrows</em>).</p><ul><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> In addition to <em>diffuse</em> ST depression — there is also <em>significant</em> ST elevation in <strong>lead aVR</strong> of Figure 09.40-3. *Is this patient likely to have severe CAD *because there is diffuse ST depression <em>with</em> ST elevation in lead aVR?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 09.40-3:</strong> ECG obtained from a woman with chest pain and heart failure (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 09.28-1). Note <em>diffuse</em> ST depression <em>with</em> ST elevation in lead aVR. Is this patient likely to have <em>severe</em> CAD? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 09.40-3:</strong> As discussed in Section 09.28 — the rhythm is PSVT at a rate of ~180/minute. Although <em>diffuse</em> ST depression is present in association <em>with</em> ST elevation in lead aVR — this does <em>not</em> necessarily indicate significant coronary artery disease because there is <em>marked</em> tachycardia. Instead — each of the entities in <strong>LIST #4</strong> (<em>Section 09.26</em>) should be considered as possibly contributing to the ST depression that is seen. The list of common causes of ST depression includes: <strong>i)</strong> Ischemia; <strong>ii)</strong> “Strain”; <strong>iii)</strong> Digitalis effect; <strong>iv)</strong> Low serum K+/Mg++; <strong>v)</strong> Rate-related changes (<em>from tachycardia</em>); and/or <strong>vi) <em>Any</em> combination</strong> of causes i) <em>through</em> v).</p><ul><li>We advise <em>against</em> even contemplating the possibility of severe CAD <em>until</em> after resolution of the tachycardia. Then <em>repeat</em> the ECG.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.0 – Acute MI / Ischemia</strong></p><p><strong>10.1 – The Patient with Chest Pain: <em>WHY Do an ECG?</em></strong></p><p>One of the <em>KEY</em> reasons for obtaining an ECG is to help <em><strong>evaluate</strong></em> the patient with <strong><em>new-onset</em> CP</strong> (<em>Chest Pain</em>). By doing so we hope to determine: <strong>i)</strong> IF there are <em>any</em> <strong><em>acute</em> ECG changes?</strong> and <strong>ii)</strong> Is there evidence of <strong><em>prior</em> MI</strong> (<em>Myocardial Infarction</em>)<strong>?</strong> Specifically — We <em>want</em> to know:</p><ul><li>Is there <em>ongoing</em> <strong>ACS</strong> (<em><strong>A</strong></em><em>cute <strong><strong>C</strong></strong>oronary <strong><strong>S</strong></strong>yndrome</em>)<strong>?</strong> This is determined by <em><strong>history</strong></em> — <em><strong>troponins</strong></em> — and by assessment of <strong>acute</strong> and <strong><em>serial</em> ECG changes</strong>.</li><li>If there is ACS — <em>What</em> area(s) of the heart are involved? — How <em>extensive</em> is the area of involvement?</li><li>What is the cardiac rhythm? (<em>Any arrhythmias?</em>).</li><li>Are there conduction defects? (<em>BBB? AV block?</em>).</li><li><em>KEY:</em> Is patient a <em><strong>candidate</strong></em> for <strong><em>acute</em> intervention?</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.2 – <em>What is a “Silent” MI?</em></strong></p><p>As many as <strong>1/3</strong> of <em>all</em> infarcts are <strong><em>&ldquo;silent&rdquo;</em> MIs</strong> — which means that these infarcts are <em>not</em> associated with chest pain. Approximately <em>half</em> of this group (ie, <em>~1/6 of all MI patients</em>) — have <em>“other”</em> symptoms (<em>but not chest pain</em>). These <strong><em>non-chest-pain-equivalent</em> symptoms</strong> may include: <strong>i)</strong> acute dyspnea (<em>shortness of breath</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> GI symptoms; <strong>iii)</strong> vague myalgias or <em>flu-like</em> syndrome; or <strong>iv)</strong> mental status change (<em>especially confusion</em>). The <em>other half</em> of this group (~<em>1/6 of all MI patients</em>) — have <strong><em>no</em> symptoms</strong> at all.</p><ul><li>Although <strong><em>“silent”</em> MI</strong> is more common in the elderly — this entity may occur in <em>any</em> age group (<em>regardless of whether or not the patient has diabetes or other medical issue that might impair sensation</em>).</li><li>By far — the most common of the <em>non-chest-pain equivalent</em> symptoms is shortness of breath! For this reason — We advise obtaining an <strong>ECG</strong> on virtually <em>any</em> adult of a certain age who presents with <strong>unexplained <em>new-onset</em> dyspnea</strong>. A “silent” MI may have precipitated pulmonary symptoms/heart failure.</li><li>Awareness of the surprising <em>prevalence</em> of “silent” MI in the general population — should prompt you to inquire about a <strong><em>possible</em> “event”</strong> (ie, <em>infarction</em>) whenever the patient presents with <em>unexplained</em> symptoms that might be attributable to an <em>undetected</em> recent infarction. Examples include: <strong>i)</strong> Recent <em>new</em> edema/heart failure but <em>without</em> a history of chest pain; and <strong>ii)</strong> <em>New</em> fatigue <em>and/or</em> confusion in an <em>older</em> patient <em>without</em> plausible explanation. Have a <strong><em>low</em> threshold</strong> to obtain an <strong>ECG</strong> on such patients — even though they are <em>not</em> having chest pain.</li><li><strong>Comparison</strong> with a <strong><em>prior</em> ECG</strong> may be <em><strong>invaluable</strong></em> for determining IF abnormalities seen on a current ECG are new or old. IF <em>old</em> records are <em>not</em> readily available — Use fax or cell phone transmission to <em>expedite</em> the process.</li><li>**<em>Bottom <em>Line:</em></em> The entity of <strong><em>“silent”</em> MI</strong> is much more <em><strong>common</strong></em> than is generally appreciated. Not all <em>“silent”</em> MIs are truly “silent”. Instead — <strong><em>other</em> symptoms</strong> (<em>especially shortness of breath — but also confusion, malaise, etc.</em>) are commonly associated with this entity. Maintaining a <strong><em>high</em> index</strong> of <strong>suspicion</strong> is essential in order not to overlook <em>previous</em> MIs that may have been subtle and without the usual symptom of <em>cardiac-sounding</em> chest pain. Comparison of the patient’s <em>current</em> ECG with a <strong><em>prior</em> ECG</strong> may be invaluable and indicate that a patient you thought had no prior history of heart disease has actually <em>had</em> an MI at some time in the past.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.3 – The ECG in <em>Acute</em> MI: <em>What are the Changes?</em></strong></p><p>Recent years have seen *increased *emphasis on use of the ECG for evaluation of ACS. We look for <strong><em>acute</em> ECG changes</strong> (Figure 10.3-1). The goal is to determine ASAP from <em>wherever</em> the patient is first seen — as to whether **<em>acute <em>intervention</em></em> is likely to be beneficial:</p><ul><li>The <em>KEY</em> is to recognize <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> (<em><strong>ST E</strong></em><em>levation <strong><strong>M</strong></strong>yocardial</em>*** I***<em>nfarction</em>) at the earliest opportunity — because this is the group of patients most likely to benefit from <strong><em>acute</em> reperfusion</strong> (<em>angioplasty/stenting</em>) of the occluded vessel.</li><li><em><strong>Once acute STEMI <em>is</em> identified</strong></em> — the process of <em>notifying</em> cardiology and/or <em>activating</em> the cath lab is set into motion. This will <em>ideally</em> be accomplished within <em>minutes</em> of obtaining and interpreting the patient’s <em>initial</em> ECG.</li><li>Most patients with <strong>NSTEMI</strong> (<em><strong>N</strong></em><em>on</em>***-ST E****levation *<em><strong>MI</strong></em>) — do <em>not</em> need acute intervention. The reason for <em>expediting</em> assessment of the <em>initial</em> ECG is to find those who do.</li><li>Realize that what <em>begins</em> as a <em>non</em>-ST-elevation picture — might <em>evolve</em> into an <em>acute</em> STEMI. This is the reason for having a <em>low</em> threshold for <strong><em>repeating</em> the ECG</strong> (<em>sometimes more than once</em>) when evaluating a patient with new-onset <em>ongoing</em> chest pain. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Acute ECG changes may evolve <em>in as little as</em> 20-30 minutes.</li><li><strong>ECG Indicators</strong> of <strong><em>Acute</em> MI</strong> — are shown in <strong>Figure 10.3-1</strong>:</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.3-1:</strong> ECG Indicators of <em>Acute</em> MI: <strong>1</strong>) ST segment elevation; <strong>2</strong>) T wave inversion; <strong>3</strong>) Q wave development; and <strong>4</strong>) <em>Reciprocal</em> ST depression in <em>other</em> lead areas.</p><p><strong>10.4 – ECG Indicators: 1) <em>ST Segment Elevation</em></strong></p><p>The hallmark of acute coronary artery occlusion *— *is <strong>ST segment <em>elevation</em></strong>. This ST elevation is typically seen in the leads that <em>overly</em> the area of acute infarction (<strong>Panel 1</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 10.3-1). In general *— *the <em>greater</em> the amount of ST elevation and the <em>more</em> leads showing ST elevation *— *the <em>larger</em> the size of the acute MI (<em>and the more the potential for benefit from acute reperfusion</em>).</p><ul><li>CAVEAT #1: <em>Not</em> all ST elevation is the result of <em>acute</em> MI. <strong><em>Other</em> Reasons</strong> for <strong>ST elevation</strong> that may <em>not</em> be due to <em>acute</em> STEMI include: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Early</em> repolarization (<em>Section 09.19</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Ventricular</em> aneurysm (<em>suspected when ST elevation persists for months after a previous large infarction</em>); <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Acute</em> pericarditis (<em>Section 12.0</em>); and <strong>iv) <em>Other</em> conditions</strong> (<em>patients with LVH; LBBB; IVCD; cardiomyopathy may at times manifest long-term ST elevation in certain leads not due to acute stemi</em>).</li><li>CAVEAT #2: <strong>STEMI <em>“equivalent”</em> patterns</strong> exist.

These include: <strong>i)</strong> LVH or RVH <em>with</em> “strain” (<em>Section 08.9 and Section 08.28</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Acute</em> pulmonary embolus (<em>Section 08.37</em>); <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Juvenile</em> T wave variant (<em>Section 08.31</em>); <strong>iv) <em>Other</em> conditions</strong> (<em>medications; electrolyte disorders; BBB; cardiomyopathy; longstanding coronary artery disease; <em>and</em> various non-cardiac conditions may all manifest shallow or deep T wave inversion not due to an acute ischemic process</em>); plus <strong>v)</strong> A <strong><em>normal</em> variant pattern</strong> (<em>Isolated symmetric T inversion may sometimes be seen as a normal variant in leads III, aVF, aVL, aVR, <em>and/or</em> V1 —</em> Section 09.12).</li><li>CAVEAT #2: One can <em>not</em> tell IF even deep <em>symmetric</em> T inversion is <em>new</em> or <em>old</em> from looking at a <em>single</em> ECG. <strong>Comparison</strong> with a <strong><em>prior</em> tracing</strong> is needed.

A <em><strong>tincture</strong></em> of <strong>time</strong> *— *<strong><em>serial</em> ECGs</strong> *— *<strong>troponins</strong> and <strong><em>clinical</em> follow-up</strong> are all needed to determine IF <em>symmetric</em> T inversion present on <em>initial</em> ECG will <em>evolve</em> into a <em>Q-wave</em> or <em>non-Q-wave</em> infarction.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Consider the two 6-lead sequences shown in <strong>Figure 10.5-2</strong>.

T inversion in the <em>other</em> inferior leads (<em>leads II and aVF</em>) is <em>not</em> quite as deep — but it is present. We therefore interpret the picture in <strong>Panel A</strong> as highly suggestive of <strong><em>inferior</em> ischemia</strong>. In contrast — <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>which we have reproduced from</em> Figure 09.13-1) is much <strong><em>less</em> suggestive</strong> of <strong>ischemia</strong> because: <strong>i)</strong> T inversion is minimal (<em>if present at all</em>) in lead aVF and <em>absent</em> in lead II; plus <strong>ii)</strong> the QRS complex is predominantly <em>negative</em> in lead III. This could be normal — since the T wave vector often follows close behind the QRS vector (<em>Section 09.13</em>). Clinical correlation will be important to further assess these assumptions (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.5-2:</strong> The picture of ST segment <em>coving</em> and <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion in lead III is of potential concern for <em>both</em> Panel A and Panel B. That said — we are clearly <strong><em>more</em> concerned</strong> with <strong>Panel A</strong>.</p><ul><li>ST elevation or depression is always of more concern when <strong><em>similar</em> findings</strong> are found in <strong><em>neighboring</em> leads</strong>. Whereas T inversion/ST depression is seen in <em>each</em> of the <em>inferior</em> leads in <strong>Panel A</strong> (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) — T inversion is <em>isolated</em> to lead III in Panel B (<em>with no more than nonspecific ST flattening in lead aVF</em>).</li><li><strong>Lead III</strong> — is one of the leads that may <em>normally</em> manifest even <em>moderate-to-large</em> T wave inversion, without this being due to ischemia (<em>Section 09.12</em>). That this is the case in <strong>Panel B</strong> — is made more likely by the associated finding of a <strong>predominantly <em>negative</em> QRS</strong> complex in the lead showing T wave inversion.</li><li><strong>NOTE</strong>: We can <em>not</em> exclude the possibility of acute ischemia (<em>or even ongoing infarction</em>) from the limb lead sequence shown in Panel B. Clinical correlation and comparison with prior ECGs is needed to do so. But our suspicion of ischemia/infarction is clearly <em>less</em> for Panel B than it is for the limb lead sequence in Panel A.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.6 – ECG Indicators of <em>Acute</em> MI: 3) <em>Q Waves</em></strong></p><p>Development of <strong>Q waves</strong> has long been thought of as the <em><strong>marker</strong></em> that <strong><em>myocardial</em> infarction</strong> <em>has</em> taken place (<strong>Panel 3</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 10.6-1). In general, the <em>deeper</em> and <em>wider</em> a Q wave is and the <em>more</em> leads in a given lead area that manifest Q waves *— *the *more *likely it is that this ECG sign indicates ongoing or prior infarction. That said *— *there are important caveats to be aware of:</p><ul><li>CAVEAT #1: <em>Not</em> all patients with <em>acute</em> MI develop Q waves. Instead, there are **<em>non-Q-wave <em>infarctions</em></em> — in which <em>acute</em> MI is documented by history, <em>evolutionary</em> ECG changes and <em>positive</em> cardiac markers (<strong>troponins</strong>).</li><li>Among patients who <em>do</em> develop Q waves with infarction — transmural (<em>full-thickness</em>) involvement is <em>not</em> necessarily needed for a Q wave to form.</li><li>CAVEAT #2: When Q waves <em>do</em> develop — they do <em>not</em> necessarily last. Instead — Q waves may decrease in size with time. <em>They may even disappear</em>. As a result — the term, <em><strong>“significant Q wave”</strong></em> is <strong>problematic</strong>. Even a <em>small</em> Q wave may be <em>“significant”</em> in that it could be the <em>only</em> ECG sign remaining from a <em>prior</em> infarction.</li><li>CAVEAT #3: There are <strong><em>other</em> reasons</strong> for <strong>Q waves</strong> apart from serving as a marker of infarction. These include: <strong>i)</strong> Scarring, fibrosis, cardiomyopathy; <strong>ii)</strong> Lead placement errors (<em>Section 09.8</em>); <strong>iii) <em>Other</em> conditions</strong> (<em>patients with LVH; RVH/COPD; LBBB; LAHB; IVCD; chest wall deformity may all manifest poor R wave progression with resultant precordial Q waves — as listed in <em>Figure 09.7-1); plus</em></em> iv) <em>Normal</em> Variant** (<em>Be this in the form of normal small septal q waves <em>or</em> even moderate-to-large isolated Q waves in leads III, aVF, aVL, aVR, <em>and/or</em> V1</em>).

In the paragraphs below, we highlight development of Q waves (<strong>Panel 3</strong>).</p><p>**10.7 – Q Waves: *Why Do they Form? ***</p><p>The theory for genesis of Q waves is simple (<strong>Figure 10.7-1</strong>):</p><ul><li>After depolarization of the ventricular septum —** activation** of <strong><em>ventricular</em> myocardium</strong> begins. If one thinks of the LV (<em>Left Ventricle</em>) as a <em>cylindrical</em> structure — the <em>initial milliseconds</em> of the activation process are directed <em>outward</em> everywhere as the electrical impulse begins on its path from <em>inner</em> endocardium (<em><strong>Endo</strong></em>) — to the <em>outer</em> epicardial (<em><strong>Epi</strong></em>) layer of the heart (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 10.7-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.7-1:</strong> Genesis of Q waves. <em>Schematic</em> cross-sectional view of the heart. <em>Initial</em> electrical activity normally <em>cancels out</em> — as electrical activity is <em>opposing</em> everywhere (<strong>Panel A</strong>). The reason a <strong>Q wave</strong> forms over the area of infarction is that <em>null</em> electrical activity from myocardial necrosis is *no longer *opposed (<strong>Panel B</strong>). With <strong><em>posterior</em> infarction</strong> (<em>shown in</em> <strong>Panel C</strong>) — a <strong><em>tall</em> R wave</strong> is seen in <em>anterior</em> leads because of <em>loss</em> of posterior forces (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Looking <em>Closer</em> at Figure 10.7-1:</strong> An important concept to emphasize — is that the overwhelming majority of electrical forces involved in activation of the heart cancel each other out. The ECG waveforms we see on an electrocardiogram represent the <em>less</em> than 10% of electrical forces are <em>not</em> directly opposing each other. This concept is well illustrated in <strong>Panel A</strong> of <em>schematic</em> Figure 10.7-1 — in which <em>virtually all</em> electrical forces during the <em>initial</em> milliseconds of ventricular depolarization cancel each other out (<em>Note arrows in</em> Panel A <em>oppose each other in all directions — resulting in a null vector for the very first instant during ventricular activation</em>).</p><ul><li><strong>Panel B</strong> — schematically depicts what occurs during the initial milliseconds of ventricular activation in the presence of <strong><em>anterior</em> infarction</strong> (*black area in *Panel B). The reason a <strong>Q wave</strong> develops over <strong><em>anterior</em> leads</strong> — is that <em>outward-directed</em> posterior forces are now <em>unopposed</em> because of the null vector over the anterior area of infarction.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> — depicts what occurs with <strong><em>posterior</em> infarction</strong> (<em>to be discussed in detail in Sections 10.33-through-10.37</em>). In this case — the <em>null</em> electrical vector (<em>black area</em>) lies posteriorly over the area of infarction. The result is <em>unopposed</em> forces that move anteriorly. This generates a <strong><em>tall</em> R wave</strong> in <strong><em>anterior</em> leads</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.8 – ECG Terminology: <em>Distinction between Q, q and QS waves?</em></strong></p><p>You will often be asked to <em>verbally</em> describe the ECG findings noted on a given tracing. This becomes especially relevant when evaluating patients for acute or prior infarction. It is therefore important to clarify <em>semantics</em> of the <strong>ECG Terminology</strong> that is most commonly used for description (<strong>Figure 10.8-1</strong>):</p><ul><li>If a <em>negative</em> deflection <em>precedes</em> the QRS complex — it is termed a <strong>Q wave</strong>.</li><li>The first <em>upward</em> deflection of the QRS complex is termed an <strong>R wave</strong>. If this is followed by a <em>second</em> upward deflection (<em>as occurs in lead V1 with RBBB</em>) — it is called an <strong>R’</strong> (<em>R prime</em>).</li><li>The downward deflection that <em>follows</em> the R wave is termed an <strong>S wave</strong>. (NOTE: *An S wave is only said to be present *— <em>IF the negative deflection after the R wave descends below the baseline</em>).</li><li>**<em>KEY</em> Point: **Given the importance of <strong>Q waves</strong> as a <em><strong>“marker”</strong></em> of <strong>infarction</strong> — the <em>initial</em> direction of the QRS complex should be <em>closely</em> scrutinized to determine IF it is up (<em>an r wave</em>) or down (<em>a q wave</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.8-1:</strong> QRS Nomenclature. Although tiny — the <em>initial</em> QRS deflection in <strong>Panel A</strong> is upward. This deflection is therefore an <strong>r wave</strong>. In <strong>Panel B</strong> — the <em>initial</em> QRS deflection is <em>downward</em>. It is therefore a <strong>q wave</strong>. A <strong><em>lower</em> case</strong> designation is used since this q wave in Panel B is <em>less</em> than 3mm in depth. In <strong>Panel C</strong> — there is a <strong>QRs</strong> complex (<em>a wide and deep Q wave</em> but <em>a small and narrow terminal s wave</em>). Since there is <em>no</em> R wave at all in <strong>Panel D</strong> — we describe the complex seen as a <strong>QS</strong> complex (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><strong>Large</strong></em> vs <strong><em>Small-Case</em> Designation</strong> — <em>Large</em> deflections are denoted by <em>capital</em> letters. In contrast — <strong><em>smaller</em> deflections</strong> (<em>that do not exceed <em><strong>3 mm</strong></em> = 3 little boxes</em>) are denoted by <strong><em>lower-case</em> letters</strong>. Thus, we designate the QRS complex in <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 10.8-1 as an <strong>“rS”</strong> complex (<em>tiny initial r wave; deep S wave</em>). NOTE: The importance of recognizing that the <em>initial</em> deflection in Panel A is upright — is that <em>without</em> this tiny initial <em>positive</em> deflection, there would be a Q wave.</p><ul><li><strong>Panel B</strong> — is a <strong>qR</strong> complex. The initial <em>negative</em> deflection is small and narrow (<em>a q wave</em>). This is followed by a tall upright (<em>R wave</em>) deflection.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> — is a <strong>QRs</strong> complex. The initial deflection is not only deep, but also quite wide. We call it a <strong><em>large</em> Q wave</strong>. The tiny <em>negative</em> deflection following the tall R wave in Panel C is a small terminal s wave.</li><li><strong>Panel D</strong> — is designated a <strong>“QS complex”</strong>. Because there is <em>no</em> positive deflection (<em>R wave</em>) in Panel D — we are <em>unable</em> to distinguish between a Q wave, an S wave, or some <em>combination</em> of the two. <strong>QS complexes</strong> are commonly seen in the <strong><em>anterior</em> leads</strong>. They may or may not serve as a marker of infarction (<em>Section 09.10</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.9 – Summary: <em>When are Q Waves Normal?</em></strong></p><p>We summarize below *KEY *points brought out in Sections 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 — regarding ECG assessment for the presence and significance of <strong>Q waves</strong>:</p><ul><li>The <em><strong>bigger</strong></em> and <em><strong>wider</strong></em> a <strong>Q wave</strong> is — the more likely it is that infarction has at <em>some</em> time occurred. This is especially true IF there is <em>more</em> than one Q wave in a given lead area. That said — <em>some</em> leads may <em>normally</em> manifest even *large *Q waves that are <em>not</em> necessarily indicative of infarction. These leads are III – aVR – aVL – aVF – and V1 (<em>See</em> <strong>Figure 10.9-1</strong> — <em>previously discussed in Section 09.12</em>).</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Infarction Q waves may get smaller (<em>and even disappear</em>) with time. As a result — <em>small</em> size of a Q wave does <em>not</em> necessarily mean that no infarction has occurred.</li><li>Small <strong><em>septal</em> q waves</strong> — may <em><strong>normally</strong></em> be seen in one or more of the <strong><em>lateral</em> leads</strong> (<em>leads I,aVL; V4,V5,V6</em>). These <em>septal</em> q waves should <em>not</em> be confused with infarction q waves.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> correlation</strong> and <em><strong>comparison</strong></em> with <strong><em>prior</em> tracings</strong> is essential for optimal assessment of the meaning of Q waves. For example — Seeing small and <em>narrow</em> q waves limited to <em>lateral</em> leads in an otherwise <em>healthy</em> patient <em>without</em> acute ST-T wave changes strongly suggests that these q waves are benign.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.9-1:</strong> <em>“Reverse Z”</em> memory aid (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 09.12-1) — for recalling the <strong>5 leads</strong> that may display even <em>large</em> <strong>Q waves</strong> <em>and/or</em> <strong>T inversion</strong> as an <em>isolated</em> finding in otherwise <em>healthy</em> adults who do <em>not</em> have heart disease (<em>See text and Section 09.12 for more details</em>).</p><p>**10.10 – ECG Indicators of <em>Acute</em> MI: 4) *ST Segment Depression ***</p><p>We emphasized in Section 10.4, that with <strong><em>acute</em> coronary occlusion</strong> *— *the ECG leads that <em>overly</em> the area of infarction manifest <strong><em>acute</em> ST elevation</strong>. The opposite (<em>mirror-image</em>) picture is seen on ECG in <em>opposing</em> walls of the heart (<strong>Figure 10.10-1</strong>):</p><p><strong>Figure 10.10-1:</strong> ECG Indicators of <em>Acute</em> MI (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 10.3-1). With <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> (<em>ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</em>) — <strong>ST elevation</strong> is seen in leads that <em>overly</em> the area of acute infarction. The <em><strong>mirror-image</strong></em> picture (= <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong>) is seen in <em>opposing</em> walls of the heart (<strong>Panel 4</strong>).</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Clinical Points:</strong> Given the <em>many</em> potential causes of ST elevation <em>other than</em> acute STEMI (<em>Section 10.4</em>) — the ECG finding of <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> often provides an <strong><em>invaluable</em> clue</strong> that ECG changes are acute.</p><ul><li><em>Reciprocal</em> ST depression is <em>not</em> found in either early repolarization or acute pericarditis. The <em>persistent</em> ST elevation of ventricular aneurysm is also rarely accompanied by more than minimal ST depression.</li><li>The <strong><em>strongest</em> ECG evidence</strong> that ST elevation is <strong><em>truly</em> acute</strong> — is finding a virtual <strong><em>“mirror-image”</em> picture</strong> of <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression. This concept is well illustrated in Figure 10.10-2 — in which one can readily appreciate how the <em><strong>shape</strong></em> of the <em>inferior</em> ST depression in <strong>Panel A</strong> would take on the <em>shape</em> of the ST elevation in leads I,aVL — IF the tracing was to be <em>flipped over</em> (<strong>Panel B</strong> <em>in</em> Fig. 10.10-2).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.10-2:</strong> There is <em>marked</em> ST elevation in leads I and aVL. Note <em><strong>mirror-image</strong></em> (<em>reciprocal</em>) <strong>ST depression</strong> in <em>each</em> of the <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>leads II,III,aVF</em>). That is, the <em>depressed</em> ST-T wave seen in lead III from <strong>Panel A</strong> — would look virtually <em>identical</em> to the <em>elevated</em> ST-T wave shape in lead aVL IF in your mind’s eye you <em>flipped over</em> lead III (<strong>Panel B</strong>). With practice — you can readily recognize this <strong><em>mirror-image</em> picture</strong> that is characteristic of <em>acute</em> reciprocal ST depression (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Regarding <em>Reciprocal</em> ST Depression:</strong> The question arises as to <em>which</em> lead areas may manifest <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression with acute STEMI? Given the <em>cylindrical</em> configuration of the left ventricle — <em><strong>any other wall</strong></em> of the heart <em>not</em> showing ST elevation of acute STEMI <strong>may manifest <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong>. That is, with acute <em>inferior</em> MI — <em>reciprocal</em> changes may be seen in anterior, lateral <em>and/or</em> posterior walls.</p><ul><li>As was the case for ST elevation (<em>Section 10.4</em>) — the <em>greater</em> the amount of <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression and the <em>more</em> leads showing ST depression — the <em>larger</em> the size the acute MI is likely to be (<em>and the more the potential for benefit from acute reperfusion</em>).</li><li>CAVEAT: There are <em><strong>many</strong></em> potential <strong>causes</strong> of <strong>ST depresssion</strong> (<em>Section 09.26</em>). It will <em>not</em> always be easy to distinguish between ST depression due to <strong><em>primary</em> ischemia</strong> or some <strong><em>other</em> cause</strong> of ST depression (<em>LV “strain”; drug effect; electrolyte disturbance</em>) <em>—</em> vs <strong><em>reciprocal</em> changes</strong> in a patient with <em>acute</em> infarction. That said <em>—</em>** **<em>clinical</em> correlation with assessment of the <em>overall</em> 12-lead ECG will usually indicate the clinical course to follow.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**10.11 – <em>Acute</em> MI: *The Sequence of ECG Changes ***</p><p>Textbooks describe a sequence of <em>evolutionary</em> changes that occur during the course of <em>acute</em> infarction. For those patients who <em>“read the textbook”</em> prior to having their <em>acute</em> MI — <strong><em>schematic</em> Figure 10.11-1</strong> shows the typical <strong><em>evolution</em> sequence</strong> to expect during the course of an <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> (<em>ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</em>):</p><p><strong>Figure 10.11-1:</strong> The typical <em>sequence</em> of ECG changes to expect during the course of <em>acute</em> STEMI (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>Regarding the <strong><em>typical</em> sequence</strong> of <strong>ECG changes</strong> during <strong><em>acute</em> MI</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Panels A</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>B</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 10.11-1) — are <em>both</em> normal complexes. We include Panel A to remind that small and narrow **<em>“septal” <em>q waves</em></em> may be a <strong><em>normal</em> finding</strong> in one or more **<em>lateral <em>leads</em></em> (*I,aVL,V4,V5,V6 *— <em>Section 10.9</em>). In contrast, the <strong>Q waves</strong> of <em>acute</em> MI tend to be bigger and wider — and infarction Q waves often <em>increase</em> in size during the course of acute MI.</li><li><em>Special</em> NOTE: On occasion — <strong>small <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> may also be seen in one or more <strong><em>inferior</em> leads</strong> (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) as a <strong><em>normal</em> finding</strong>. This is especially true if the frontal plane axis is relatively vertical (ie, <em>close to 90 degrees</em>).</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> (<em>in</em> Fig. 10.11-1) — shows the <strong>"<em>hyperacute</em>" stage</strong>, which is the <em>earliest</em> change during <em>acute</em> MI evolution. This stage may be <em>subtle</em> — because there may be <em>no more than</em> minimal ST elevation. <strong><em>Hyperacute</em> T waves</strong> — are recognized by being broader <em>and</em> peaked — almost as if the T wave is &ldquo;trying&rdquo; to <em>lift up</em> the ST segment. Awareness of <em>hyperacute</em> changes is important — because it allows recognition of <em>acute</em> STEMI*-in-progress* at a time when <em>acute</em> intervention/reperfusion may provide <em>optimal</em> benefit. The <strong><em>hyperacute</em> stage</strong> is usually <em>short-lived</em> — and it may resolve <em>within</em> as little as 1-2 hours.</li><li><strong>Panel D</strong> — Conventional <strong>ST elevation follows</strong> (<em>with ST coving = &ldquo;frowny&rdquo; shape</em>) — and <em>developing</em> Q waves.</li><li><strong>Panels E</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>F</strong> — Q waves become bigger; ST segment elevation peaks and <strong>T wave <em>inversion</em></strong> begins. T waves evolve as the ST segment returns to baseline (<em>shown in</em> Panel F). <strong>NOTE:</strong> As opposed to the situation with <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> (<em>Section 12</em>) — the ST segment is often <em>still</em> a bit elevated with <em>acute</em> MI <em>at the time</em> that T wave inversion begins (<strong>Panel F</strong>). In contrast, with <em>acute</em> Pericarditis — the ST segment is <em>no longer</em> elevated in the <em>later</em> stage when there is T wave inversion.</li><li><strong>Panel G</strong> — ST-T wave abnormalities resolve (<em>or nearly resolve</em>) — but <strong>Q waves <em>persist</em></strong> and serve as a <em><strong>marker</strong></em> that infarction has taken place.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**10.12 – *Variation in the Sequence of Acute MI Changes ***</p><p>The <strong><em>A-<strong><strong>thru</strong></strong>-G</em> sequence</strong> from Figure 10.11-1 represents <em>expected</em> ECG findings for <strong><em>&ldquo;typical&rdquo;</em> evolution</strong> of <strong><em>acute</em> MI</strong>. That said — <em>Many patients do not read the textbook!</em> Variations on the general “theme” depicted in Figure 10.11-1 are common. Consider the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Q waves</strong> do <em>not</em> always develop (Caveat #1 — <em>in Section 10.6</em>). There may be <em>non-Q-wave</em> infarction.</li><li>When <em>infarction</em> Q waves <em>do</em> form — they may become smaller or even <em>disappear</em> over time.</li><li>ST depression <em>or</em> T wave inversion <em>alone</em> may at times be the <em>only</em> ECG change that is seen. The appearance of these changes does <em>not</em> always follow the sequence shown in Figure 10.11-1.</li><li><em>Acute</em> MI may develop in an area of the heart that is <strong><em>electrically</em> “silent”</strong>*. *For example — ECG changes may <em>not</em> always be seen (<em>or may be minimal</em>) when there is <em><strong>high lateral</strong></em> or <strong><em>apical</em> infarction</strong>. <em>Special</em> leads may be needed to visualize <strong><em>acute</em> RV infarction</strong> (<em>Section 10.31</em>).</li><li>There may be <strong>BBB</strong> (<em>Bundle Branch Block</em>) or IVCD that was <em>either</em> present before or developed <em>as a result</em> of the acute MI. BBB may <em>mask</em> the ECG signs of acute or chronic infarction (<em>Sections 05.24 through 05.29</em>).</li><li>There may be <strong>acute <em>posterior</em> MI</strong> — that produces a <em><strong>“STEMI-equivalent”</strong></em> pattern that manifests <em>anterior</em> ST <em>depression</em> rather than elevation (<em>Section 10.33</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**10.13 – *KEY <em>Points:</em> ECG Changes of Acute MI ***</p><p><em>Despite</em> the above cited potential variations in ECG presentation of acute <em>evolving</em> MI — awareness of the <strong><em>typical</em> sequence</strong> shown in Figure 10.11-1 will go a long way toward optimally <em>rapid</em> recognition.</p><ul><li>Focus on **<em>ASAP <em>recognition</em></em> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> (<em>or stemi-equivalent</em>) patterns — since these are the patients who are <em>most</em> likely to benefit from <strong><em>acute</em> reperfusion</strong> (<em>angioplasty/stenting</em>) of the occluded vessel. Even if positive troponins <em>later</em> confirm that infarction <em>did</em> occur — acute intervention is of limited (<em>if any</em>) benefit for <em>pain-controlled</em>, stable patients with <em>non</em>-STEMI (<em>Section 10.3</em> ).</li><li>Because ECG changes will <em>not</em> always be seen with <em>acute</em> MI and <strong>troponins</strong> may <em>initially</em> be <em>negative</em> — ***History ***becomes a <em>KEY</em> determinant for whether or not to admit a patient with chest pain to the hospital. As a general rule, IF at all in doubt — *Admit the *patient.</li><li>Have a <strong><em>low</em> threshold</strong> to **<em>Repeat <em><strong>the</strong> ECG</em></em> — especially if the patient has <em>ongoing</em> chest pain or if you are <em>uncertain</em> about whether the <em>initial</em> ECG represents an <em>acute</em> event. An acute <em>evolving</em> infarction may show changes in <em>as little</em> as 20-40 minutes!</li><li><em>Acute</em> ECG changes may be subtle (*as in the hyperacute stage = <em><strong>Panel C</strong></em> in *Figure 10.11-1). Look especially for <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> in lead areas <em>not</em> showing ST elevation to determine IF ECG findings are <em>likely</em> to be acute.</li><li>Use the concept of <em><strong>&ldquo;patterns of leads&rdquo;</strong></em>. That is, if <em>uncertain</em> about whether a Q wave or T wave inversion in <strong>lead III</strong> or <strong>aVF</strong> is <em>clinically</em> significant — look at the <strong><em>other</em> inferior lead</strong> (*which is *<em><strong>lead II</strong></em>). ECG changes in the <em>inferior</em> leads are much <em>more</em> likely to reflect ischemia/infarction IF present in <em>each</em> lead of the grouping (ie, <em>in II, III and aVF</em>). Similarly — chest lead abnormalities are more likely to reflect ischemia/infarction IF present in <em>more</em> than a single lead.</li><li>Use **<em>Prior <em>Tracings</em></em> to <strong>compare</strong>. <em>Go lead-by-lead</em>. Look <em>not</em> only at ST-T waves, but <em>also</em> at the QRS in <em>each</em> lead (*since axis change *and/or <em>lead placement errors may both affect ST-T wave appearance</em>).</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> A <em><strong>change</strong></em> in <strong>QRS axis</strong> from baseline to current tracing may alter ST-T wave appearance (<em>as well as resulting in Q wave appearance or disappearance</em>). Similarly — a <em><strong>change</strong></em> in the area of <strong>transition</strong> from baseline to current tracing may alter QRST appearance in precordial leads <em>without</em> this indicating that there has been interval change.</li><li><strong>PEARL:</strong> When the ECG was done — <strong><em>Was the bed</em> flat?</strong> If not — Note the <em>angle</em> of the bed when the ECG was recorded. Many patients are too sick to lie flat (<em>Q waves <em>and</em> ST-T changes may be produced by even small amounts of bed incline, especially in the inferior leads</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p>**10.14 – Assessing <em>Acute</em> ECG Changes **</p><p>Apply the concepts discussed in this section for assessing <strong><em>acute</em> ECG changes</strong> to the tracing in <strong>Figure 10.14-1</strong> — obtained from a patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain.</p><ul><li>Is there evidence of <em>acute</em> infarction? If so — Is this an <em>acute</em> STEMI?</li><li>Are there <em>reciprocal</em> changes?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.14-1:</strong> ECG from a patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. Is there evidence of an <em>acute</em> STEMI? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.14-1:</strong> The rhythm is sinus. All intervals and the axis are normal. No chamber enlargement.</p><ul><li><strong>Q-R-S-T Changes:</strong> There are large <strong><em>inferior</em> Q waves</strong> (<em>in leads II,III,aVF</em>) — and <em>small</em> q waves in V5,V6. Transition occurs normally (<em>between V3-to-V4</em>) — but there is subtle <em><strong>loss of R wave</strong></em> from V2-to-V3.</li><li>There is <strong><em>hyperacute</em> ST segment elevation</strong> in leads III and aVF. By the concept of <em><strong>“patterns of leads”</strong></em> (ie, <em>simultaneously looking at all leads in a given lead group</em>) — there is probably <em>also</em> some ST elevation in lead II with <strong><em>reciprocal</em> changes</strong> (<em>ST depression/T wave inversion</em>) in the <em>anterolateral</em> leads.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**<em>Clinical <em>Impression:</em></em> Sinus rhythm. <strong>Acute <em>inferior</em> MI</strong> (<em>as diagnosed by the presence of Q waves; ST elevation; reciprocal ST depression</em>). There is also probable <strong>acute <em>posterior</em> MI</strong> (<em>positive “mirror test” in V2,V3</em> — <em>See Section 10.33</em>).</p><ul><li>The <em>above-noted</em> changes in Figure 10.14-1 qualify as an <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> STEMI</strong> — as there is ST elevation associated with <em>acute</em> ECG changes in this patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. That said — it is difficult to “date” this infarction, because <strong><em>inferior</em> Q waves</strong> are already well established (<em>they are especially wide and deep in lead III</em>). Whether this is the result of <em>prior</em> inferior MI with <em>superimposed</em> new acute MI — vs <em>recent</em> inferior MI with <em>acute</em> extension — vs <em>rapid</em> evolution of a single <em>ongoing</em> event is uncertain. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> <em>Clinical</em> implications are similar <em>regardless</em> of whether the ECG in Figure 10.14-1 represents *old-plus-new *MI vs <em>single</em> new MI — since the <em>combination</em> of <strong><em>new-onset</em> chest pain</strong> plus <strong><em>acute</em> ECG changes</strong> (<em>ST elevation; hyperacute T waves; reciprocal ST depression</em>) means that the patient may benefit from <em>acute</em> reperfusion.</li><li>The phenomenon of <strong><em>Hyperacute</em> T waves</strong> is well illustrated in Figure 10.14-1 by T wave appearance in <strong>lead III</strong> (<em>and to a lesser extent in lead aVF</em>). Note that the T wave in these leads looks disproportionately tall and wide given the presence of ST elevation.</li><li><strong><em>Reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> — is also well seen in Figure 10.14-1 in <em>multiple</em> leads. In particular — Note the <strong><em>mirror-image</em> appearance</strong> of the ST-T wave in lead III <em>compared to</em> lead aVL.</li><li>**<em>KEY <em>Point</em></em>: The presence of both <em>hyperacute</em> T waves and <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression in <em>multiple</em> leads combine to strongly suggest that <em>despite</em> surprisingly deep and wide inferior Q waves — the ECG picture in Figure 10.14-1 is likely to be acute.</li></ul><p> </p><p>**10.15 – FIGURE 10.15-1: *Use of Serial ECGs in Acute STEMI ***</p><p>The ECG in Figure 10.15-1 was obtained from a patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain and <strong>obvious <em>acute</em> STEMI</strong>. <em>Follow-up</em> ECGs on this patient are shown in <strong>Figure 10.15-2</strong> (<em>obtained a short while later</em>) — and finally in <strong>Figure 10.15-3</strong> (<em>obtained post-cath/reperfusion</em>).</p><ul><li>Is there <em>evolution</em> of the MI on these <em>serial</em> ECGs?</li><li>Was acute <em>reperfusion</em> successful (Figure 10.15-3)?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.15-1:</strong> This is <strong>ECG #1</strong> (<em><strong>blue</strong></em>* border*) — from this patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. There is sinus bradycardia with marked <em>precordial</em> ST elevation. Q waves have <em>not</em> yet formed in the <em>anterior</em> leads on this <strong><em>initial</em> ECG #1</strong>. Note the <em><strong>hyperacute</strong></em> appearance of <strong>ST-T waves</strong> in leads V2,V3,V4. Surprisingly — <em>reciprocal</em> changes are minimal (<em>no more than slight ST-T wave flattening/depression in the inferior leads</em>). Despite this — there can be <em>little doubt</em> that this <strong>ECG #1</strong> represents a <strong>large <em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> in evolution.</p><p><strong>What is the <em>“Culprit”</em> Artery?:</strong> We suspect acute <strong><em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion</strong> as the <em>“culprit”</em> artery for the <em>acute</em> STEMI seen in Figure 10.15-1. As will be discussed in Section 10.25 — <em>proximal</em> LAD (<em>Left Anterior Descending</em>) occlusion is suggested by the ECG finding of <em>diffuse</em> precordial ST elevation that is especially <em>marked</em> in leads V2-to-V4.</p><ul><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Another finding in favor of acute <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion is that ST elevation is <em>more</em> marked in lead V1 than in lead aVR. In contrast — ST elevation tends to be more marked in aVR compared to V1 when there is left main disease.</li><li><strong>KEY <em>Clinical</em> Point:</strong> This patient is an <em>ideal</em> candidate for acute reperfusion — because there is <em>marked</em> ST elevation in Figure 10.15-1, but <em>no</em> anterior Q waves have yet formed. <em>Activate the cath lab ASAP!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p>Two <strong><em>follow-up</em> ECGs</strong> to Figure 10.15-1 are shown below.

Note that <strong><em>since</em> ECG #1</strong> — there has been interim development of <strong>RBBB</strong> (<em>an rSr’ complex is now seen in V1 <em>with</em> wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6</em>). The appearance of <strong>lead V2</strong> is concerning — as the large <strong><em>new</em> Q wave</strong> and now <strong>T wave <em>inversion</em></strong> in this lead suggest <strong><em>ongoing</em> evolution</strong> is in progress (<em>comparable to</em> <strong>Panel F</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 10.11-1).</p><p><strong>Figure 10.15-3:</strong> This is <strong>ECG #3</strong> (<em><strong>green</strong></em>* border*) — obtained after acute catheterization and angioplasty/stenting of the acutely occluded LAD. The “good news” — is that this <strong><em>post-cath</em> ECG #3</strong> is encouraging! Note that the QRS complex has <em>narrowed</em> and RBBB is <em>no longer</em> present. The <strong>Q wave</strong> seen earlier in lead V2 of ECG #2 has <em><strong>resolved</strong></em> — and ST-T waves have essentially returned to baseline. R wave progression is essentially normal (<em>with transition between V3-to-V4</em>). It appears that <strong><em>acute</em> reperfusion</strong> has <strong>salvaged <em>significant</em> myocardium!</strong></p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Use of <em>serial</em> ECGs may be extremely valuable in following the course of <em>acute</em> MI. <em>Lead-to-lead</em> comparison of QRS morphology and ST-T wave changes facilitates determining <em>which</em> changes are new — as well as providing insight to the likely benefit obtained from <em>acute</em> intervention.</p><p>**10.16 – The <em>Coronary</em> Circulation **</p><p>The most common cause of <em>acute</em> MI is <strong>sudden <em>total</em> occlusion</strong> of a <strong>major <em>coronary</em> artery</strong>.

Two of the most important anatomic variants are shown in Panels B and C:</p><ul><li>The two major vessels supplying the heart are the right and left coronary arteries. These most commonly arise from the right and left aortic sinuses, respectively (Panel A).</li><li>In <strong><em>most</em> patients</strong> (<em>80-90%</em>) — the <strong>RCA</strong> (<em>Right Coronary Artery</em>) is a <strong><em>dominant</em> vessel</strong> that supplies the RV (<em>Right Ventricle</em>) — and then continues as the <strong>PDA</strong> (<em>Posterior Descending Artery</em>) along the <em>undersurface</em> of the heart (<em>unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the RCA in</em> Panel A) to supply the <em>inferior</em> and <em>posterior</em> walls of the LV (<em>Left Ventricle</em>). Not shown — the <strong>AV nodal artery</strong> is most often supplied from the RCA.</li><li>As suggested in Panel A of <strong>Figure 10.17-1</strong> — the <strong>LMain</strong> (<em>Left Main Coronary Artery</em>) is typically a short vessel (<em>10mm</em>) that then <em><strong>bifurcates</strong></em> into the <strong>LAD</strong> (<em>Left Anterior Descending Artery</em>) and the <strong>LCx</strong> (<em>Left Circumflex Coronary Artery</em>).</li><li>Normally <em>—</em>** **the <strong>LAD</strong> runs along the <em>anterior</em> epicardial surface of the heart in the interventricular groove on its path toward the cardiac apex. The <strong>LAD</strong> generally supplies: <strong>i)</strong> the <em>anterior</em> wall of the heart (*via its *<strong><em>diagonal</em> branches</strong>); <strong>ii)</strong> the <em>cardiac</em> apex; and <strong>iii)</strong> a major portion of the conduction system (<em>via <em><strong><em>septal</em> perforators</strong></em> that run vertically down through the septum</em>).</li><li>The <strong>LCx</strong> (<em>Circumflex</em>) <strong>Artery</strong> *— *wraps around the <em>lateral</em> free wall of the LV (<em>Left Ventricle</em>). In most patients (ie, <em>when the RCA is dominant</em>) *— *the LCx becomes relatively <em>small</em> after giving rise to one or more <strong><em>obtuse</em> marginal branches</strong> that supply the lateral free wall (<em>dotted vessels arising from the LCx in</em> Panel A).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.17-1:</strong> Overview of <em>normal</em> coronary anatomy. <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>— <em>the most common situation (<em>80-90%</em>), in which the <strong>RCA</strong> is a <em>dominant</em> vessel that supplies the RV as well as the <em>posterior</em> and <em>inferior</em> walls of the LV. The <strong>LAD</strong> normally supplies the <em>anterior</em> wall of the heart (<em>via diagonal branches</em>); part of the <em>cardiac</em> apex; and a major portion of the conduction system (<em>via septal perforators that run vertically down through the septum</em>). <strong>Panel B</strong> <em>—</em></em></em> **represents a <em><strong>left-dominant</strong></em> circulation, in which the <strong>LCx</strong> (<em>rather than the RCA</em>) supplies the <em>posterior</em> and <em>inferior</em> walls of the left ventricle. <strong>Panel C</strong> <em>—</em> represents an <strong>LAD <em>“wrap-around”</em></strong> variant, in which the LAD also supplies part of the <em>inferior</em> wall as well as the <em>anterior</em> wall (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>**<em>Common <em>Variants in</em> Normal <em>Coronary Anatomy:</em></em> Figure 10.17-1 is purely schematic. Realize that numerous variations exist on the most common picture of <em>normal</em> coronary anatomy that is shown in <strong>Panel A</strong>. These depend on <em>anatomic</em> differences and extent of disease (<em>development of collaterals</em>) — <em>plus</em> any revascularization that may have occurred.</p><ul><li>Anatomic appearance also depends greatly on <strong><em>projection</em> angle</strong> for the <strong><em>basic</em> views</strong> that are shown (ie, <em>septal perforator branches appear longer when viewed from a less superior angle</em>).</li><li>Our discussion is limited to generalities.</li><li><strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 10.17-1) — represents a <strong><em>“left-dominant”</em> circulation</strong>. This anatomic variant is seen in ~15% of patients. In such cases — the <strong>RCA</strong> is a <em><strong>smaller</strong></em> vessel than depicted in Panel A. To compensate — the <strong>LCx</strong> is typically <em><strong>larger</strong></em> and gives rise to the <strong>PDA</strong> (<em>large unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the LCx in</em> Panel B).

Not surprisingly —infarction the patient with a “wraparound” LAD variant may be quite large. <em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Another reason for the occasional occurrence of <em>simultaneous</em> inferior and anterior ST elevation may be Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (<em>See Section 10.61</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>10.18 – The RCA:</em> Taking a Closer Look</em>**</p><p>In Figure 10.18-1 — We now take a <em>closer</em> look at normal (<em>expected</em>) coronary anatomy of the <strong>RCA</strong> (<em>Right-Coronary Artery</em>).

We show 2 septal branches in Figure 10.19-1 (<em><strong>S-1; S-2</strong></em>) — but instead there may be only one septal branch or <em>many</em> septal branches, depending on individual anatomy. The <strong>1st <em>septal</em> branch</strong> is typically the largest; its takeoff is generally <em>just after</em> the takeoff of the 1st diagonal branch.</li><li>The <strong><em>interventricular</em> septum</strong> is the most densely vascularized area of the heart.

In this way — there is usually a <em><strong>network</strong></em> of <strong>collaterals</strong> from <em>both</em> LCA and RCA systems in the event of disease in one system. How adequately collaterals from one system compensate for disease in the other is subject to individual variation (<em>as well as to how rapidly occlusive disease develops</em>).</li><li><em>Clinical</em> Note: Very <strong><em>proximal</em> LAD lesions</strong> have been known as <em><strong>“widow-makers”</strong></em>. Especially if proximal to the 1st septal perforator (<em>and the 1st diagonal branch</em>) <em>—</em> these lesions are virtual <em><strong>“left-main-equivalents”</strong></em> because of the extent of injury and conduction system damage they cause.</li><li><strong><em>Diagonal</em> branch anatomy</strong> is also highly variable. We show 2 diagonal branches in Figure 10.19-1 (<em><strong>D-1; D-2</strong></em>) — but there may be 1, 2, or 3 diagonal branches supplying the <em>anterolateral</em> wall of the heart. Occasionally — there is <em>no</em> diagonal branch per se, but rather a discrete <strong><em>ramus</em> intermedius</strong> arising from <em>between</em> the LAD and LCx to supply the anterolateral surface (<em>not shown on</em> Fig. 10.19-1). Typically — it is the <strong>1st <em>diagonal</em> branch</strong> that is the largest.</li><li><em>Clinical</em> Note Considerable variation in number and course of diagonal branch anatomy (<em>and the angulated path that these vessels follow</em>) may require multiple views on cath to determine if occlusion is present.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.19-1:</strong> Normal coronary anatomy of the <strong><em>left</em> coronary artery</strong> and its major branches.

This anatomic picture is <em>schematically</em> illustrated in <strong>Panel A</strong> of Figure 10.23-1 — in which the RCA can be seen to supply the RV (<em>Right Ventricle</em>) before transitioning to the <strong>PDA</strong> (<em>Posterior Descending Artery</em>). The PDA then continues along the <em>undersurface</em> of the heart as it supplies the <em>posterior</em> and <em>inferior</em> walls of the left ventricle (<em>unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the RCA in</em> Panel A).

For simplicity — We describe <em>expected</em> ECG findings assuming <em>no</em> prior infarctions and <em>no</em> alteration in collateral circulation.</p><ul><li>In the 80-90% of patients with a <em>right-dominant</em> circulation (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 10.23-1) — the most typical manifestation of <strong><em>acute</em> RCA occlusion</strong> is ST elevation in all 3 <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>II,III,aVF</em>) = <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> MI</strong>.</li><li><strong><em>Acute</em> RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricular</em>)** MI** — is likely to be seen when there is <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion (<em>Section 10.18</em>). More distal RCA occlusion may spare much of the right ventricle.</li><li>PEARL: <strong><em>Proximal</em> RCA occlusion</strong> is suggested when <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong>lead III</strong> is <em><strong>more</strong></em> than in lead II (*especially if there is <em><strong><em>marked</em> ST depression</strong></em> in *<strong>lead aVL</strong>). This picture is seen in <strong>Figure 10.23-2</strong>. In contrast — a <em>left-dominant</em> LCx occlusion is suspected when there is <em>inferior</em> MI with <em>less</em> ST elevation in lead III and <em>less</em> ST depression in lead aVL (<em>especially if there is significant ST elevation in leads V5,V6</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Posterior</em> MI</strong> — is commonly seen with RCA occlusion (<em>because the RCA most often supplies both inferior <em>and</em> posterior walls of the LV</em>). Posterior MI may <em>also</em> be seen with LCx occlusion IF there is a <em>left-dominant</em> circulation (<em>Section 10.17</em>). In <em>either</em> case — there will <em>usually</em> be ECG evidence of <strong><em>inferior</em> MI</strong> when there is <strong><em>posterior</em> MI</strong>. NOTE: The converse is <em>not</em> necessarily true — in that there may be acute inferior MI <em>without</em> associated posterior MI. <em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Rarely — <em>isolated</em> posterior MI may occur (<em>if the occluded artery is at the level of the PDA</em>). <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> We look for associated acute <em>posterior</em> MI when we see ECG evidence of acute <em>inferior</em> MI.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.23-2:</strong> Acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI from <strong>acute <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion</strong>. Note ST elevation in lead III > II with marked <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression in lead aVL. <em>Posterior</em> involvement is suggested by the ST depression in lead V2 (<em>positive “mirror” test</em>). There may also be acute RV involvement (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Additional Points regarding Acute RCA Occlusion:</strong> Keeping in mind the areas of the heart most commonly supplied by the RCA facilitates recognizing acute occlusion of this vessel (Figure 10.23-2):</p><ul><li><strong>Lead III</strong> is more rightward (<em>at +120 degrees</em>) than <strong>lead II</strong> (<em>at +60 degrees</em>). As a result — acute occlusion of the RCA generally produces <strong><em>more</em> ST elevation</strong> in <strong>lead III</strong> than in lead II (Fig. 10.23-2).</li><li>The electrical perspective of lead aVL is virtually <em>opposite</em> that of lead III. As a result — the <em>shape</em> of the <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> in <strong>Lead aVL</strong> often looks like the <em><strong>mirror-image</strong></em> of the ST elevation in <strong>lead III</strong>. ST-T wave changes in aVL are typically <em>marked</em> when there is <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion — and are generally more prominent than in lead I.</li><li><strong><em>Posterior</em> MI</strong> is suggested in Figure 10.23-2 — because of the <em>positive</em> “Mirror Test” for lead V2 (ie, <em>flipping lead V2 over would result in a Q wave with slight-but-real hyperacute ST elevation in this lead</em>). We discuss the <strong><em>“Mirror”</em> Test</strong> in more detail beginning in Section 10.33.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Associated <em>posterior</em> MI may be seen when acute <em>inferior</em> MI results from <em>either</em> RCA occlusion or a *left-dominant *LCx occlusion. However, associated <strong><em>acute</em> RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricular</em>) <strong>MI</strong> localizes the “culprit artery” to the <strong>RCA</strong> — because the right ventricle is not supplied by the LCx (<em>Left Circumflex Artery</em>). We discuss use of <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> and the ECG diagnosis of <strong><em>acute</em> RV MI</strong> in Sections 10.31 and 10.32.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> We suspect that there may also be associated <strong><em>acute</em> RV MI</strong> in Figure 10.23-2 — because the ST-T wave in lead V1 is relatively flat. Normally, with acute <em>posterior</em> MI — there is <em>similar-appearing</em> ST-T wave depression in <em>each</em> of the anterior leads (<em>V1,V2,V3</em>). In contrast, when there is <em>also</em> acute RV MI — *right-sided *ST elevation in lead V1 <em>cancels out</em> some of the ST depression that would have been seen from the <em>posterior</em> infarction. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> Suspect associated <strong><em>acute</em> RV MI</strong> with acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI from <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion — IF you see ST segment coving with slight ST elevation in lead V1. The finding of a flat (<em>instead of depressed</em>) ST segment in lead V1 (<em>as is seen in</em> Figure 10.23-2) — suggests that there may be some canceling out of V1 ST depression by acute RV ST elevation. IF important to know — <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> would help answer this question (<em>Section 10.31</em>).</li><li><em>Clinical</em> Note It is well to remember that <strong>2nd-degree AV Block, Mobitz Type I</strong> (<em>Section 02.72</em>) — is most often seen in association with <em>acute</em> RCA occlusion (<em>since the RCA usually supplies the AV nodal artery</em>).

Acute <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion has been known as a **<em>“widow-maker” <em>lesion</em></em> — because of the understandably <em>high mortality</em> associated with this event. This explains the <em><strong>urgency</strong></em> of <strong>recognizing</strong> the <em>uncommon</em> but <em>foreboding</em> ECG signs of <em>Wellens’</em> syndrome (<em>Section 10.54</em>) and — <em>DeWinter</em> T waves (<em>Section 10.57</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>10.26 – <em>Anterior</em> ST Elevation:</em> Not Always an Anterior MI</em>**</p><p>In the interest of clinical relevance — We feel it important to issue a <em><strong>reminder</strong></em> that the ECG finding of <strong><em>anterior</em> ST elevation</strong> is <em>not</em> always due to acute <em>anterior</em> STEMI. <strong><em>Other</em> Causes</strong> of <em>anterior</em> ST elevation that may need to be considered include: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Early</em> repolarization (<em>discussed in detail in Section 09.19 and Section 09.23</em>);** ii)** Pericarditis <strong>iii)</strong> LVH (<em>See below in</em> <strong>Figure 10.26-1</strong>); <strong>iv)</strong> LBBB; <strong>v)</strong> Takotsubo; and <strong>vi)</strong> LV aneurysm.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> correlation</strong> and comparison with <em>prior</em> tracings may sometimes be needed to distinguish such patterns from acute injury.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.26-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a patient with longstanding hypertension — illustrating <strong>ST elevation <em>not</em> due to <em>acute</em> MI</strong> (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 08.9-2). IF this patient were to be having “chest pain” at the time this ECG was recorded — it might be easy to misinterpret the several millimeters of ST elevation in leads V2,V3 as indicative of a new event. That said — it is far more likely that the <strong><em>anterior</em> ST elevation</strong> seen in the <em>blow-up</em> insert is an <strong>infarct <em>“mimic”</em></strong> and merely reflects the <em>reciprocal</em> of the LV “strain” pattern seen in lead V6 because:** i)** the dramatic increase in QRS amplitude and typical <em>“strain”</em> ST-T wave morphology in lead V6 <em>“shouts out”</em> that the patient has <strong>LVH</strong> and <em>not</em> an MI; <strong>ii)</strong> ST elevation is essentially <em>limited</em> to 2 leads; and** iii)** the <em>shape</em> of ST elevation in leads V2,V3 is concave up and the <em>mirror-image</em> reciprocal of ST-T wave depression in V6 (<em>vs ST coving that would be more characteristic of acute injury</em>).

This is because one normally associates acute <em>inferior</em> ST elevation with RCA occlusion — whereas acute <em>anterior</em> ST elevation is associated with LAD occlusion. A study by Sadanandan et al (<em>Am Heart J 146:653-661, 2003</em>) provides insight to <em>anatomic</em> explanation of this <em>unexpected</em> ECG finding. We integrate findings from the Sandanandan study while emphasizing the following <em>clinical</em> points:</p><ul><li><em>Approximately</em> 15% of patients with acute <strong><em>anterior</em> ST elevation</strong> <em>also</em> manifest <strong><em>inferior</em> ST elevation</strong>.</li><li>Surprisingly — about <em>half</em> of these patients with acute <em>anterior</em> and <em>inferior</em> ST elevation are found on cath to have <strong><em>proximal</em> RCA</strong> <em>rather than</em> LAD occlusion as the “culprit” artery. Presumably — this is a result of RCA marginal branches extending over to supply part of the anterior wall or some other collateralization pattern (<em>Section 10.18</em>).</li><li><strong>ECG Clues</strong> suggesting the <em><strong>“culprit artery”</strong></em> is the <strong><em>proximal</em> RCA</strong> <em>rather than <em>a wrap-around LAD are:</em></em> i)** ST elevation in <strong>lead III ></strong> lead II; <strong>ii)</strong> ST elevation in lead V1 > lead V3 (<em>as one would expect if there was acute RV involvement</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> Lack of progression of ST elevation as one moves from lead V1-to-V4 (<em>with LAD occlusion ST elevation tends to become more by leads V3,V4</em>).</li><li>In contrast — a <strong><em>“wrap-around” <em>LAD</em></em> should be suspected as the <em><strong>“culprit artery”</strong></em> IF:</strong> i)** ST elevation in <strong>lead II ></strong> lead III; <strong>ii)</strong> There is only <em>minimal</em> ST elevation in lead V1; and <strong>iii)</strong> There is *progressive *and <em>persistent</em> ST elevation as one moves from lead V1 <em>toward</em> leads V3,V4 (<strong>Figure 10.27-2</strong>).</li><li>Surprisingly — patients with <em>anterior</em> STEMI from acute occlusion of a <em>“wrap-around”</em> LAD do <em>not</em> necessarily have large infarctions. This is because the site of acute occlusion is <em>not</em> necessarily proximal, but may instead be in the mid- or distal-LAD.</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Another entity to consider for the presence of acute <em>simultaneous</em> inferior and anterior ST elevation is Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy — which may produce an ECG picture <em>similar</em> to that shown in <em>schematic</em> Figure 10.27-2.

This part of the LV is typically supplied by the <strong>1st <em>Diagonal</em> branch</strong> of the <strong>LAD</strong> (<em>and not by the LCx</em>).

While on occasion <em>acute</em> RCA occlusion may produce ST elevation in leads V5,V6 (ie, <em>if there is a large posterolateral branch arising from the PDA branch of the RCA</em>) — ST elevation in lead V6 should <em>not</em> be more than in lead III.</li><li>In <strong>Figure 10.28.2</strong> (<em>reproduced in the LOWER tracing of</em> Fig. 10.28-3) — We strongly suspect the <strong><em>“culprit”</em> artery</strong> is the <strong>LCx</strong> in a <strong><em>left-dominant</em> system</strong> because: <strong>i)</strong> ST elevation in lead III is <em>less</em> than in lead II; <strong>ii)</strong> There is <em>no</em> ST elevation in lead aVL; <strong>iii)</strong> There is <em>no</em> hint of acute RV involvement (<em>ST depression is prominent in V1 — whereas we’d expect either a flat or coved ST segment with slight elevation in V1 if there was associated RV involvement</em>); and <strong>iv)</strong> There is ST elevation in V5,V6 — and this ST elevation in lead V6 is clearly more than it is in lead III.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.29 – Acute <em>Right Ventricular</em> Infarction</strong></p><p><strong>10.30 – <em>Acute</em> RV MI: <em>Hemodynamics</em></strong></p><p>A substantial proportion of patients with acute <em>inferior</em> MI <em>also</em> manifest RV involvement. This is especially true when there is <strong><em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion</strong> — as suggested by the <strong>ECG signs</strong> of: <strong>i)</strong> ST elevation in <strong>lead III</strong> > lead II; and <strong>ii)</strong> <em>marked</em> ST depression in lead aVL that is more than in lead I (<em>Section 10.23</em>).</p><ul><li>The importance of recognizing RV involvement with <em>inferior</em> MI relates to its <strong><em>different</em> hemodynamics</strong> (<em>nitroglyercin not advised because it may excessively lower BP; volume-dependent hypotension that often responds well to IV fluid infusion; frequent need for extremely close ICU monitoring</em>).</li><li><em>Many</em> patients with acute <em>inferior</em> MI from RCA occlusion have at least <strong><em>some</em> degree of RV involvement</strong>. This should <em>not</em> be unexpected — given normal distribution of the RCA that typically supplies <em>both</em> the RV <em>as well as</em> the <em>inferior</em> wall of the LV. That said, even when there is <em>some</em> RV involvement — LV involvement often predominates. The <em><strong>KEY</strong></em> is to identify those patients at <strong><em>high</em> risk</strong> of <strong>decompensation</strong> from altered hemodynamics. Clinically — this may be suggested by: <strong>i)</strong> ECG evidence of a <strong><em>large</em> acute RV MI</strong> (<em>Section 10.32</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> The combination of <em>inferior</em> MI with borderline or low BP — especially if signs of <em>left-sided</em> heart failure (ie, <em>rales</em>) are absent; and <strong>iii)</strong> A <em>hypotensive</em> response to nitroglycerin — especially in patients with acute <em>inferior</em> MI.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Some emergency systems eliminate all use of NTG (<em>nitroglycerin</em>) in <em>any</em> patient with acute <em>inferior</em> MI. While realizing the rationale for this practice (<em>possibility of associated RV involvement with risk of inducing hypotension</em>) — global elimination of NTG for all patients with <em>inferior</em> MI is <em>not</em> necessarily needed or advisable. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> We suggest the following: <strong>i)</strong> Do <em>not</em> use NTG in <em>acute</em> MI patients when BP is low (<em>or relatively low</em>) — especially when hypovolemia is suspected; <strong>ii)</strong> Be especially cautious in patients suspected of having <em>significant</em> RV involvement; <strong>iii)</strong> Careful titration of IV NTG may be indicated in selected patients with adequate BP. In contrast — use of <em>sublingual</em> NTG in such patients may be <em>ill-advised</em> because of inability to take a sublingual dose back; and <strong>iv)</strong> You should follow the <em>standard-of-care</em> protocols put forth at your institution.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.31 – <em>Acute</em> RV MI: <em>Use of Right-Sided Leads</em></strong></p><p><em>Definitive</em> ECG diagnosis of <strong><em>acute</em> RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricular</em>)** MI** is made by use of <strong><em>right-sided</em> ECG leads</strong>. A <em>right-sided</em> ECG is performed using <em>similar</em> anatomic placement of precordial leads — except that chest leads are positioned on the <em>right</em> side of the chest (<strong>Figure 10.31-1</strong>).</p><ul><li><em>Right-sided</em> ECG leads are labeled V1R,V2R,V3R,V4R,V5R,V6R.</li><li>When obtaining leads V1R and V2R — one simply <em>reverses</em> the anatomic lead position of normal leads V1 and V2. That is — <strong><em>normally</em> placed lead V1</strong> will be the <strong>equivalent</strong> *of *<strong><em>right-sided</em> lead V2</strong> (<em>V2R</em>). Similarly — normally placed lead V2 will be the equivalent <em>of right-sided</em> lead V1 (<em>V1R</em>). This explains why <strong><em>normally-placed</em> lead V1</strong> is really a <strong><em>right-sided</em> lead</strong> (<em>Section 10.32</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.31-1:</strong> Anatomic landmarks for normal (<em>left-sided</em>) precordial lead placement (<strong>Panel A</strong> — <em>which was previously discussed in Section 03.6</em>). To obtain <em><strong>right-sided</strong></em> precordial leads (<strong>Panel B</strong>) — <em>similar</em> anatomic landmarks are used, but leads are placed on the <em>right</em> side of the chest (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>10.32 – <em>Acute</em> RV MI: <em>Making the Diagnosis by ECG</em></strong></p><p>As stated — ECG diagnosis of <strong><em>acute</em> RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricular</em>)** MI** is made by use of <strong><em>right-sided</em> ECG leads</strong>. The following findings should be looked for:</p><ul><li>ECG evidence of <strong>associated <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion</strong> (ie, <em><strong>acute inferior MI</strong></em>* with ST elevation in lead III > II* and <em>marked ST depression in lead aVL</em>).</li><li><em>Progressively</em> increasing ST elevation as one moves across <em>right-sided</em> leads. <em>Right-sided</em> ST elevation is often <em><strong>maximal</strong></em> in <strong>lead V4R</strong>.</li><li>ST segment coving or straightening (<em>especially if there is slight ST elevation</em>) in <strong>lead V1</strong> — in association with acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI (<strong>Figure 10.32-1</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.32-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG showing acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI. <strong><em>Proximal</em> RCA occlusion</strong> is suggested by ST elevation in lead III > lead II with marked <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression in lead aVL that is more than in lead I. <strong><em>Acute</em> RV MI</strong> is <em>suggested</em> by ST coving in lead V1 and <em>confirmed</em> by obtaining <em>right-sided</em> leads (<em>Note ST elevation in V2R through V4R</em>).</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Point: <em>Use of Lead V1 in</em> Figure 10.32-1:</strong> Although <em>right-sided</em> leads V2R,V3R,V4R confirm the diagnosis of acute RV MI in Figure 10.32-1 — these extra leads are <em>not</em> essential for making the diagnosis:</p><ul><li>As illustrated in Figure 10.31-1 — <strong>lead V1</strong> is really a <strong><em>right-sided</em> lead</strong>. Anatomic landmarks for placement of lead V1 are <em>the same</em> as they are for placement of lead V2R.</li><li>The <em>schematic</em> ECG in Fig. 10.32-1 shows <strong>acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI</strong>. Acute <em>posterior</em> involvement is suggested by the <em>shape</em> of ST depression in leads V2,V3 (= <em>positive “mirror test” — as will be discussed in Section 10.35</em>). When there is simply <em>posterior</em> infarction — <strong>lead V1</strong> will manifest a <em>similar</em> shape of ST depression as is seen in leads V2,V3. However, IF there is <em>also</em> acute RV MI — then the ST depression <em>that should have been seen</em> in lead V1 (<em>as a result of the posterior MI</em>) — will be <em>cancelled out</em> by the ST elevation in lead V1 from the <em>acute</em> RV MI. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> The fact that the ST segment in <strong>lead V1</strong> of <em>schematic</em> Figure 10.32-1 is coved (<em>if not slightly elevated instead of being depressed</em>) — strongly suggests that <em>in addition</em> to acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI, there is <em>also</em> <strong><em>acute</em> RV MI</strong>. This is different than the situation with acute <em>anterior</em> MI — in which case <em>not only</em> lead V1, but <em>also</em> other anterior leads will manifest ST elevation (<em>V2,V3,V4</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Notes: <em>Beyond-the-Core:</em></strong> Opinions vary as to the need for <em>additional</em> leads to make the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> RV MI. Depending on the ECG recording system used and experience of the person recording the 12-lead tracing — a certain amount of <em>additional</em> time will be required to obtain more than the standard 12 leads. This time may be minimal (<em>seconds</em>) — or it may take a <em>precious</em> minute or more. <em>You will not know how long it takes to get right-sided lead(s) unless and until you actually time yourself under real-life circumstances</em>.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Our</em> Bias:</strong> We prefer to <em><strong>start</strong></em> with <strong>12 leads</strong>. Much (<em>most</em>) of the time — 12 leads are <em>all</em> that will be needed in order to determine what you need to know to optimally manage the patient. That said — We fully acknowledge that there <em>are</em> times when additional leads may be extremely helpful.</li><li>Clearly, a balance must be struck between <em>urgency</em> of the situation — <em>How Long</em> it will take to obtain additional leads — and whether this time is really worth what you’ll <em>actually</em> learn from getting more leads. For example — IF there is obvious acute <em>proximal</em> RCA occlusion on <em>initial</em> ECG obtained by EMS providers in a <em>prehospital</em> setting — there is little to learn that will <em>change</em> management by spending extra time prior to transport in recording <em>right-sided</em> leads (ie, <em>the cath lab will need to be activated regardless</em>).</li><li>In a more stable setting when there is time to obtain <em>additional</em> leads — the most <em>sensitive</em> ECG indicator of <strong><em>acute</em> RV MI</strong> is the presence of <strong>≥1mm ST elevation</strong> in <strong>lead V4R</strong>. This finding may be transient — so <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> should be obtained <em>as early as feasible</em> when looking for RV MI.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Consider the situation in <strong>Figure 10.32-2</strong> — obtained from a patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain. Note that <strong><em>right-sided</em> leads</strong> = <strong>V3R</strong> and <strong>V4R</strong> have been obtained (<em>and are seen instead of leads V3,V4 on this 12-lead tracing</em>).</p><ul><li>Localize the area(s) of acute infarction.</li><li>What is the location of acute coronary occlusion?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.32-2:</strong> Acute *infero-postero *MI.

Note how <em>marked</em> ST elevation is in leads V3R and V4R.

Thus, the anatomic relationship of the “posterior” wall — is in reality <em>not</em> as directly posterior as depicted in Figure 10.33-1. Instead — what traditionally has been thought of as “posterior” wall involvement is more accurately referred to as involvement of part of the <em>lateral</em> LV wall.</p><ul><li>A new, more anatomically accurate terminology has been proposed.

Rather than confusing the issue with a novel ECG terminology that is *not yet *in general use — <strong>We favor <em>continued</em> use</strong> of the term <strong><em>posterior</em> infarction</strong> (<em>with continued distinction between lateral vs posterior walls of the heart</em>). We devote Sections 10.33 <em>through</em> 10.37 to recognition of <em>posterior</em> wall MI according to the <em>traditional</em> terminology that we use throughout this ePub. We realize that at some point in the future this terminology may change.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.35 – FIGURE 10.35-1: <em>Applying the Mirror Test</em></strong></p><p>We illustrate application of the <em>“Mirror”</em> Test in <em>schematic</em> <strong>Figure 10.35-1</strong>. The test is based on the principle that <em>anterior</em> leads provide a <em>mirror image</em> of electrical activity occurring over the <em>posterior</em> wall of the LV. We emphasize the following points:</p><ul><li>Most patients with acute <em>posterior</em> MI — <em>also</em> manifest ECG evidence of <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> MI</strong>. This is seen in the <em>lower</em> tracing (<strong>Panel B</strong>) of Figure 10.35-1 — in which there are small q waves and ST segment elevation in <em>each</em> of the <em>inferior</em> leads (<em>II,III,aVF</em>). In support of the diagnosis of acute <em>inferior</em> infarction — is <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression in leads I and aVL.</li><li>One looks for a <strong><em>tall</em> R wave</strong> in <strong>lead V1</strong> (<em>or at least taller-than-expected R waves in V2, V3</em>) plus a <em>peculiar</em> shape of <strong><em>anterior</em> ST depression</strong>. This is well seen in leads V1,V2,V3 <em>within</em> the <em>red rectangle</em> in <strong>Panel B</strong>.</li><li>Flipping the tracing over and holding it up to the light (ie, <em>performing the “mirror” test</em>) reveals that what was ST depression and a disproportionately <em>tall</em> R wave in <em>anterior</em> leads (<em>in</em> Panel B) — <em>becomes</em> a Q wave with worrisome ST elevation = a <strong><em>positive</em> “mirror” test</strong> (Panel A). This strongly suggests that in addition to acute <em>inferior</em> MI — there is <em>also</em> ongoing <strong>acute <em>posterior</em> MI</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.35-1:</strong> <em>Positive</em> “mirror test” — as seen when the upright initial ECG in Panel B is <em>flipped over</em> (<strong>Panel A</strong>) and held up to the light. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The <em>more</em> ST depression you see in <em>anterior</em> leads V1,V2,V3 (Panel B) — the *more *extensive the **<em>infero-postero <em>MI</em></em> is likely to be!</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The “mirror” test — is nothing more than a visual aid that we have conceived to facilitate recognition of <em>posterior</em> infarction (<em>Grauer K, circa 1983</em>). We have already seen application of this <strong><em>visual</em> aid</strong> to facilitate recognition of the <em>peculiar</em> shape of <em>anterior</em> ST depression in the example of acute* infero-postero-lateral* MI that was presented in Figure 10.28-3 — which we reproduce below in <strong>Figure 10.35-2</strong>.</p><p><strong>Figure 10.35-2:</strong> Illustration of a <strong><em>positive</em> “mirror” test</strong> in this patient with acute <em>infero-lateral-postero</em> MI due to acute occlusion of a <em>dominant</em> LCx (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 10.28-3). The original <em>upright</em> ECG is shown in the <em>lower</em> tracing (<strong>Panel B</strong>). Note ST elevation in leads II,III,aVF and in leads V5,V6 — consistent with acute <em>infero-lateral</em> MI.

Doing so (*as shown for leads V1,V2,V3 within the red rectangle in *<strong>Panel A</strong>) — reveals how the <em>anterior</em> ST depression and relatively tall R waves in leads V2,V3 of Panel B <em>become</em> Q waves <em>and</em> ST elevation when the tracing is flipped over.</p><p><strong>10.36 – FIGURE 10.36-1: <em>Anatomic Landmarks for Posterior Leads</em></strong></p><p>An alternative approach to using the <em>mirror</em> test — is the use of <strong><em>posterior</em> leads</strong> to diagnose or <em>confirm</em> diagnosis of <em>posterior</em> MI.

Because the PDA may arise from <em>either</em> the RCA or the LCx (*if there is a left-dominant circulation *— <em>as described in Section 10.28</em>) — it may <em>not</em> be possible by ECG to identify the “culprit artery” on those relatively rare occasions when there is <em>isolated</em> posterior MI.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Consider the ECG shown in Panel A of <strong>Figure 10.37-1</strong> — in which there is ECG evidence of <strong><em>isolated</em> acute <em>posterior</em> MI</strong>.

Practically speaking *— *the <em>majority</em> of <strong>acute <em>infero-postero</em> STEMIs</strong> will be the result of <strong>RCA</strong> (<em>rather than LCx</em>) <strong>occlusion</strong>, as ~85% of patients have a <em>right-dominant</em> circulation (<em>Section 10.17</em>). Recognizing that the <em>amount</em> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong>lead III</strong> is clearly <em><strong>more</strong></em> than in lead II *— strongly *favors RCA occlusion (*especially when there is significant <strong><strong>reciprocal ST depression</strong></strong> in *<strong>lead aVL</strong>).</p><ul><li>We next look to see IF there is <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong>leads V5,V6</strong>? IF there is <em>—</em> then the “culprit” artery could be <em>either</em> the RCA or a <em>dominant-left</em> Circumflex (<em>LCx</em>) artery (*since large postero-lateral artery branches may occasionally arise off the PDA from an RCA occlusion — as described in Section 10.18 — and as illustrated in *Figure 10.28-3).</li><li>BUT <em>—</em> IF there is <em>acute infero-postero-lateral</em> STEMI but <em>no</em> ST elevation in leads V5,V6 (<em>as is the case in</em> Figure 10.39-1) <em>—</em> it becomes highly <em>likely</em> that the “culprit” artery is the RCA (<em>since one expects ST elevation in V5,V6 with left-dominant LCx occlusion</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> A final reason to support our suspicion of <strong><em>acute</em> RCA occlusion</strong> for the ECG in Figure 10.39-1 *— *is the ST-T wave appearance in <strong>lead V1</strong>, which shows a <strong><em>flat</em> ST segment</strong> (<em>rather than ST segment depression</em>).</p><ul><li>In the presence of simple acute <em>infero-postero</em> MI <em>—</em> <strong>lead V1</strong> typically manifests a <em>similar-shape</em> ST segment as leads V2,V3. Thus, there should usually be <em>some</em> ST depression in lead V1 *— *albeit <em>less</em> than is usually seen in other anterior leads.</li><li>IF instead of being depressed *— *the ST-T wave in lead V1 is flat or coved (<em>or elevated</em>) *— *then <strong>associated <em>acute</em> RV</strong> (<em>Right Ventricular</em>) <strong>involvement</strong> is likely. This is because the ST elevation from <em>acute</em> RV MI that we would <em>expect</em> to see in <em>right-sided</em> lead V1 <em>—</em> is in part <em>cancelled out</em> by ST depression from the <em>posterior</em> infarction (<em>Section 10.32</em>).</li><li>IF there is a need to confirm acute RV involvement *— *then obtaining <em>right-sided</em> leads (<em>Section 10.31</em>) should tell us for certain.</li><li>Identification of <em>acute</em> RV involvement localizes the “culprit” artery to the RCA *— *because the LCx does <em>not</em> supply the right ventricle.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.40 – <em>Schematic</em> PRACTICE Tracings: <em>Acute MI/Ischemia</em></strong></p><p>As PRACTICE *— *We consolidate Review of the principles for <em><strong>identifying</strong></em> the <strong>probable <em>“culprit”</em> artery</strong> with <strong><em>acute</em> STEMI</strong> in the following 12 <em>schematic</em> tracings (<em>Sections 10.40.1 through 10.40.12</em>).</p><ul><li>For <em>each</em> of these <strong><em>schematic</em> ECGs</strong> *— *the rhythm is sinus and the patient presents with <em><strong>“chest pain”</strong></em>.

Thus, this <em>schematic</em> tracing is admittedly theoretical.

Because these q waves are small and narrow — the question arises as to whether they might represent <strong>normal <em>septal</em> q waves</strong> <em>instead of</em> infarction q waves? Small septal q waves may normally be seen in healthy subjects in one or more of the lateral leads.

That said — our interpretation of this <em>schematic</em> tracing would be as follows: i) <strong>Old <em>inferior</em> MI</strong>; and ii) <strong><em>Anterior</em> MI</strong> of <strong><em>uncertain</em> age, <em>possibly</em> acute</strong>. We would once again emphasize in our interpretation that, <em>“Clinical correlation is needed”</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Concept: <em>How to “Date” an Infarct?</em></strong> When assessing a <em>symptomatic</em> patient for the possibility of <em>acute</em> ischemia or infarction — ECG terminology frequently refers to the presence or absence of <strong><em>“acute”</em> changes</strong>. Given the importance of <em>prompt</em> revascularization for <em>acute</em> coronary occlusion — the GOAL is to identify <em>high-risk</em> patients with greatest potential for benefit. That said — Our ability to <em><strong>“date”</strong></em> an infarct is limited. Practically speaking — the <em>best</em> we can do is to classify ECG signs of infarction as <em>likely</em> to be: <strong>i) <em>Acute</em></strong>*; <em><strong>ii) <em>Old</em></strong></em>; *— or <strong>iii)</strong> Infarction of <strong><em>Uncertain</em> Age</strong>.</p><ul><li>Examples of <strong><em>“acute”</em> ECG findings</strong> are obvious in Figures 10.40-1 <em>through</em> 10.40-5. None of these tracings should pose any difficulty for recognizing the presence of <em>acute</em> MI.</li><li>The <em>addition</em> of <strong>History</strong> to the ECG picture — may provide <em>invaluable</em> assistance for determining <em>onset</em> of the event. This is especially true when chest pain is severe and begins <em>abruptly</em>.</li><li>In contrast — determining the likely “age” of an infarct <em>becomes</em> problematic when history for an “event” is indistinct (<em>minimal <em>or</em> only intermittent chest pain — <em>or</em> no chest pain at all</em>) *— *and when <strong>ECG signs</strong> are <strong><em>less</em> definite</strong>. This is the case for assessing the <strong><em>anterior</em> leads</strong> in Figure 10.40-8. The <em>very deep</em> QS complexes in leads V1 *through *V4 clearly suggest that <strong><em>anterior</em> MI</strong> has occurred at <em>some</em> point in the past. Q waves of this depth (<em>QS complexes</em>) generally require a certain amount of time to develop. That said — ST segments in leads V2 <em>through</em> V4 of <strong>Figure 10.40-8</strong> are <em>coved</em>, slightly <em>elevated</em> and associated with T wave inversion. Whether this picture is due to recent <em>anterior</em> MI — <em>new</em> anterior MI (<em>superimposed on old infarction</em>) — or <em>persistent</em> ST elevation from ventricular aneurysm will require <strong><em>clinical</em> correlation</strong> (<em>and comparison with prior tracings</em>) to sort out.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.40.9 – FIGURE 10.40-9: <em>Ischemia/Infarction?</em></strong></p><p>The rhythm in this <em>schematic</em> tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

In a patient with chest pain — we interpret these changes as suggestive of <strong>acute <em>inferior</em></strong> and <strong><em>anterior</em> STEMI</strong>. The question arises as to whether there is a <em>single</em> anatomic lesion that might give rise to these ECG changes that are seemingly occurring in 2 <em>different</em> lead areas?</li><li><strong>Probable <em>“Culprit”</em> Artery:</strong> — The left ventricular apex is often a difficult anatomic area to visualize on ECG. Changes may be subtle — or they may manifest in inferior <em>and/or</em> anterior leads. As emphasized in Section 10.27 — approximately 5-10% of normal subjects have an anatomic <strong><em>“wrap-around”</em> LAD</strong> as a coronary artery variant circulation. In such cases — the LAD is a larger and longer vessel, to the point of extending <em>beyond</em> the cardiac apex and <em>“wrapping around”</em> to supply the undersurface (<em>inferior wall</em>) of the heart. Thus, we suspect <em>acute</em> occlusion of a <strong><em>“wrap-around”</em> LAD</strong> as the <strong><em>“culprit”</em> artery</strong> in this case (<em>Section 10.27</em>).</li><li>As will be discussed in Section 10.61 — <strong><em>Takotsubo</em> Cardiomyopathy</strong> is <em>another</em> potential cause of acute ST elevation in <em>both</em> inferior and anterior lead areas.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.40.12 – FIGURE 10.40-12: <em>Ischemia/Infarction?</em></strong></p><p>The rhythm in this <em>schematic</em> tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

(<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>ANSWER to Figure 10.40-12:</strong> The ECG picture in this <em>schematic</em> tracing is clearly of concern. There is marked <strong><em>diffuse</em> ST depression</strong> in virtually <em>all</em> leads <em>except</em> for <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Impression:</strong> — The ECG pattern of <em>diffuse</em> ST depression in <em>multiple</em> leads (<em>usually in at least 7 leads</em>) — with ST elevation in lead aVR — is <em>highly</em> suggestive of <strong>3-vessel</strong> or <strong><em>proximal</em> LAD/<em>left-main</em> disease</strong>. This is especially true when this pattern is seen in an <em>older</em> adult who presents with chest discomfort (<em>Section 09.40</em>).</li><li>To emphasize <em>key</em> points regarding the recognition of this ECG pattern — We repeat below the PEARL <em>and</em> NOTE previously presented in Section 09.40:</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>PEARL:</strong> Distinction between <em>left-main</em> disease vs <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion may be suggested on ECG by the <strong><em>relative</em> amount</strong> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> seen in <strong>lead aVR</strong> <em>compared to</em> <strong>lead V1</strong>.</p><ul><li>Think <em><strong>Left-Main</strong></em> disease — when ST elevation in lead aVR > V1.</li><li>Think <strong><em>proximal</em> LAD</strong> disease/occlusion — when ST elevation in lead V1 > aVR. In Figure 10.40-12, given <em>marked</em> ST elevation in lead aVR in the <em>absence</em> of any ST elevation in lead V1 — one has to be concerned about significant <em>left-main</em> coronary artery narrowing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Distinction should be made between <strong><em>acute</em> LMCA</strong> (<em>Left Main Coronary Artery</em>)** occlusion** vs LMCA** disease.**</p><ul><li>Most patients with <em>acute</em> LMCA occlusion do <em>not</em> survive. As a result — this entity is <em>not</em> often seen and <em>unlikely</em> to be appreciated clinically. Rapid deterioration with patient demise due to cardiogenic shock is the usual result <em>unless</em> acute LMCA occlusion can be <em>immediately</em> recognized and <em>immediately</em> acted on.</li><li>In those <em>rare</em> circumstances when <em>acute</em> LMCA occlusion is captured on ECG — rather than diffuse ST depression there should be diffuse precordial ST <em>elevation</em> in association with significant ST elevation in lead aVR. Thus, the ECG picture in Figure 10.40-12 should <em>not</em> be misinterpreted as consistent with LMCA “occlusion”. Instead — it suggests that there may be significant LMCA <em>narrowing</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.41 – LIST #5: <em>Ant. ST Depression with Acute Inf.

This is because the RCA most commonly supplies <em>both</em> the <em>inferior</em> and <em>posterior</em> wall of the LV (<em>Section 10.17</em>). Even when the “culprit” artery is a <em>dominant</em> LCx instead of the RCA — acute <em>inferior</em> and <em>posterior</em> infarction will commonly be seen together (<em>Section 10.17</em>).

This patient with <em>new-onset</em> chest pain is in process of evolving a large <strong>acute <em>infero-postero</em> STEMI</strong>. Relevant findings include the following:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Dramatic</em> ST elevation</strong> (<em>with <strong><strong>hyperacute</strong></strong> ST segments</em>) in <em>each</em> of the inferior leads. ST elevation in <strong>lead III</strong> is <em>more</em> than in lead II — suggesting the <strong>RCA</strong> is the <em>“culprit”</em> artery (<em>Section 10.23</em>).</li><li>There is <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> in numerous other leads.

Note <em>taller-than-expected</em> R wave amplitude in lead V2 of Figure 10.43-1 — with the peculiar <em>shape</em> of ST depression in V2,V3 that characterizes acute <em>posterior</em> MI.

The cause of the <em>tall</em> R in V1 = <strong>RVH</strong> (<em>Section 08.23</em>). Note the following features in support of this diagnosis:</p><ul><li>RAD (<em>Right Axis Deviation</em>) — as determined by the markedly <em>negative</em> QRS complex in lead I.</li><li>RAA (<em>Right Atrial Abnormality</em>) — as determined by tall, peaked and pointed P waves in leads II,III,aVF.</li><li>RV “strain” in lead V1 — as suggested by ST-T wave depression in V1 that occurs in association with the tall R wave in this lead.</li><li>Persistent <em>precordial</em> S waves — as suggested by the deep S wave that is still present in lead V6.</li><li><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> Remember to think of RVH as the **<em>“detective” <em>diagnosis</em></em> that is generally made by a <em>combination</em> of ECG findings that occur in the <em>right</em> clinical setting (<em>Section 08.24</em>).</li><li>Practically speaking — By the time one sees as many ECG indicators of RVH in an <em>adult</em> as are present in <em>schematic</em> Figure 10.48-3 — the patient has either: <strong>i)</strong> <em>end-stage</em> pulmonary disease; and/or <strong>ii)</strong> pulmonary hypertension.</li><li><strong>NOTE:</strong> The finding of a relatively <em>tall</em> R wave in lead V1 is much <em>more</em> common in children — where it is <em>not</em> necessarily abnormal during the first few years of life (<em>Section 08.31</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.48-4:</strong> The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is narrow. <em>Why the tall R wave in lead V1?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.48-4:</strong> The rhythm is sinus. The QRS complex is narrow. There are small <em>inferior</em> Q waves and <em>marked</em> ST elevation consistent with <strong>acute <em>inferior</em> MI.</strong> ST depression is seen in leads I and in <em>anterior</em> leads V1,V2,V3. There is a <strong>positive <em>“mirror test”</em></strong> (<em>See below in</em> <strong>Figure 10.48-5</strong>).</p><ul><li><strong>Impression:</strong> We suspect the <em>tall</em> R in V1 is due to <strong>acute <em>posterior</em> MI</strong>. That said — the <em>other</em> 2 causes of <em>anterior</em> ST depression in LIST #5 may also be contributing (<strong>Figure 10.42-2</strong>). As emphasized in <strong>LIST #5</strong> — ST depression in leads V1,V2,V3 that occurs in association with acute <em>inferior</em> MI may be due to: <strong>i)</strong> <em>posterior</em> MI; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression (<em>in response to the acute inferior infarction</em>); and/or <strong>iii)</strong> <em>anterior</em> ischemia.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.48-5:</strong> Application of the <em>“mirror”</em> test to the <em>schematic</em> tracing shown in Figure 10.48-4.

The patient is an asymptomatic and otherwise healthy young adult. The ECG was obtained for screening purposes. <em>Why the tall R wave in lead V1?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.48-6:</strong> The rhythm is sinus. The QRS complex is narrow. We diagnose <strong><em>normal</em> variant</strong> as the <em>likely</em> reason for the moderately <em>tall</em> R wave (<em>R=S</em>) in lead V1 — by the <strong><em>process</em> of elimination</strong>. That is — the <em>other</em> causes in <strong>List #6</strong> must first be <em>ruled out</em>. We do this as follows:</p><ul><li>Since the QRS complex is *narrow *— the cause for the relatively <em>tall</em> R wave in lead V1 is <em>not</em> RBBB and <em>not</em> WPW.</li><li>This is <em>not</em> posterior MI — because: <strong>i)</strong> the patient is an asymptomatic and healthy young adult; <strong>ii)</strong> there is no ECG evidence of inferior MI; and <strong>iii)</strong> the “mirror” test is not positive.</li><li>This is <em>not</em> RVH — because: <strong>i)</strong> the axis is normal;** ii**) there is no RAA;** iii)** there is no RV “strain”; and <strong>iv)</strong> there is no persistent S wave in lead V6.</li><li>Admittedly — We can <em>not</em> rule out <strong>HCM</strong> (<em>Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy</em>) without an Echocardiogram. This does <em>not</em> necessarily mean that one needs to obtain an Echo on all patients with an ECG such as seen in <em>schematic</em> Tracing 10.48-6. <em>Clinical judgement is needed</em>. IF this patient was an athlete competing in high intensity sports <em>and/or</em> had a heart murmur or <em>positive</em> family history of <em>early</em> sudden death — then an Echo is clearly indicated. It is <em>not</em> necessarily needed without any of these factors.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>10.49 –</em> Hypertrophic</em> Cardiomyopathy: *How to Recognize on ECG? ***</p><p>Be aware of the 5th cause in List #6 of a <em>Tall</em> R in Lead V1 — which is <strong>HCM</strong> (<em>Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy</em>). Although <em>not</em> overly common — HCM is an important potential cause of sudden death (<em>especially in young athletes</em>). <strong>Echo</strong> <em>is diagnostic!</em> On the other hand — <strong>ECG findings</strong> are highly variable. These may include a moderately <em>tall</em> R wave in lead V1 as shown in <strong>Figure 10.48-6</strong> — and which indicates prominent* septal *forces. It might also include deep septal Q waves; LVH by voltage; IVCD/ LBBB — or <em>no</em> ECG changes at all. The reason for emphasizing <em>awareness</em> of HCM is the risk of <em>sudden death</em> that HCM poses among previously healthy young adults. While cost concerns prohibit mass screening by Echo of all young adults — Echo is indicated when there is a history of syncope during exercise; with a <em>positive</em> family history for <em>early</em> sudden death; when a <em>non-innocent</em> murmur is heard — or when a <em>pre-participation</em> ECG reveals <em>abnormal</em> findings that may be consistent with the diagnosis.</p><p>**10.50 – FIGURE 10.50-1: *WHY the Tall R in V1? ***</p><p>We conclude this segment on recognizing the cause of a disproportionately <em>tall</em> R wave in lead V1 — with the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 10.50-1</strong>. The patient is a middle-aged adult. No other clinical information is available. <em>What is the cause of the tall R wave in lead V1?</em></p><p><strong>Figure 10.50-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a middle-aged adult. No other clinical history is available. <em>Why the tall R wave in lead V1?</em></p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.50-1:</strong> The QRS complex looks to be slightly wide. The rhythm appears to be sinus — as suggested by the presence of an upright P wave in lead II. The PR interval in lead II looks normal. The QT is not prolonged. The most remarkable finding on this tracing — is the <strong>very <em>tall</em> R wave</strong> in <strong>lead V1</strong>. This is clearly <em>not</em> expected — and should prompt consideration of the 6 entities in <strong>LIST #6</strong> as a possible explanation. We suspect that the answer will probably <em>also</em> explain: <strong>i)</strong> the marked left axis (<em>and/or QS complex in inferior leads</em>); and <strong>ii)</strong> ST flattening and shallow T inversion seen in multiple leads. As we work through the entities on List #6 — We note the following:</p><ul><li>This is <em>not</em> a “normal variant” tracing. Other than the tall R wave in lead V1 — there is really nothing to suggest RVH (<em>no right axis; no RAA; no RV “strain” in lead V1</em>). And although it almost looks as if there are inferior Q waves — this is not the usual picture of inferior infarction, and the “mirror test” is <em>not</em> suggestive of posterior infarction.</li><li>Finally — the patient does <em>not</em> have RBBB. There is no rSR’ in lead V1 — and no S wave is seen in lead I. The QRS complex is also not as wide as is generally seen with bundle branch block.</li><li>The patient has <strong>WPW</strong>! It is important to appreciate that the QRS complex is <em>not</em> always overly wide with WPW. This is because there may occasionally be <em>simultaneous</em> conduction down <em>both</em> normal and accessory pathway — which will result in only <em>partial</em> pre-excitation (<em>Section 05.38</em>). It is <em>because of</em> awareness of <strong>LIST #6</strong> — that one looks <em>extra hard</em> for <strong><em>delta</em> waves</strong> whenever the finding of a tall R wave in V1 is seen. Close inspection reveals such delta waves are seen (<em>red and blue arrows in</em> <strong>Figure 10.50-2</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.50-2:</strong> Arrows highlight delta waves that were subtly present in the ECG shown in Figure 10.50-1. The QRS complex with WPW will <em>not</em> always be overly wide — as there may only be <em>partial</em> pre-excitation (<em>if impulses are simultaneously conducted down normal and accessory pathway</em>). Although the PR interval looks to be normal in lead II of this tracing — it appears to be <em>short</em> in leads V4,V5,V6 (<em>red arrows in these leads</em>). <strong><em>Delta</em> waves</strong> <em>are</em> present. They are <em>negative</em> in the inferior leads (<em>blue arrows</em>) — and <em>positive</em> in other leads in which they are seen (<em>red arrows</em>). No delta wave is evident in leads aVR, aVL or V2.</p><p><em><em>10.51 –</em> Giant</em> T Wave Syndrome **</p><p>We have already discussed on a number of occasions ECG recognition and clinical implications of T wave inversion. When <strong>T waves</strong> are <strong><em>symmetrically</em> inverted</strong> (<em>as they are in</em> <strong>Figure 10.51-1</strong>) — the possibility of <strong>ischemia</strong> should be strongly considered.</p><ul><li>Depending on the history — <strong><em>other</em> entities</strong> might also account for the <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion seen in Figure 10.51-1. For example, this could be due to <strong><em>acute</em> pulmonary embolus</strong> — IF the patient experienced <em>sudden</em> shortness of breath (<em>Section 08.37</em>). It could even be a <strong><em>normal</em> variant</strong> (<em>Juvenile T wave pattern</em>) — IF the patient in question was an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic child (<em>Section 08.31</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.51-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> ECG illustrating <strong><em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion</strong> in the <em>anterior</em> leads (<em>red arrows in leads V2,V3,V4</em>).

We reserve the term, <em><strong>“Giant T Wave Syndrome”</strong></em> — for a <em>select</em> number of clinical entities that produce <strong><em>truly</em> deep</strong> (><em>5mm amplitude</em>)** T wave inversion**. An example of this phenomenon is shown in <strong>Figure 10.52-1</strong>:</p><p><strong>Figure 10.52-1:</strong> Sinus bradycardia with <strong><em>Giant</em> T Wave Inversion</strong> that is present in <em>multiple</em> leads. As suggested by the <em>blow-up</em> insert — T waves <em>exceed</em> 10mm in size. A number of potential clinical causes should be considered (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Causes of <em>Giant</em> T Wave Inversion:</strong> Think of the following <strong>6 entities</strong> when you see truly <em>“giant inverted T waves”</em> in <em>multiple</em> leads:</p><ul><li>Apical (<em>Yamaguchi</em>) Cardiomyopathy.</li><li><em>Severe</em> CNS disorders (<em>increased intracranial pressure</em>).</li><li>Stokes-Adams attacks (<em>especially when due to severe bradycardia/complete AV block</em>).</li><li>Anterior ischemia/coronary artery disease.</li><li><em>Post-Tachycardia</em> Syndrome.</li><li><em>Massive</em> Pulmonary Embolism (<em>acute right heart strain</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Taking a <em>Closer</em> Look at the Causes:</strong> We highlight the following clinical points regarding the 6 common causes of <em>Giant</em> T Waves:</p><ul><li>*Giant *T waves were first described in association with <strong><em>Stokes-Adams</em> attacks</strong> — in which patients presented with <em>syncope</em> from <em>complete</em> AV block/bradycardia.</li><li>The most <em>bizarre</em> ECG changes occur with <strong><em>severe</em> CNS disorders</strong> (<em>stroke, subarachnoid or intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, coma, brain tumors, trauma</em>). Often — the QT interval will be prolonged (<em>sometimes markedly so</em>) with CNS catastrophes. In addition to <em>giant</em> T waves — there may be <em>marked</em> ST elevation that <em>mimics</em> acute MI.</li><li><strong>Apical</strong> (<em>Yamaguchi</em>) <strong>Cardiomyopathy</strong> — is a special form of HCM (<em>Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy</em>) in which the left ventricular apex is disproportionately involved. <em>Giant</em> T waves are highly characteristic. Although Echo is the diagnostic procedure of choice for detecting HCM (<em>Section 10.49</em>) — localized <em>apical</em> thickening may occasionally be <em>missed</em> by Echo (<em>and only picked up by MRI scanning</em>).</li><li>Deep, symmetric <strong><em>anterior</em> T wave inversion</strong> — may suggest <strong><em>coronary</em> ischemia</strong> from LAD (<em>Left Anterior Descending</em>) narrowing/occlusion (<em>Section 10.40.7</em>). Usually <em>other</em> clues in history (<em>chest pain</em>) or the ECG will be present — but on occasion, the diagnosis (<em>and indication to perform cardiac cath</em>) will <em>only</em> be forthcoming from <em>incidental</em> recognition of <em>giant</em> T waves.</li><li><strong><em>Post-Tachycardia</em> Syndrome</strong> (<em>as its name implies</em>) — follows an episode of <em>sustained</em> tachycardia. This is a <em>transient</em> phenomenon after SVT or VT that does <em>not</em> indicate infarction. Usually T waves are <em>not</em> overly deep.</li><li>Finally — *anterior *T inversion may suggest acute RV “strain” and be a sign of <strong>acute <em>pulmonary</em> embolism</strong> (<em>Section 08.37</em>).

(<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 10.53-1:</strong> The rhythm is sinus bradycardia. There is <em>marked</em> increase in QRS amplitude with <em>disproportionately</em> tall R waves in leads V1,V2,V3. Regarding ST-T wave changes:</p><ul><li>There is <strong><em>Giant</em> T Wave Inversion</strong> — with <em>depth</em> of these inverted T waves easily <em>exceeding</em> 5mm in multiple leads.</li><li>There is <strong>ST segment coving</strong> in several leads (<em>V2,V3,V4</em>) — albeit no significant ST segment elevation. There appears to be <strong><em>slight</em> J-point ST depression</strong> in most of the leads that manifest T wave inversion.</li><li>The <strong>QT interval</strong> appears to be <em>no more</em> than <strong><em>slightly</em> prolonged</strong>. We measure the <em>actual</em> QT at over 0.50 milliseconds (<em>more than 2.5 large boxes in duration in lead V3</em>) — but given marked bradycardia, the QTc is really <em>not</em> overly long.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>IMPRESSION:</strong> <em>All</em> of the entities discussed in <strong>Section 10.52</strong> should be considered as possible <em>contributing</em> causes of the <em>Giant</em> T Wave Inversion seen in <strong>Figure 10.53-1</strong>:</p><ul><li>This older adult has <strong><em>definite</em> LVH</strong> (<em>marked increase in QRS amplitude; ST-T wave abnormalities consistent with “strain” and/or ischemia</em>). Echo (<em>and possibly MRI</em>) would be needed to determine IF the patient had <em><strong>Yamaguchi</strong></em> (<em>Apical</em>) <strong>Cardiomyopathy</strong>.</li><li>Deep <em>symmetric</em> T inversion should always suggest <strong>ischemia</strong> — which may well be due to significant narrowing of the LAD. This would be more likely IF there was a history of chest pain prior to becoming unresponsive.</li><li>Given this patient’s <strong><em>unresponsive</em> state</strong> — the possibility of a <strong>CNS catastrophe</strong> (<em>stroke; bleed; trauma; post-seizure; metabolic disturbance</em>) needs to be strongly considered. That said — the QT interval will typically be <em>profoundly</em> prolonged when the cause of giant T waves is a CNS catastrophe, whereas the QTc in this case is <em>no more</em> than slightly prolonged.</li><li>We have <em>no idea</em> if this patient’s unresponsive state <em>could have been</em> preceded by an episode of ventricular tachycardia or a Stokes-Adams attack resulting from profound bradycardia with AV block.</li><li>Finally — <em>massive</em> pulmonary embolism may sometimes present with an unresponsive state, and could produce the giant T waves seen here.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> All 6 entities listed in Section 10.52 should to be considered as possible cause of the <em>Giant</em> T Waves in Figure 10.53-1.

Instead — patients who <em>only</em> manifest the <em>symmetric</em> T inversion of <strong>Panel A</strong> <em>might</em> have: <strong>i)</strong> milder (<em>non-critical</em>) coronary disease, which could be in <em>any</em> part of the LAD (<em>not necessarily the proximal LAD</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> any of the <em>other</em> causes of T wave inversion that were listed in Section 10.52; or <strong>iii)</strong> <em>no</em> heart disease at all.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.56-1:</strong> The ECG finding of <em>symmetric</em> anterior T wave inversion (<em>as schematically shown in</em> <strong>Panel A</strong>) — is <em>not</em> specific for a <em>proximal</em> LAD lesion.

While factors such as coronary spasm; disturbance of the microcirculation; coronary artery anatomic variation; and neurogenic myocardial stunning have all been implicated — their role is uncertain. What has been shown — is that <strong><em>abnormal</em> response</strong> to an <em><strong>increase</strong></em> in <strong><em>endogenous</em> catecholamines</strong> is almost always involved. Blood epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are <em>unmistakably</em> elevated (<em>sometimes dramatically</em>) in patients with Takotsubo CMP.</p><ul><li>In addition — there is <em>more-than-coincidental</em> <strong><em>preceding</em> occurrence</strong> of <strong><em>intense</em> situational</strong> or <strong><em>psychological</em> stress</strong> in many patients. This may be in the form of severe <em><strong>emotional</strong></em> stress (<em>death of a loved one; break-up from significant other; overwhelming anxiety/depression</em>) — <strong>pain</strong> — <em>and/or</em> <strong>fear</strong> (<em>from earthquake or other catastrophic event</em>). It is easy to understand the rationale for <em>other</em> names that have been used for this syndrome (ie, <strong><em>“Stress”</em> Cardiomyopathy</strong> or <strong><em>“Broken-Heart”</em> syndrome</strong>).</li><li>Although consensus is still lacking regarding specific criteria for defining Takotsubo CMP — there is general agreement that <strong><em>cardiac</em> cath</strong> is <strong>diagnostic</strong> (ie, <em>apical ballooning <em>but</em> no “culprit” artery</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>SUMMARY of the <em>Clinical</em> Picture:</strong> Takotsubo CMP is most typically seen in an <em>older</em> patient (<em>most often in a post-menopausal woman</em>) — who presents with chest pain or <em>new</em> heart failure. Look for the following features:</p><ul><li>Likelihood of <em>preceding</em> severe <em>physical/emotional</em> stress.</li><li><strong>Markedly <em>abnormal</em> initial ECG</strong> — often with diffuse ST elevation in <em>inferior</em> and <em>antero-lateral</em> leads (<em>apical or LAD ‘wraparound’ distribution</em>). Associated T wave inversion <em>and/or</em> Q waves (<em>sometimes deep</em>) may be seen. Acute extensive <em>STEMI-in-evolution</em> is frequently the <em>initial</em> diagnosis (<em>as was the case in</em> Figure 10.62-1).</li><li>Usually <em>no more</em> than <strong><em>modest</em> troponin elevation</strong> (<em>troponins are often elevated — <em>but</em> generally not nearly as high as expected given how marked ECG changes are</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Transient</em> LV dysfunction</strong> — which may be <em>severe</em> initially (<em>some patients present in pulmonary edema/cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump support</em>). LV function <em>usually</em> resolves <em>within</em> a <em>few</em> weeks.</li><li>Possibility of potentially <em>life-threatening</em> arrhythmias during the acute phase (<em>including VT/Torsades de Pointes</em>).</li><li><em>Absence</em> of pheochromocytoma, myocarditis or <em>other</em> underlying cardiac pathology to explain findings.</li><li><strong>Generally <em>favorable</em> prognosis</strong> (<em>often with full recovery within 1 month</em>) — but fatalities have been reported (<em>from LV free wall rupture; intractable pulmonary edema</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Variations on the above theme <em>do</em> exist. The syndrome of Takotsubo CMP is <em>not</em> limited to post-menopausal women — the ECG does <em>not</em> always show marked abnormality — and severe stress does <em>not</em> uniformly precede presentation.</p><ul><li>Anatomic areas <em>other than</em> the apex may also be affected. For example — there may be an <strong><em>“inverted takotsubo”</em> form</strong>, in which the apex is spared but the <em>base</em> of the heart is hypokinetic. The existence of such Takotsubo variants helps to explain the likely multifactorial etiology to this interesting syndrome.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em><em>Final</em> Clinical</em> PEARL:** Think of the possibility of Takotsubo CMP when confronted with a patient who presents with a <strong>markedly <em>abnormal</em> ECG</strong> that <em><strong>doesn’t quite “fit”</strong></em> the clinical picture.</p><ul><li>ECG findings may be <em>out of proportion</em> to clinical findings. ECG changes may involve several lead areas (<em>especially inferior <em>and</em> anterior precordial leads — which typically assess the cardiac apex</em>).</li><li>There may be an element of heart failure. Serum troponins may be positive.</li><li>The patient is usually an older adult (<em>especially a post-menopausal woman</em>).</li><li>There has usually been some form of severe <em>preceding</em> “stress”.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.64 – <em>Muscular</em> Dystrophy</strong></p><p>Among <em>non-ischemic</em> etiologies for markedly <strong><em>abnormal</em> ECGs</strong> in young individuals — is the series of <strong><em>muscular</em> dystrophies</strong>. The best known and most common of these is <strong><em>Duchenne</em> M</strong>uscular <strong>D</strong>ystrophy (<strong>DMD</strong>) — but there are more than 20 different genetic forms of these rare muscular dystrophy disorders. DMD occurs in ~1/3,000 boys (<em>it is an X-linked disorder</em>) — with unfortunate outcome of progressive muscle deterioration leading to death at an early age.</p><ul><li>Among the many other forms of muscular dystrophy is <strong><em>Becker</em> M</strong>uscular <strong>D</strong>ystrophy (<strong>BMD</strong>) — which is felt to be a <em>less</em> severe form than DMD. There are similarities among the different forms of muscular dystrophy (<em>re being genetic defects leading to progressive muscle weakness/deterioration</em>) — though variations exist depending on muscle groups affected and prognosis.</li><li>The defect in DMD is the absence of a critical muscle protein (<em>ergo rather than “dystrophy” <em>—</em> it is really a myopathy</em>).</li><li>Symptoms of DMD typically begin before age 5 (<em>sometimes in infancy</em>). The boy with DMD will lag in development. He may be clumsy, unbalanced, weaker and easily prone to fatigue.</li><li>“Pseudohypertrophy” (<em>enlargement of calf and deltoid muscles</em>) occurs — and may be an early sign (<em>due to replacement of injured muscle cells by fibrous or scar tissue</em>).</li><li>Progressive muscle weakness develops — beginning proximally (<em>legs, pelvis</em>) before spreading to other areas.</li><li>Diagnosis of DMD (<em>and other muscular dystrophies</em>) is suspected by increased CK levels on lab testing — and confirmed by muscle biopsy and genetic testing.</li><li><em><strong>DMD is uniformly fatal.</strong></em> The disorder is progressive and ultimately affects all voluntary muscles. The heart and respiratory muscle groups are typically affected by the teens. Myocardial deterioration (<em>cardiomyopathy</em>) and respiratory failure represent the major threat to life. There is no cure (<em>most boys die before age 25</em>).</li><li>Prognosis in <em>other</em> forms of muscular dystrophy is <em>not</em> necessarily uniformly fatal as it is in DMD. Cardiac involvement (<em>and ECG changes</em>) are common in many (<em>but not all</em>) of these other forms. Females may be affected in some of the other forms.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> It is well to be aware of the group of muscular dystrophies as one of the causes of a <strong>markedly <em>abnormal</em> ECG</strong> in a <strong><em>young</em> adult</strong> (<em>especially in males</em>). Given the variation in severity and presentation — the diagnosis of a form of muscular dystrophy might <em>not</em> always be known at the time an ECG is done.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>10.65 – <em>Muscular</em> Dystrophy: <em>Common ECG Abnormalities</em></strong></p><p>By young adulthood — the ECG with DMD <em>(and with many other forms of muscular dystrophy</em>) will usually be abnormal. Among the <strong>ECG abnormalities</strong> that are commonly seen include the following:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Abnormal</em> Q waves</strong> <em>not</em> due to infarction. These are most often seen in <em>lateral</em> leads.</li><li>Sinus tachycardia (<em>due to impaired cardiac function</em>).</li><li><strong>RBBB</strong> — that often manifests a peculiar <strong>polyphasic rsr’</strong> or rsr’s’ in lead V1.</li><li><strong>Tall <em>anterior</em> R waves</strong> — that may manifest surprisingly high amplitude. This may result in <em>early</em> transition or even as a <em>Tall</em> R in V1 (<em>Section 10.47</em>).</li><li>*Other *conduction defects may be seen — including <strong><em>nonspecific</em> IVCD</strong> with <em>unusual</em> QRS morphology.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> The ECG of a patient with muscular dystrophy may be markedly abnormal.

The wave is commonly linked to <em><strong>hypothermia</strong></em> — but <em>other</em> entities (<em>including CNS injury and ventricular fibrillation</em>) may also be associated with it. A number of <em>other</em> names have been attributed to this ECG finding (<em>“camel-hump” sign; hypothermic wave; prominent J wave</em>).</p><ul><li>The <strong><em>Osborn</em> Wave</strong> — is a <em>positive</em> deflection that occurs <em>just after</em> the QRS and at the <em>beginning</em> of the ST segment (<strong>Figure 10.67-1</strong>).</li><li>Osborn waves are often <em>not</em> seen until the temperature drops <em>below</em> -32 degrees Centigrade (<em>=89.6 degrees Fahrenheit</em>).</li><li>Other commonly <strong><em>associated</em> ECG features</strong> with <em><strong>Hypothermia</strong></em> include: <strong>i)</strong> Bradycardia (<em>which may be marked</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Atrial fibrillation; and <strong>iii)</strong> Artifact (<em>from baseline undulations resulting from associated shivering</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 10.67-1:</strong> Osborn wave — highlighted by the <em>red</em> arrow.

We suspect the rhythm is sinus based on what appear to be low amplitude P waves with a fixed PR interval in lead II (<em>and overall regularity of the rhythm</em>) — but it is difficult to be sure of atrial activity given the artifact. Frequent occurrence of atrial fibrillation in hypothermic patients is another potential reason for baseline undulations (<em>and another reason rhythm determination may be challenging</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Osborn</em> Waves</strong> are present. These are <em>especially</em> marked in leads V3,V4,V5 (<em>blue arrows</em>) — in which they attain <em>at least</em> 5 mm in amplitude! Osborn waves are also seen to a lesser degree in leads V2 and V6. They may also be present (<em>hiding in the terminal portion of the QRS complex</em>) in the inferior leads — but the distinct notching of an Osborn wave is absent in these leads.</li><li>Small inferior q waves are seen — but ST-T wave changes do <em>not</em> appear to be acute.</li><li>T waves appear prominent and somewhat peaked in V3,V4,V5.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Correlation:</strong> The patient’s core temperature on arrival was 30 degrees Centigrade (<em>86 degrees Fahrenheit</em>).

That said — the ECG may be of <em>definite</em> assistance in assessing <em>some</em> patients with <em>certain</em> types of electrolyte disorders, especially for explaining some of the ST-T wave abnormalities that may be seen. Consider the following:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Potassium</strong></em> — There is a surprisingly <strong><em>good</em> correlation</strong> between serum K+ (<em>potassium</em>) levels and the ECG when serum K+ is <strong>elevated</strong>. There are times when the ECG will be completed <em>before</em> blood results are back — strongly suggesting <em>not only</em> the diagnosis of hyperkalemia, but its <em>likely</em> severity (<em>and the need for immediate treatment even before serum value confirmation</em>). Unfortunately — correlation between serum levels and ECG changes is <em>poor</em> when serum K+ is normal or low (<em>Section 11.7</em>).</li><li><em><strong>Magnesium</strong></em> — is still <em>all-too-often</em> the <em>“forgotten”</em> cation. Hypomagnesemia is common when serum K+ is low. <strong><em>Low</em> serum Mg++</strong> (<em>magnesium</em>) <strong>levels</strong> produce virtually <strong><em>identical</em> ECG changes</strong> as <strong>hypokalemia</strong> (<em>Section 11.8</em>). On the other hand — <strong>Hypermagnesemia</strong> usually does <em>not</em> produce ECG changes <em>until</em> serum Mg++ levels are <em>markedly</em> increased (<em>usually >8-10 mEq/L</em>) — at which time there may be bradycardia, <em>prolongation</em> of PR/QRS/ QT intervals <em>and/or</em> AV block. <em>Clinical</em> hypermagnesemia to this degree is distinctly uncommon in clinical practice <em>unless</em> there is renal failure <em>with</em> Mg++ supplementation.</li><li><em><strong>Calcium</strong></em> — either in excess or deficiency, will <em>not</em> often produce <em>recognizable</em> effects on the ECG. That said — there <em>are</em> changes to look for: <strong>i) Hypocalcemia</strong> — typically <em>prolongs</em> the QT interval <em>without</em> affecting the subsequent ST segment; and <strong>ii) Hypercalcemia</strong> — may <em>shorten</em> the QT (<em>Section 11.1</em>).</li><li>**<em>Other <em>Electrolyte Disorders</em></em> (<em>including abnormalities in serum Sodium and Phosphorus</em>) *— *in our experience do <em>not</em> produce any specific (<em>recognizable</em>) ECG picture. That said, there will often be <em>more</em> than a single electrolyte abnormality at a time *— *so <em>additive</em> effects are possible.</li></ul><p> </p><p>In this segment — We <em>limit</em> discussion and illustration of*** electrolyte-induced* ECG Changes** to the following:</p><ul><li>Calcium disorders — <strong><em>Section 11.1</em>.</strong></li><li>Hyperkalemia — <em><strong>Section 11.3</strong></em>*.*</li><li>Hypokalemia — <em><strong>Section 11.7</strong></em>*.*</li><li>Hypomagnesemia — <em><strong>Section 11.8</strong></em>*.*</li><li>Discussion of <strong>U waves</strong> — <em>Section 11.9</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>11.1 – CALCIUM: <em>ECG Changes of Hyper- & HypoCalcemia</em></strong></p><p>As noted above — it will <em>not</em> be often that you will be able to look at an ECG and say, <em>“These ECG changes are due to an excess or deficiency in serum Calcium”</em>. There are <strong><em>several</em> reasons</strong> for this: <strong>i)</strong> ECG changes of hypo- and hypercalcemia are both <em>subtle</em> and often do <em>not</em> occur until excess or deficiency of this cation is marked; and <strong>ii)</strong> Calcium disorders are commonly associated with <em>other</em> metabolic <em>and/or</em> clinical problems. That said — it is still useful to be aware of the effect that Calcium disorders may have on the ECG. Consider the following:</p><ul><li><em><strong>HypoCalcemia</strong></em> — typically <em><strong>prolongs</strong></em> the <strong>QT interval</strong>. As a result — a <em>low</em> serum Calcium level is one of the causes in our <strong>LIST #3</strong> for a <strong><em>long</em> QT</strong> (<em>Section 06.2</em>). In theory — the ST segment is *not *affected by hypocalcemia, such that the T wave at the end of the <em>long</em> QT looks normal. This effect is <em>schematically</em> illustrated in <strong>Figure 11.1-1</strong> — in which compared to the situation when serum Calcium and the QT interval are <em>both</em> normal (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — a seemingly <em>unaltered</em> T wave is delayed in appearance by the <em>long</em> QT of hypocalcemia (<strong>Panel B</strong>). Clinically — the ECG picture seen in Panel B is typically <em>not</em> seen until serum calcium is <em>markedly</em> decreased. Even then, it may be difficult to distinguish the ECG effect of low serum calcium from that of other associated electrolyte disorders. <strong><em>Bottom</em> Line:</strong> <em>Don’t expect</em> to recognize hypocalcemia on ECG.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> — Be aware that <strong>Hypocalcemia</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> may occur <em>together</em> in patients with renal failure. Clinically — this <em>combined</em> electrolyte disorder may occasionally be suspected by the ECG finding of peaked (<em>pointed</em>) T waves with <em>narrow</em> base that occur at the end of a <em>long</em> QT (Panel C <em>in</em> Figure 11.1-1).</li><li><em><strong>HyperCalcemia</strong></em> — may <em><strong>shorten</strong></em> the <strong>QT interval</strong>. That said — <em>Don’t expect</em> to see QT shortening <em>until</em> serum Ca++ levels are <em>markedly</em> increased (<em>usually to more than 12mg/dL</em>). Even then <em>—</em> it will often be <em>exceedingly</em> difficult to distinguish between a QT interval that is normal (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 11.1-1) <em>—</em> vs a QT that is “short” with <em>early peaking</em> of the T wave (*as is theoretically seen with hypercalcemia — *<strong>Panel D</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 11.1-1:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> illustration of ECG changes with Calcium disorders. <strong>Panel A</strong> *— *the ST-T wave and the QT interval are <em>both</em> normal. <strong>Panel B</strong> *—*Hypocalcemia, which may lengthen the QT interval.

That said <em>—</em> there are <strong>3 elements</strong> about the history given and the ECG in <strong>Figure 11.2-1</strong> that should be cause for contemplation: <strong>i)</strong> There is no history of chest pain; <strong>ii)</strong> The patient has <em>advanced</em> lung cancer; and <strong>iii)</strong> The <em>shape</em> of the ST segment elevation is a bit “off” for acute STEMI.</p><p><strong>KEY <em>Clinical</em> Point:</strong> Despite <em>valid</em> concern about possible acute <em>infero-postero-lateral</em> STEMI (<em>either from a proximal right coronary vs dominant left circumflex occlusion</em>) <em>—</em> the <em>lack</em> of chest pain and <em>lack</em> of any defined <em>“onset”</em> of symptoms in the context of a patient with <em>advanced</em> cancer should prompt <strong><em>additional</em> data gathering</strong> <em>prior to</em> cath lab mobilization.</p><ul><li>Initial serum troponins were negative.</li><li>The patient was taken to the cath lab. <em>No</em> acute lesion and <em>no</em> significant coronary disease was found.</li><li>While in the cath lab <em>— additional</em> lab values returned showing a <em>markedly</em> elevated <strong><em>serum</em> Calcium</strong> value = <strong>17 mg/dL</strong>.</li><li><em>Comparison</em> ECGs were ultimately found. These were clearly abnormal. While a similar degree of ST elevation was <em>not</em> seen on prior tracings <em>—</em> there was definite ST segment coving with T wave inversion present on earlier tracings.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> SYNTHESIS:</strong> This case is admittedly subtle and complex. It is clearly <em>beyond-the-core</em> for the beginning interpreter. Nevertheless <em>—</em> We feel it is an excellent teaching example for emphasizing a number of clinical points that <em>are</em> of interest for providers of any level. These include the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>All ST segment elevation</strong> is <strong><em>not</em> necessarily</strong> the result of <strong><em>acute</em> coronary occlusion!</strong> In addition to common <em>“other causes”</em> of ST elevation (ie, <em>early repolarization variants; LVH; acute pericarditis</em>) <em>—</em> chronic ST elevation may result from either ventricular aneurysm or cardiomyopathy. This case serves to remind that <em><strong>Hypercalcemia</strong></em> is yet another <strong><em>potential</em> STEMI-mimic</strong>.</li><li>Textbooks describe <strong>QT interval <em>shortening</em></strong> as the principal ECG manifestation of <strong>hypercalcemia</strong>. That said <em>—</em> recognition that the QT interval is “short” is <em>not</em> easy to detect because: <strong>i)</strong> Usually <em>marked</em> hypercalcemia (<em>levels >12.0 mg/dL</em>) are needed before the QT noticeably shortens; <strong>ii)</strong> it will often be difficult to distinguish clinically between a QT interval that is within the “normal” range vs one that is “too short”; and <strong>iii)</strong> ECG manifestations of hypercalcemia are <em>superimposed</em> on any baseline abnormalities that may be present.</li><li>We mentioned that the <em><strong>shape</strong></em> of the <strong>ST elevation</strong> in this case was a bit “off” for <em>acute</em> STEMI. By this <em>—</em> we mean that the <em>coved</em> ST segments seemingly peak a tad <em>earlier</em> than is usually seen. That said <em>—</em> the <em>overall</em> QT interval in this case is <em>not</em> shortened. If anything <em>—</em> the overall QT interval is <em>lengthened</em> by <em>preexisting</em> T wave inversion that was seen to be present on <em>prior</em> comparison tracings.</li></ul><p> </p><p><em>BOTTOM</em> Line It is virtually <em><strong>impossible</strong></em> to <strong><em>attain</em> 100% accuracy</strong> in knowing <em><strong>when</strong></em> to <em><strong>activate</strong></em> the <strong><em>cath</em> lab</strong> based on assessment of a <em>single</em> initial ECG. Centers that boast an accuracy rate of 100% are clearly <em>missing</em> a certain percentage of <em>acute</em> MI patients who would probably benefit from early reperfusion.</p><ul><li>Occasional <em>false</em> activation of the cath lab is inevitable *— *and clearly <em>understandable</em> in this case given the ECG picture of ST elevation with T wave inversion and <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression. <em><strong>“Hindsight is 100% in the retrospectoscope”</strong></em> (Grauer <em>— circa 1980</em>). That said <em>—</em> the lesson to be learned is that the ECG is <em>not</em> a perfect tool *— *and the patient in this case gave <em>no</em> history of chest pain, and <em>no</em> defined onset of symptoms. There <em>are</em> times when <em>slight</em> delay before activating the cath lab is appropriate so that some <em>additional</em> evaluation can be performed.</li></ul><p> </p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Jiann Ruey Ong for allowing me to use the case and ECG from the patient whose tracing is shown in Figure 11.2-1.</p><p>**11.3 – HYPERKALEMIA: *ECG Manifestations/Clinical Features ***</p><p>The ECG may prove invaluable in <em>expediting</em> recognition of clinically <em>important</em> hyperkalemia. This is because with Hyperkalemia <em>—</em> there is a surprisingly <strong><em>close</em> correlation</strong> between <strong><em>serum</em> K+ levels</strong> and <strong>ECG</strong> findings. We highlight this relationship in <em>schematic</em> Figure 11.3-1:</p><ul><li><strong>Panel A</strong> — the serum K+ level is normal (<em>between ~3.5-5.0 mEq/L</em>). The QRS is of normal duration. The T wave is smooth.</li><li><strong>Panel B</strong> — shows <em>peaking</em> of the T wave, which is generally the <em>earliest</em> change of hyperkalemia (<em>K+ ~5.5-6.5 mEq/L</em>). This may initially be subtle.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> — The <strong>T wave</strong> becomes <em><strong>taller</strong></em> and <strong><em>more</em> peaked</strong> (<em>K+ ~6.5-7.5 mEq/L</em>). With progressive hyperkalemia — the T wave takes on an <em><strong>“Eiffel Tower”</strong></em> appearance. Not only is the T wave tall and peaked — but it manifests a <strong><em>narrow</em> base</strong> (<em>like the Eiffel Tower</em>). This is in contrast to the T wave that is sometimes seen in <em>healthy</em> individuals as a <strong><em>Normal</em> Variant</strong> (*lower right insert within *<strong>Figure 11.3-1</strong>) — in which the T wave is rounded, its sides are *not *symmetric (<em>slower ascent than descent</em>) — and the T wave has a <em>broader</em> base (<em>Discussed momentarily in Section 11.6</em>).</li><li><strong>Panel D —</strong> P wave amplitude decreases; the PR interval lengthens — and the QRS widens (<em>K+ >8 mEq/L</em>). Recognition of these ECG features signals potentially <em>life-threatening</em> hyperkalemia.</li><li><strong>Panel E —</strong> P waves often <em>disappear</em> at serum K+ levels >8-9 mEq/L. Yet <em>despite no longer</em> seeing P waves on the surface ECG — the rhythm is <em>still</em> initiated by SA nodal impulses (<strong><em>sinoventricular</em> rhythm</strong>). The result may be a <em>wide</em>-QRS rhythm <em>without</em> P waves that is <em>still</em> supraventricular (<em>due to associated hyperkalemia</em> — <em>See Section 11.4</em>). Eventually (<em>at serum K+ levels >9-10 mEq/L</em>) — the QRS complex becomes <em>sinusoid</em>. Ventricular fibrillation <em>and/or</em> asystole usually follow.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 11.3-1:</strong> ECG Manifestations of <em><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong></em>. Starting from a normal T wave (<strong>Panel A</strong>) *— *the T wave becomes progressively <em>taller</em> and more <em>peaked</em> from <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>K+~5.5-6.5 mEq/L</em>) to <strong>Panel C</strong> (<em>K+~6.5-7.5 mEq/L</em>) as it takes on an <em>“Eiffel Tower”</em> appearance. <strong>Panel D</strong> *— *P wave amplitude decreases; the PR interval increases; the QRS widens (<em>K+>8mEq/L</em>) <em>—</em> until the <em>pre-lethal</em> stage in <strong>Panel E</strong> (<em>K+>8-9 mEq/L</em>) with <em>sinoventricular</em> rhythm (<em>P wave no longer seen</em>); marked QRS widening; and ultimately a <em>sinusoidal</em> pattern prior to VFib or asystole. Note the difference in shape between the T wave in Panel C <em>—</em> vs the <strong><em>Normal</em> Variant</strong> pattern (<em>lower right insert — asymmetric T wave; rounder; with a wider base</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> At the bedside <em>—</em> our <em>first</em> inclination when told of an <em>elevated</em> K+ level <em>—</em> is to <em><strong>validate</strong></em> the <strong>reading</strong> (<em>and rule out hemolysis</em>). We do this by <em><strong>repeating</strong></em> the <strong>blood test</strong>.</p><ul><li>At times — simply obtaining an <strong>ECG</strong> may be a <em><strong>faster</strong></em> way to determine IF there is cause for concern. The <em>absence</em> of ECG signs shown in Figure 11.3-1* —* suggests that serum K+ is probably <em>not</em> significantly elevated.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Increasing</em> Incidence of HyperKalemia:</strong> Clinically <em>—</em> the incidence of Hyperkalemia continues to increase. This is <em>at least in part</em> because of the <em>increasing</em> number of patients on longterm dialysis.</p><ul><li>More patients have diabetes than ever before (<em>obesity epidemic in the general population</em>). These patients are living longer *— *so <em>more</em> of them than ever before go on to eventually <strong><em>require</em> dialysis</strong>. As a result *— *virtually all health care providers will encounter patients with hyperkalemia at some frequency.</li><li><strong>KEY <em>Clinical</em> Point:</strong> With rare exceptions (ie, <em>hyperkalemic periodic paralysis</em>) *— *Hyperkalemia does <em>not</em> usually develop unless there are one or more <strong><em>predisposing</em> factors</strong>. These should be inquired about in the history. Potential <em>predisposing</em> factors may include: <strong>i)</strong> Use of K+-retaining medications (<em>ACE-inhibitors; angiotensin-receptor blockers; K+-sparing diuretics</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Potassium supplementation; <strong>iii)</strong> Renal failure/dialysis; <strong>iv)</strong> Acidosis; <strong>v)</strong> Dehydration; and <strong>vi)</strong> <em>Severe</em> trauma.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>11.4 – Figure 11.4-1: <em>Ventricular Rhythm vs Hyperkalemia?</em></strong></p><p>Consider the 2 rhythm strips shown below in <strong>Figure 11.4-1</strong>.

(<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 11.4-1:</strong> Although our <em>initial</em> impression for <em>both</em> arrhythmias in this Figure is that a <strong><em>ventricular</em> rhythm</strong> is present in <em>each</em> case — this is <em>not</em> necessarily the correct answer. For example — IF told that each patient was hemodynamically stable and on <em>longterm</em> dialysis (or* had a history of chronic kidney disease*) — then a <strong><em>stat</em> serum K+</strong> value becomes <em>essential</em> for accurate diagnosis and <em>optimal</em> management.</p><ul><li><strong>Rhythm A</strong> (<em>in</em> Figure 11.4-1) — shows QRS <em>widening</em> — a <em>slow</em> ventricular rate (~<em>45/minute</em>) — <em>lack</em> of P waves — and suggestion of T wave peaking. In a patient on longterm dialysis — one has to consider <strong>hyperkalemia</strong>!</li><li><strong>Rhythm B</strong> — closely resembles AIVR (<em>Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm</em>) — as was discussed in Section 02.38. But IF this patient had renal failure — <em><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong></em> would <em>again</em> become a key consideration.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>BOTTOM Line:</strong> IF it turned out that <em>marked</em> hyperkalemia was the reason for the <em>wide</em> rhythms in Panel A and Panel B — then <em>rather than</em> Pacing/Atropine — the treatment of choice <em>would be</em> Bicarb/Calcium.</p><ul><li><strong>History is <em>ever</em> important!</strong> Sometimes a <em>stat</em> K+ level is needed for accurate diagnosis. Given the hemodynamically <em>stable</em> condition of each patient in Figure 11.4-1 — there <em>is</em> time for lab confirmation of the diagnosis.</li><li>Knowing that a hemodynamically <em>stable</em> patient with a <em>wide-QRS</em> rhythm <em>without</em> sinus P waves has <strong><em>renal</em> failure</strong> — goes a long way toward suggesting that what we are seeing in Figure 11.4-1 is a rhythm in a patient with <strong>hyperkalemia</strong> (<em>with changes in QRST morphology corresponding to that seen in</em> Panel D <em>or</em> Panel E <em>from</em> <strong>Figure 11.3-1</strong>). This is important since <em>optimal</em> treatment of this patient depends on <em>accurate</em> diagnosis of the reason for QRS widening.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>11.5 – Figure 11.5-1: <em>Ischemia vs Hyperkalemia?</em></strong></p><p>Consider the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 11.5-1</strong>. Clinically — What is <em>likely</em> to be going on? Is there ECG evidence of <em>ischemia</em>?</p><p><strong>Figure 11.5-1:</strong> <em>Ischemia</em> vs hyperkalemia? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 11.5-1:</strong> Sinus rhythm at ~100/minute. The PR interval is normal; the QRS and QT are <em>borderline</em> prolonged. <em>Rightward</em> axis. <em>No</em> chamber enlargement.</p><ul><li><strong>QRST Changes</strong> — There is a Q wave in lead I and there are QS complexes in leads aVL,V1,V2. Transition is slightly delayed (<em>occurs between V4-to-V5</em>). The most remarkable finding is the very <strong>tall, <em>peaked</em> T waves</strong> with <em>narrow <em>base (</em></em><em>“Eiffel Tower”</em>** <em>effect</em>) in at least <em>several</em> precordial leads. This strongly suggests <em><strong>hyperkalemia</strong></em> — perhaps with a <strong><em>serum</em> K+ ~6-7.5 mEq/L</strong> (<em>See</em> Figure 11.3-1). In addition, T waves are <em>inverted</em> sharply in leads III and aVF and there is some ST <em>depression</em> in <em>infero-antero-lateral</em> leads.</li><li>We would want to inquire from the history IF there were <strong><em>predisposing</em> factors</strong> (<em>such as renal failure</em>) to the <em>severe</em> hyperkalemia that we suspect from this tracing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTES:</strong> The ECG is the <strong><em>net</em> result</strong> of the heart’s electrical activity. Therefore — ECG changes from <em>new</em> hyperkalemia will be <em>superimposed</em> on any <em>preexisting</em> ST-T wave abnormalities.</p><ul><li>We’ll have to <em>wait</em> until hyperkalemia is corrected <em>before</em> knowing IF <em>abnormal</em> findings (<em>right axis; QS complexes; T wave peaking; ST depression <em>and</em> T inversion</em>) are due to ischemia <em>as well as</em> hyperkalemia.</li><li>In our experience — We have seen a great variety of <em>abnormal</em> ECG findings <em>disappear</em> once hyperkalemia is corrected. For unknown reasons — marked right axis (<em>as seen in</em> Figure 11.5-1) often resolves once serum K+ is again normal.</li><li>Note in Figure 11.5-1 — that the <em>negative</em> peak of the <em>inverted</em> T waves in leads III,aVF is sharp (<em>pointed</em>). Although <em>positive</em> peaked and pointed T waves are much more commonly associated with hyperkalemia — T wave peaking may occasionally be <em>negative</em> with this electrolyte disorder. We’ll only know for sure after serum K+ is corrected and a <em>repeat</em> ECG is obtained.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Be sure to <em><strong>repeat</strong></em> the <strong>ECG</strong> after hyperkalemia is <em>corrected</em> and <em>correlate</em> tracings to the <em>clinical</em> situation (ie, <em>chest pain with possible ischemia</em> vs <em>simple hyperkalemia?</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>11.6 – Figure 11.6-1: <em>Hyperkalemia vs Normal Variant?</em></strong></p><p>Finally, consider the ECG in <strong>Figure 11.6-1</strong> — obtained from a <em>healthy</em> 30-year old man. How might your interpretation <em>change</em> — IF the patient was <em>older</em> on <em>longterm</em> dialysis?</p><p><strong>Figure 11.6-1:</strong> Hyperkalemia vs <em>Normal</em> Variant? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 11.6-1:</strong> Sinus arrhythmia. <em>Normal</em> intervals and axis. <em>No</em> hypertrophy (<em>since the patient is only 30 years old</em>). T waves are peaked — and there is slight J-point ST elevation with an <em>upward</em> concavity (<em>“smiley” configuration</em>) in several precordial leads. <strong>IMPRESSION:</strong> Given that the patient is a young, otherwise healthy adult — this ECG almost certainly represents <strong>ERP</strong> (<em>Early Repolarization Pattern</em> — <em>Section 09.02</em>).</p><ul><li>But IF the patient was <em>older</em> with chronic kidney disease — then we would <em>definitely</em> <strong>check</strong> the <strong><em>serum</em> K+ value</strong>. Even though T waves here do <em>not</em> manifest the typical <em>“Eiffel Tower”</em> effect in that they had a <em>broad</em> base with <em>asymmetric</em> ascent and descent of the T wave (<strong>Figure 11.6-2</strong>) — all bets would be off IF the patient had renal disease or other potential reason for hyperkalemia. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> Clinical correlation is <em>key</em> to optimal interpretation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 11.6-2:</strong> Comparison of ECG characteristics for the T wave of hyperkalemia (<strong>Panel C</strong> — <em>reproduced from</em> Figure 11.3-1) — vs what is commonly seen as a <strong><em>normal</em> variant</strong> in otherwise healthy adults. Note that the T wave of <strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> (<em>in</em> Panel C) generally manifests a more peaked (<em>pointed</em>) T wave with <em>narrow</em> base and <em>symmetric</em> ascent/descent of T wave. In contrast — the T wave in a <strong>normal <em>repolarization</em> variant</strong> tends to be <em>rounder</em> with <em>wider</em> base and <em>asymmetric</em> ascent/descent of T wave. Exceptions exist — so <em>clinical</em> correlation is essential (<em>See text</em>).</p><p>**11.7 – HYPOKALEMIA: *ECG Manifestations/Clinical Features ***</p><p>In contrast to hyperkalemia — the ECG is <em>not</em> a reliable tool for assessing <em><strong>hypokalemia</strong></em>. While true that it is <em>unlikely</em> for the ECG to be “normal” IF clinically <em>significant</em> hypokalemia is present — <strong>ECG changes</strong> are often <em><strong>nonspecific</strong></em> — they may be <em>difficult-to-interpret</em> — and in our experience, ECG changes are <em>suboptimal</em> in ability to correlate with degree of severity. We highlight the following <strong><em>Clinical</em> Caveats</strong> regarding <strong>ECG assessment</strong> of <strong>HypoKalemia</strong>:</p><ul><li>Patients with hypokalemia do <em>not</em> always manifest ECG changes. In fact, the ECG of patients with even moderate hypokalemia may at times be <em>relatively</em> normal (<em>with little more than nonspecific abnormalities</em>).</li><li>In contrast — Some patients who have <em>normal</em> serum K+ levels <em>do</em> manifest ECG changes that seem to suggest they have hypokalemia.</li><li><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> The ECG is simply <em>not</em> very accurate as a tool for assessing either the presence or severity of hypokalemia. This is <em>not</em> to say that the ECG should not be monitored in patients with hypokalemia. On the contrary — <strong>ECG monitoring</strong> may be <em><strong>helpful</strong></em> in a number of ways. These include: <strong>i)</strong> Detection of <strong>arrhythmias</strong> (<em>PVCs are common with hypokalemia; risk of VT is increased</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> The <strong>QT</strong> (<em>or QU</em>) <strong>interval</strong> may be significantly <em><strong>prolonged</strong></em> with hypokalemia — with associated <em>increased</em> risk of Torsades de Pointes (<em>Section 06.3</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Serial</em> ECG changes that are followed as hypokalemia is treated and serum K+ returns to normal may provide insight to the likelihood of <strong><em>associated</em> ischemia</strong> — vs ECG abnormalities being <em>primarily</em> a result of the electrolyte disorder. <em>Clinical correlation is KEY</em>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>FIGURE 11.7-1: <em>What are the ECG Changes?</em></strong> Having conveyed potential clinical caveats of depending on the ECG to assess hypokalemia — We review in <em>schematic</em> Figure 11.7-1 those <strong>ECG Changes</strong> that <em>have</em> been associated with low serum K+ values:</p><ul><li><strong>Panel A</strong> — The ST-T wave is normal. This is the <em>baseline</em> tracing.</li><li><strong>Panel B</strong> — shows relative <em>flattening</em> of the T wave and ST segment. This is typically the <em>earliest</em> change.</li><li><strong>Panel C</strong> <em>and</em>** Panel D** — In association with ST-T wave flattening (<em>and often with some degree of ST depression</em>) — a <strong>U wave</strong> develops (<em>Section 11.9</em>). A* &ldquo;pseudo-P-pulmonale&rdquo;* pattern (<em>with P wave peaking in inferior leads</em>) may sometimes be seen.</li><li><strong>Panel E</strong> <em>and</em>** Panel F** — ST depression becomes more noticeable and the U wave increases in size (<em>red arrow in <em>Panel E) — until ultimately the U wave <em>overtakes</em> the T wave. At this point, distinguishing between the T wave and U wave may be almost impossible (ie, <em>there is really “<strong><strong>Q</strong></strong>-<strong><strong>U</strong></strong>" rather than “<strong><strong>Q-T</strong></strong>”</em></em></em> **<em>prolongation</em> — *as in *<strong>Panel F</strong>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 11.7-1:</strong> ECG Manifestations of <em><strong>Hypokalemia</strong></em>. Starting from a normal ST-T wave (<strong>Panel A</strong>) <em>— <em>the <em>earliest</em> change is ST-T wave flattening (<strong>Panel B</strong>). This may be followed by some degree of ST depression and development of a <strong>U wave</strong> (<em>in</em> <strong>Panel C</strong> <em>and</em></em></em> Panel D**). ST depression becomes more noticeable and the U wave increases in size (*red arrow in *<strong>Panel E</strong>) — until ultimately the U wave <em>overtakes</em> the T wave. At this point, distinguishing between the T wave and U wave may no longer be possible (<strong>Panel F</strong>). Despite this well described <em>sequential</em> evolution of ECG changes — many patients with hypokalemia “fail to read the textbook” (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>11.8 – HYPOMAGNESEMIA: <em>Clinical Features/ ECG Signs</em></strong></p><p>In our introduction to this segment on electrolyte abnormalities — We referred to <strong>magnesium</strong> as the <em><strong>“all-too-often forgotten cation”</strong></em>*. *Serum Mg++ is still often <em>excluded</em> from routine chemistry profiles in many institutions. As a result — <strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong> often goes <em><strong>undetected</strong></em> unless the clinician is aware of the need to <em>specifically</em> assess for this cation.</p><ul><li>Hypomagnesemia is common in clinical practice. As is the case for potassium — the vast majority (><em>98%</em>) of body magnesium resides <em>within</em> the intracellular compartment. As a result — serum levels (<em>measuring a minority of body magnesium that resides within the extracellular compartment</em>) do <em>not</em> reliably reflect body (<em>and intracardiac</em>) magnesium stores. Thus, it is not uncommon for a patient to have a serum Mg++ level that is still within the <em>low-normal</em> range (ie, <em>1.8 mg/dL</em>) — yet nevertheless having significant <em>body</em> depletion of this critical cation. <strong>Therefore:</strong> <em>Decidedly</em> low serum levels of Mg++ <em>are</em> diagnostic for hypomagnesemia — but blood levels in the <em>low-normal</em> range still <em>could</em> reflect low <em>body</em> stores that may nevertheless be clinically important.</li><li><strong><em>Certain</em> conditions <em>predispose</em></strong> to <strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong>. These include: <strong>i)</strong> associated electrolyte deficiency (<em>hypokalemia; hyponatremia; hypocalcemia; hypophosphatemia</em>);** ii)** Use of certain medications (<em>diuretics, digitalis</em>); <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Overuse</em> of Alcohol; <strong>iv)</strong> Diabetes and other metabolic disorders; <strong>v)</strong> renal disease; and <strong>vi)</strong> Certain <em>cardiac</em> conditions (<em>low Mg++ is common with acute MI; post-cardiac arrest; and in patients with various cardiac arrhythmias</em>). <strong>KEY <em>Clinical</em> Point:</strong> <em>Consider</em> hypomagnesemia (<em>even if the blood level is within the low normal range</em>) — in patients with any of the above potential <em>predisposing</em> conditions.</li><li><strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong> — may produce virtually <strong><em>identical</em> ECG changes</strong> as may be seen with <strong>hypokalemia</strong> (Figure 11.7-1). That is — the ECG of a patient with low serum Mg++ may <em>vary</em> from showing little more than minimal nonspecific changes — to showing <em>diffuse</em> ST-T flattening, ST depression, U waves, and <em>moderate-to-marked</em> QT (<em>or QU</em>) prolongation.</li><li>Clinically — <strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong> often <em><strong>coexists</strong></em> with <strong>hypokalemia</strong>. The importance of <em>not</em> overlooking <em>coexistent</em> hypomagnesemia is that hypokalemia may prove <em>resistant</em> to K+ replacement until serum Mg++ levels are restored to normal.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>11.9 – U Waves: <em>Definition/Clinical Significance</em></strong></p><p>The most commonly cited ECG sign of hypokalemia is the presence of U waves. A** U wave** is recognized as the ECG deflection that occurs <em>after</em> the T wave — but <em>before</em> the next P wave (<em>red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong> <em>of schematic</em> <strong>Figure 11.9-1</strong>). Physiologically — U waves are thought to represent repolarization of Purkinje fibers. We highlight the following clinical points about ECG recognition and the <strong><em>clinical</em> significance</strong> of <strong>U waves</strong>:</p><ul><li>U waves are <em>not</em> always present on an ECG tracing (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 11.9-1). When seen — they are often evident only in certain leads (<em>usually most easily recognized in leads II; V2,V3,V4</em>).</li><li>U waves are <em>not</em> specific for <strong>hypokalemia</strong>. They may <em>also</em> be seen with <em><strong>hypomagnesemia</strong></em> — <em><strong>LVH</strong></em> — <em><strong>bradycardia</strong></em> — or simply on <em>normal</em> tracings <em>without</em> other abnormality.</li><li>Like T waves — <strong>U waves</strong> may become <em><strong>inverted</strong></em> as a sign of ischemia (<strong>Panel C</strong>). This is usually quite subtle and <em>difficult</em> to see. To complicate recognition further — there may be ST depression with a <em>biphasic</em> terminal T wave (<strong>Panel D</strong>). As a result — <em><strong>We Suggest</strong></em> the following: IF not obvious on the patient’s ECG — <em>Do not worry about U waves!</em></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 11.9-1:</strong> <em>Recognition</em> of <strong>U Waves</strong> on ECG. <strong>Panel A</strong> — A U wave will not always be seen on ECG. When present, a <strong>U wave</strong> is recognized as the ECG deflection that occurs <em>after</em> the T wave — but <em>before</em> the next P wave (<em>red arrow in</em> <strong>Panel B</strong>). U waves are usually best seen in leads II; V2,V3,V4 — but they may be seen in any lead. They are <em>not</em> specific for hypokalemia (<em>U waves may also be seen with hypomagnesemia, LVH, bradycardia — and sometimes as a normal variant in healthy subjects</em>). <strong>Panel C</strong> — U waves may be subtle in appearance and they may be inverted (<em>sometimes as a sign of ischemia</em>). <strong>Panel D</strong> — It is <em>not</em> always easy to know if late baseline deflections reflect U waves or not (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>11.10 – Figure 11.10-1: <em>Electrolyte Disturbance or Ischemia?</em></strong></p><p>We conclude this segment on hypokalemia with the ECG shown below in <strong>Figure 11.10-1</strong>.

Are the ECG abnormalities seen likely to reflect <em>ischemia</em> or <em>electrolyte</em> disturbance? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 11.10-1:</strong> There is sinus arrhythmia. PR and QRS intervals are normal — but the <strong>QT</strong> is <em><strong>prolonged</strong></em> (<em>clearly more than half the R-R interval in lead II, as well as in other leads</em>). The axis is normal. No chamber enlargement.</p><ul><li>The most remarkable finding is diffuse <strong>ST-T wave flattening/depression</strong> with **<em>symmetric <em>T inversion</em></em> in leads V4,V5,V6. In addition — <strong>U waves</strong> are seen in multiple leads (<em>most obvious in leads V2,V3 = blue arrows</em>). The U wave in lead II (<em>large red arrow</em>) seems to <em>blend</em> with the T wave in this lead (<em>similar to</em> <strong>Panel F</strong> *in *Figure 11.7-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Impression</strong>**:** There are 2 principle abnormalities in Figure 11.10-1: <strong>i)</strong> A <em>long</em> QT interval; and <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Diffuse</em> ST-T wave flattening, some ST depression, and <em>symmetric</em> T wave inversion. <strong><em>Clinical</em> correlation</strong> is needed for optimal determination of <em>likely</em> etiologies. Comparison with a <strong><em>prior</em> ECG</strong> (<em>if available</em>) — would be extremely helpful in knowing whether the changes seen are likely to be new or old.</p><ul><li>The <strong><em>long</em> QT interval</strong> should prompt consideration of our <strong>LIST #3</strong> (<em>Section 06.2</em>). In brief — Consider: <strong>i)</strong> Drugs; <strong>ii)</strong> “Lytes” (<em>especially low K+ and/or low Mg++ given this patient’s history of alcohol abuse</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> CNS disturbance.</li><li><strong><em>Diffuse</em> ST-T wave abnormalities</strong> including ST flattening, ST depression and T wave inversion — should prompt consideration of our <strong>LIST #4</strong> (<em>Section 09.26</em>). Among potentially relevant entities to consider on this list in view of this patient’s history of alcohol abuse and chest pain are: <strong>i)</strong> drug effect (<em>if this patient was on digitalis or a diuretic</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> electrolyte disturbance (<em>especially low K+ and/or low Mg++</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> ischemia.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line</strong>**:** There is <em>no way</em> to be certain from this <em>single</em> ECG whether the abnormalities seen in Figure 11.10-1 represent ischemia — electrolyte disturbance — or some combination of these, perhaps in association with other factors.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> correlation</strong> including lab values, serial tracings and close follow-up of this patient’s clinical course — will be needed in order to know for certain. Even IF serum electrolyte values initially come back low — this would *not *exclude the possibility of <em>ischemic</em> T wave inversion <em>superimposed</em> on <em>electrolyte-induced</em> ST-T wave abnormalities.</li><li>That said — We <strong>strongly <em>suspect</em> hypokalemia</strong> (<em>and probably also hypomagnesemia</em>) are at least <em>in part</em> responsible for the ECG abnormalities seen in Figure 11.10-1 because: <strong>i)</strong> the history of alcohol abuse predisposes the patient to low K+/low Mg++ levels; and <strong>ii)</strong> the presence of very <strong><em>prominent</em> U waves</strong> in several leads plus <strong><em>marked</em> QT prolongation</strong> are both highly characteristic of these electrolyte disorders. Resolution of ECG abnormalities on serial tracings as electrolyte disturbance is corrected would confirm a <em>cause-and-effect</em> relationship.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>12.0 – <em>Acute</em> Pericarditis</strong></p><p>Pericarditis is an inflammation of the fibrous lining of the heart. The <strong>pericardium</strong> itself is a <em>double-layered</em> membrane which covers the heart, as well as containing the roots of the great vessels. There are <em><strong>2 layers</strong></em> to the <strong><em>pericardial</em> lining</strong>. These are:** i)** the inner <strong><em>visceral</em> pericardium</strong> (<em>which is attached to the epicardium, or outer layer of the heart</em>); and <strong>ii</strong>) the <strong><em>parietal</em> pericardium</strong> (<em>which is the outer layer of the pericardial sac</em>).</p><ul><li>Normally there is a potential <em>space</em> between the visceral and parietal pericardial layers = the pericardial “cavity”. Lubrication by a <em>small</em> amount of pericardial fluid allows <em>normal</em> free movement of the heart within the pericardial sac.</li><li>Problems arise when because of inflammation (<em>or other insult to the pericardial lining</em>) — the amount of pericardial fluid increases. This results in pericardial “effusion. In its extreme — there may be pericardial <em>tamponade</em>, with inability of the heart to contract within the pericardial sac due to massive effusion <em>and/or</em> rigidity of the sac itself.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Points:</strong> The finding on <strong>Echo</strong> of a <em>small</em> “pericardial effusion” — is usually a normal phenomenon. Some fluid is needed for normal lubrication between visceral and parietal layers.</p><ul><li><strong>Echo</strong> is an <strong><em>excellent</em> modality</strong> for detecting pericardial fluid and estimating the amount of fluid. Anything more than a “small effusion” is <em>not</em> normal.</li><li>Echo is invaluable as a bedside diagnostic aid for detecting larger effusions and determining IF pericardial tamponade is present.</li><li>Simple viral pericarditis (<em>the most common kind of acute pericarditis</em>) — often does <em>not</em> produce any abnormality on Echo because: <strong>i)</strong> The pericardium is a thin layer. Inflammation generally produces <em>no</em> abnormality detectable on echo; and <strong>ii)</strong> Uncomplicated viral pericarditis usually does <em>not</em> produce significant pericardial effusion. <strong>Therefore</strong> — A <em>normal</em> Echo does <em>not</em> rule out <em>acute</em> pericarditis. On the contrary — a “normal” Echo is the most common finding you will see.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>12.1 – <em>Acute</em> Pericarditis: <em>How to Make the Diagnosis?</em></strong></p><p>Pericarditis can be a <em>challenging</em> diagnosis to make. Recognition of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> may be facilitated by thinking of the diagnosis as a 3-part process. These <strong>3 components</strong> consist of: <strong>i)</strong> History; <strong>ii)</strong> Physical examination; and <strong>iii)</strong> ECG findings.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> The 1st step in making the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis rests with obtaining the history. Information regarding the patient’s <em>prior</em> medical history — <em>recent</em> health issues — and the presence and nature of <em><strong>symptoms</strong></em> are all relevant.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Potential</em> Etiologies</strong> of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> are <em>many</em> and extend <em>beyond</em> the scope of this ECG-2014-ePub. The most common scenario is acute or recent <strong><em>viral</em> illness</strong> occurring in a relatively <em>young</em> adult. Almost any viral agent may be responsible. That said — identification of the specific causative agent (ie, <em>by obtaining acute viral studies</em>) is often <em>not</em> undertaken because most cases of <strong>acute <em>viral</em> pericarditis</strong> (<em>also known as <strong><strong>“idiopathic”</strong></strong> pericarditis</em>) — are relatively benign, <em>spontaneously</em> resolve and do <em>not</em> recur. Knowing which virus is the “culprit” agent does <em>not</em> alter treatment, is expensive, and does <em>not</em> affect the ultimate course in most patients. <strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Given that <strong><em>up to</em> 90%</strong> of all cases of acute pericarditis occurring in out-patients are viral (<em>idiopathic</em>) and usually occurring in <em>otherwise</em> healthy adults — <strong><em>KEY</em> Questions</strong> to ask relate to: <strong>i)</strong> Whether there is a history of <em>preceding</em> viral illness; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Prior</em> health status; and <strong>iii)</strong> <em>Previous</em> episodes (<em>viral pericarditis may recur, though this is not common</em>).</li><li><em>KEY</em> Point A <em><strong>different</strong></em> set of <strong><em>diagnostic</em> considerations</strong> should be contemplated when considering acute pericarditis in an <strong><em>older</em> patient</strong> with <strong><em>underlying</em> medical disorders</strong>. Among the many possible <em>other</em> etiologies for pericarditis include: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Non-viral</em> infections (<em>tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal septicemia; immunocompromise</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Uremia (<em>pericarditis is a common complication of end-stage renal disease</em>); <strong>iii)</strong> Malignancy (<em>metastasis to the pericardium</em>); <strong>iv)</strong> Collagen vascular disease (<em>rheumatoid arthritis; lupus; scleroderma</em>); <strong>v)</strong> <em>Post-radiation</em> pericarditis; <strong>vi)</strong> Chest trauma; <strong>vii)</strong> Post-myocardial infarction pericarditis (<em>Dressler syndrome</em>); <strong>viii)</strong> <em>Post-pericardiotomy</em> syndrome; and <strong>ix)</strong> Still <em>other</em> causes. <strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE:</strong> Pericarditis caused by <em>any</em> of the above entities is usually a <strong><em>different</em> disease</strong> than uncomplicated <em>viral</em> pericarditis that occurs in a previously healthy young adult. The course is often far more severe, longer lasting, and much more likely to be associated with pericardial effusion <em>and/or</em> tamponade. Awareness of the patient’s <strong>past <em>medical</em> history</strong> may be <em>KEY</em> to suspecting the diagnosis for these other forms of <em>non-viral</em> pericarditis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> We <em>limit</em> discussion of symptoms to*** Chest* Discomfort**. Fever and dyspnea may also be seen with <em>acute</em> pericarditis *— *but these symptoms are nonspecific. The <strong><em>chest</em> pain</strong> associated with <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> may be moderate or severe. It is characterized by being: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Pleuritic</em>; and <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Positional</em> in nature.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Pleuritic</em> chest pain</strong> — is often sharp in nature and increases with inspiration (<em>a result of associated pleural inflammation</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Positional</em> chest pain</strong> — is typically relieved by sitting up and exacerbated by lying supine (<em>lying supine stretches the inflamed pericardium — whereas sitting up takes tension off the inflamed pericardium</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> NOTE #1:</strong> Although the nature and severity of chest pain associated with <em>acute</em> pericarditis is highly variable — eliciting a <em><strong>pleuritic</strong></em> and/or <strong><em>positional</em> component</strong> can be very helpful in suspecting the diagnosis, especially when the patient is a previously healthy young adult.</li><li>**<em>Clinical <em>NOTE #2:</em></em> Given the common diagnostic dilemma of distinguishing between <strong>ERP</strong> (<em>Early Repolarization Pattern</em>) vs Pericarditis (<em>Section 12.9</em>) — it is helpful to remember that <strong>acute <em>viral</em> pericarditis</strong> is *very *<em><strong>unlikely</strong></em> in the <em><strong>absence</strong></em> of <strong>symptoms</strong>. In contrast — chest pain is <em>less</em> uniformly present in some of the other <em>non-viral</em> etiologies of <em>acute</em> pericarditis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Physical</em> Examination:</strong> There are <strong>2 Goals</strong> of physical exam: <strong>i)</strong> To try to make a <em>definitive</em> diagnosis by hearing a <strong>pericardial <em>friction</em> rub</strong>; and ii) to **<em>rule <em>out</em> other <em>causes</em></em> of chest discomfort (<em>pulmonary problems; musculoskeletal pain; herpes zoster; etc.</em>).</p><ul><li>Characteristics of a pericardial <em>friction</em> rub are that it is a <strong>scratchy, <em>superficial</em> sound</strong> (<em>like walking on snow</em>). There may be only one or several components to the rub. It may wax and wane in loudness — often becoming louder during inspiration. The rub is often transient, and may be intermittent — so it is worthwhile auscultating the patient on <em>at least</em> several occasions. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> IF a pericardial friction rub is heard — then the diagnosis of acute pericarditis is made! However — <em>not</em> hearing a rub does <em>not</em> rule out pericarditis. <strong><em>Clinical</em> Reality:</strong> Despite a cited incidence in the literature of well <em>over</em> 50% of patients with <em>acute</em> pericarditis having a rub at some point during their course — the diagnosis of many (<em>if not most</em>) cases of <em>acute</em> pericarditis is made in the <em>absence</em> of hearing a rub.</li><li>As noted above — the history for <em>acute</em> pericarditis is often nonspecific (ie, <em>recent nonspecific viral infection</em>) — and the nature of chest pain may be variable. As a result — <em>other</em> causes of chest pain may be confused with the diagnosis. The other major <em><strong>purpose</strong></em> of <strong><em>physical</em> examination</strong> is therefore to <em><strong>rule out</strong></em> some of these <em><strong>other</strong></em> pulmonary or musculoskeletal <strong>causes</strong> of chest pain.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>12.2 – ECG FINDINGS of <em>Acute</em> Pericarditis</strong></p><p>In clinical practice — the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis is most often made on the basis of ECG findings. <strong>ECG Changes</strong> are divided into <strong>4 stages</strong>. The easiest way to remember these <em>sequential</em> ECG findings is to conceptualize the 4 stages as follows (<strong>Figure 12.2-1</strong>):</p><ul><li><strong>Stage I</strong> — <em>Everything is UP</em>. That is — there is ST elevation in <em>almost</em> all leads (<em>except perhaps in the right-sided leads = leads III,aVR,V1</em>)<em>.</em></li><li><strong>Stage II</strong> — <em>Transition</em>. There may be <em>“pseudonormalization”</em> in this stage that temporally occurs <em>between</em> the diffuse ST elevation of Stage I and the diffuse T wave inversion to follow.</li><li><strong>Stage III</strong> — *Everything is DOWN. *That is — there is <em>diffuse</em> T wave inversion in virtually all leads.</li><li><strong>Stage IV</strong> — Normalization (<em>as the ECG changes of acute pericarditis eventually resolve</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.2-1:</strong> The <strong>4 <em>Sequential</em> Stages</strong> of Pericarditis. <strong>Stage I</strong> (<em>diffuse ST elevation</em>) — is the <em>only</em> one of the 4 stages that is <em><strong>diagnostic</strong></em> of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong>. The amount of time spent in each stage is variable. “Pseudonormalization” in <strong>Stage II</strong> — explains why even <em>relatively</em> new-onset pericarditis may sometimes manifest minimal ECG changes (<em>or no ECG changes at all</em>). The <strong>Stage III</strong> phase (<em>diffuse T wave inversion</em>) — is <em>nonspecific</em> and may be impossible to distinguish from ischemia. Ultimately, ECG changes resolve (<strong>Stage IV</strong>) — though this may take weeks or months. <strong>PEARL:</strong> To remember the 4 stages — Think <em>everything</em> UP (<em>1st Stage</em>) — transition (<em>2nd Stage</em>) — <em>everything</em> DOWN (<em>3rd Stage</em>) — Resolution (<em>4th Stage</em>).</p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Points <em>regarding</em> Figure 12.2-1:</strong> The <em>amount</em> of <strong>time</strong> for <em><strong>evolution</strong></em> through the <strong>4 ECG stages</strong> of acute pericarditis is **<em>highly <em>variable</em></em> (<em>it may take hours <em>—</em> to days <em>—</em> to weeks or more</em>).</p><ul><li><em>Practically</em> speaking — the <em>only</em> ECG stage that is <em>diagnostic</em> is <strong>Stage I</strong>. This means that IF Stage I has <em>already</em> passed — it will *no longer be possible *to diagnose pericarditis by ECG (<em>because the ECG may almost look “normal” in Stage II <em>— and</em> in Stage III it shows diffuse T wave inversion that may be indistinguishable from ischemia</em>).</li><li><em>Awareness</em> of the above <em>expected</em> sequence of changes explains why the ECG may look relatively “normal” at an <em>early</em> stage in the process (ie, <em>during transitional Stage II in which ST segments return to baseline before going on to evolve into diffuse T wave inversion</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> Notes:</strong> <em>Additional</em> lab tests (<em>including Echo</em>) will often be ordered on patients with <em>suspected</em> pericarditis. That said — it is <em>rare</em> that these other tests will be “the test” that makes the diagnosis.</p><ul><li><strong>Echo</strong> is <strong><em>usually</em> normal</strong> — because the inflamed but nevertheless <em>thin</em> pericardial lining is <em>not</em> picked up by simple Echo <em>unless</em> an associated <em>significant</em> pericardial effusion is present (<em>Section 12.0</em>). Pericardial effusion is <em>absent</em> in many (<em>if not most</em>) cases of acute <em>viral</em> pericarditis that occurs in otherwise healthy subjects <em>without</em> other underlying systemic disease.</li><li>The diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis can be *easy *IF — a <strong><em>pericardial</em> friction rub</strong> is heard. But IF no rub is heard (<em>as is often the case</em>) — then <strong>diagnosis</strong> must be ***presumptive ***(<em>based on history and ECG findings</em>). Fortunately — a <em>presumptive</em> approach is reasonable given the generally *benign <em>and</em> self-limiting *course of most cases of <em>acute</em> viral (<em>idiopathic</em>) pericarditis that occur in otherwise healthy individuals.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>12.3 – Stage I of <em>Acute</em> Pericarditis</strong></p><p>Given that <strong>ECG diagnosis</strong> of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> can really <em>only</em> be <em><strong>made</strong></em> in <strong>Stage I</strong> — We focus on recognizing ECG findings in this stage (<strong>Figure 12.3-1</strong>):</p><ul><li>There will <em>often</em> be <strong><em>sinus</em> tachycardia</strong>. While sinus tachycardia is a <em>nonspecific</em> finding that is <em>not</em> essential for diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis — the <em>absence</em> of at least a <em>relatively</em> rapid heart rate is a factor <em>against</em> the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis.</li><li>There is <strong><em>diffuse</em> ST segment elevation</strong> (<em>Stage I is the “everything UP” stage</em>). This generalized ST elevation is thought to reflect a diffuse <em>subepicardial</em> injury current. The only leads that do <em>not</em> consistently show ST elevation are one or more of the <em>right-sided</em> leads (<em>III, aVR and V1</em>) that view the heart from a more distant perspective (<em>leads shaded in blue in</em> Figure 12.3-1).</li><li>The <em><strong>shape</strong></em> of <strong>ST elevation</strong> with acute pericarditis is often quite <em>similar</em> to that seen with early repolarization (<em><strong>concave up</strong></em>* = “smiley” configuration, sometimes with J-point notching*). It is almost as if the ST segment itself is normal and has been “lifted” above the baseline.</li><li>With <em>acute</em> pericarditis — the appearance of <strong>ST segments</strong> in <strong>leads I</strong> and <strong>II</strong> tends to look <em><strong>similar</strong></em>. This differs from the usual situation with acute <em>inferior</em> MI — in which lead III is much more likely to resemble lead II.</li><li>There is <strong>no <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong>! This is a key distinguishing feature of acute pericarditis from <em>acute</em> MI.</li><li><em>Infarction</em> Q waves are absent (<em>No more than small q waves are seen</em>).</li><li>**PR segment *depression ***is often noted in <strong><em>several</em> leads</strong> (*seen in <em>Figure 12.3-1</em> in leads I,II and V2,V3 *— <em>but not in leads aVL,aVF; V4,V5,V6</em>). PR depression is thought to reflect an atrial injury current. As was the case with atrial infarction (<em>Section 09.35</em>) — look to <strong>lead aVR</strong> for <strong><em>reciprocal</em> PR elevation</strong> (<em>which is present in</em> Figure 12.3-1).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.3-1:</strong> ECG Findings in <strong>Stage I <em>Acute</em> Pericarditis</strong>. The most characteristic finding is <strong><em>diffuse</em> ST elevation</strong> in all but one or more of the <em>“right-sided”</em> leads (<em>leads III,aVR,V1</em>). ST elevation is generally concave up (<em>“smiley”-shape</em>) — although <em>coved</em> ST elevation is seen here in leads V2,V3. As commonly occurs with early repolarization — there may be J-point notching in one or more leads (<em>seen here in leads I,V6</em>). Lead I often resembles lead II (<em>rather than lead III, as would occur with acute inferior MI</em>). There is <em>no</em> reciprocal ST depression. Finally, <strong>PR depression</strong> is often seen in at least several leads (<em>here in leads I,II and V2,V3</em>) — with PR elevation in lead aVR.</p><p><strong>12.4 – PR Depression: <em>How Helpful a Sign is this?</em></strong></p><p>Normally — the <strong>PR segment</strong> is <em>isoelectric</em> with respect to the ST segment baseline (<strong>Panel A</strong> <em>in</em> Figure 12.4-1). It is from this PR segment baseline that we generally judge ST segment deviations (<em>elevation</em> or <em>depression</em>) — assuming baseline wander is minimal and that the heart rate is not so fast as to preclude identification of the PR segment (<em>Section 09.15</em>).</p><ul><li>With generalized inflammation of the pericardial lining — <em><strong>depression</strong></em> of the <strong>PR segment</strong> <em>below</em> the ST baseline will often be seen in <em>at least</em> several leads. Recognition of <strong>PR depression</strong> should be evident in <strong>Figure 12.4-1</strong> by comparing the PR segment in <strong>Panel B</strong> (<em>relative to its dotted ST segment baseline</em>) — with the normal (<em>isoelectric</em>) PR segment seen in Panel A.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.4-1:</strong> Comparison of a <em>normal</em> PR segment (<strong>Panel A</strong>) — with PR depression seen in <strong>Panel B</strong>, in which the PR segment descends <em>below</em> the ST baseline (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong><em>Clinical</em> CAVEATS:</strong> PR depression is often subtle. As a result — this finding is subject to <em>inter- <em>and</em> intra-observer</em> variability.</p><ul><li>PR depression is <em>not</em> always seen with <em>acute</em> pericarditis.</li><li>PR depression may occasionally be seen in <em>other</em> conditions. These include:** i)** normal repolarization variants; <strong>ii)</strong> patients with acute MI (<em>and/or with atrial infarction</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> with tachycardia (<em>the PR shortens with tachycardia, which makes PR assessment more challenging at faster heart rates</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> <em>Be aware</em> of the term <strong>PR depression</strong> — as this will often come up in <em>diagnostic</em> discussion about possible <em>acute</em> pericarditis. Definite identification of PR depression in <em>several</em> leads is possible — and is diagnostically useful (<strong>Figure 12.4-2</strong>). Support that the finding of PR depression is <em>real</em> and meaningful may be derived by the finding of <strong>PR <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong>. That said — Be aware that <em>both</em> false <em>positive</em> and false <em>negative</em> diagnosis of acute pericarditis is frequently associated with the phenomenon of seeing PR depression.</p><ul><li><strong>Therefore</strong> — It is probably best <em>not</em> to base your diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis on whether or not you see PR depression.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.4-2:</strong> <em>Schematic</em> tracing illustrating ECG findings of <em>acute</em> pericarditis (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 12.3-1). In addition to seeing <em>diffuse</em> ST elevation in the <em>absence</em> of reciprocal ST depression — <strong>PR <em>depression</em></strong> is seen in several leads (<em>red arrows</em>). Support that this finding of PR depression is real — is forthcoming from the finding of <strong>PR <em>elevation</em></strong> in <strong>lead aVR</strong> (<em>blue arrow</em>). While not enough by itself to make the diagnosis of acute pericarditis — PR depression (<em>in association with PR elevation in lead aVR</em>) is clearly supportive of the diagnosis (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>12.5 – What is <em>Spodick’s</em> Sign?</strong></p><p>An additional ECG diagnostic sign that is often mentioned with discussion of <em>acute</em> pericarditis — is <strong><em>Spodick’s</em> sign</strong> (<em>named after Dr. David Spodick who is internationally known for his work on pericarditis</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Spodick’s</em> Sign</strong> — is a <em><strong>downsloping</strong></em> of the <strong>TP</strong> (<em>or entire QRS-TP</em>) <strong>segment</strong> that may be present in a number of leads with <em>acute</em> pericarditis (*downward slanting red dotted line in *<strong>Figure 12.5-1</strong>). When seen in at least a few leads in association with a <em>suggestive</em> clinical history and <em>other</em> typical ECG findings — this sign further supports the diagnosis of <em>acute</em> pericarditis.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.5-1:</strong> Spodick’s sign — defined as a <em>downsloping</em> of the TP (<em>or entire QRS-TP</em>) segment (<em>red dotted line</em>). <strong><em>Clinical</em> Caveat</strong> — In our experience, determination of whether or not <strong><em>Spodick’s</em> sign</strong> is present is often <em>subjective</em> and <em>suboptimally</em> reproducible. While we regularly look for this sign when contemplating the diagnosis of acute pericarditis — We caution <em>against</em> depending on presence or absence of Spodick’s sign as your sole criterion for diagnosing acute pericarditis (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><em><em>12.6 –</em> Differential</em> Diagnosis: <em>Acute</em> MI vs <em>Early</em> Repolarization?**</p><p><em>Distinction</em> between Stage 1 pericarditis and early repolarization or acute MI can <em>usually</em> be made because:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Early</em> Repolarization</strong> — is most often seen in otherwise <em>healthy</em> young adults. ST elevation is usually <em><strong>localized</strong></em> to one (<em>at most two</em>) areas of the heart — vs <strong>more <em>diffuse</em> ST elevation</strong> with <em><strong>pericarditis</strong></em>. Be aware that the <em>shape</em> of ST segment elevation may be similar with both conditions (<em>“smiley” configuration</em>) — and J-point notching may be seen in both conditions.</li><li><strong><em>Acute</em> MI</strong> — is usually suggested by the history (<em>older patient with risk factors; chest pain is more constant and severe <em>— and</em> chest pain is less likely to be pleuritic or positional</em>). The ECG may show <strong>Q waves</strong> — and Q waves may <em>increase</em> in size as the infarct evolves. There will usually be at least some <strong><em>reciprocal</em> ST depression</strong> during the course of <em>acute</em> MI — whereas <em>neither</em> pericarditis <em>nor</em> early repolarization manifest <em>reciprocal</em> changes.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>PEARL:</strong> A distinguishing feature between acute MI and pericarditis — is that with <em>acute</em> MI, T wave inversion will often be seen <em>while</em> the ST segment is <em>still</em> elevated (<strong>Figure 12.6-1</strong>). In contrast, with <em>acute</em> pericarditis — ST segments are first diffusely elevated (<em>1st Stage</em>) — then ST segments return to baseline (<em>2nd Stage</em>) — and <em>only then</em> is there T wave inversion (<em>3rd Stage</em>). Thus, the picture in <em>schematic</em> Figure 12.6-1 is strongly suggestive of <strong><em>acute</em> MI</strong> rather than pericarditis because the T wave is inverted <em>while</em> the ST segment is still elevated.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Final</em> Point:</strong> As previously noted (<em>in Section 12.3</em>) — ST segments in leads I and II tend to look similar with <em>acute</em> pericarditis. This is in contrast to what is usually seen with acute <em>inferior</em> MI — in which case lead III is much more likely to resemble lead II in appearance.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.6-1:</strong> With **<em>acute <em>Pericarditis</em></em> — the T wave typically does <em>not</em> invert until <em>after</em> the ST segment has returned to baseline (<em>Section 12.2</em>). In contrast, with <strong><em>acute</em> MI</strong> (<em>as seen here</em>) — the T wave may invert <em>while</em> the ST segment is <em>still</em> elevated.</p><p><em><em>12.7 –</em> Acute</em> Myocarditis/Endocarditis: <em>ECG Changes?</em>**</p><p>The causes and symptoms of <strong><em>acute</em> Myocarditis</strong> and <strong>Endocarditis</strong> are <em>many</em> and extend <em>beyond</em> the scope of this ECG PB book. Our purpose in this brief subsection is merely to increase awareness of the ECG abnormalities that <em>may</em> be seen. The <strong>ECG picture</strong> is <strong><em>not</em> predictable</strong> with either <em><strong>myocarditis</strong></em> or <em><strong>endocarditis</strong></em>. It may include:</p><ul><li><em>Various</em> forms of SA and AV nodal block (<em>from 1st degree — up to 3rd degree AV block with long pauses</em>).</li><li><em>Conduction</em> system defects (<em>BBB, hemiblocks, IVCD</em>).</li><li>Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias (<em>including VT/VFib</em>).</li><li>The <em>gamut</em> of ST-T wave abnormalities (<em>ST elevation/depression; T wave inversion; nonspecific ST changes</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> ECG findings with myocarditis and endocarditis are highly variable and nonspecific.

As previously noted *— *We caution <em>against</em> dependence on this sign when its presence is questionable because of subjectivity in its interpretation.</li><li><strong>Finally</strong> *— *The likelihood of <em>acute</em> MI is low. This is because: <strong>i)</strong> ST elevation is diffuse and manifests an upward concavity with J-Point notching; and <strong>ii)</strong> There is <em>no</em> reciprocal ST depression. In contrast *— *the ST elevation of <em>acute</em> MI is typically coved; localized to one (<em>or at most 2</em>) lead areas; not notched; and associated with <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression. The patient’s relatively <em>younger</em> age and <em>atypical</em> symptoms in this case are also <em>against</em> acute MI. This patient <em>did</em> have <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong>.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>12.9 – FIGURE 12.9-1: <em>Pericarditis or Early Repolarization?</em></strong></p><p>We conclude this segment on <em>acute</em> pericarditis by revisiting the ECG shown in Figure 12.9-1 — which we <em>initially</em> encountered in Section 09.19 when discussing early repolarization.</p><ul><li>How would you interpret this tracing IF told that it was obtained from an otherwise <em>healthy</em> young adult?</li><li>Would your interpretation <em>change</em> — IF told that this young adult had a <em>recent</em> upper respiratory infection and was complaining of <em>pleuritic-type</em> chest pain?</li><li><em>Despite</em> ST elevation in <em>several</em> leads — Why is the ECG shown in Figure 12.9-1 <em>not</em> suggestive of an <em>acute</em> MI?</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 12.9-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a young adult (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 09.19-1).

(<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 12.9-1:</strong> As emphasized in Section 09.19 — our <em>descriptive</em> analysis for ECG findings on this 12-lead tracing does <em>not</em> change regardless of the history. Only the <em>relative</em> probabilities for our clinical impression will change depending on the clinical scenario.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Descriptive</em> Analysis:</strong> There is sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis. Voltage for LVH would <em>not</em> be present if the patient was younger (<em>less than 35 years of age</em>). Transition is normal (<em>occurs between lead V3-to-V4</em>).</li><li>A Q wave with T wave inversion is seen in lead III. Small, narrow q waves are seen in V5,V6. Taken in isolation — <em>none</em> of these findings are necessarily abnormal.</li><li>Instead — the most remarkable finding on this ECG is <strong>ST elevation</strong> in <strong><em>multiple</em> leads</strong>. This ST elevation manifests an <em>upward</em> concavity (<em>“smiley”-configuration</em>) in most leads in which it is seen — although the ST segment is <em>coved</em> in lead V2, and the ST segment takeoff is <em>straightened</em> in lead V3.</li><li><strong>J-point <em>notching</em></strong> is seen in <em>several</em> leads. This is most notable in leads V5,V6 — but <em>also</em> present in leads I,II,aVF and V4. The <em>shape</em> of this J-point notching is characteristic of early repolarization.</li><li><em>Infarction</em> Q waves are absent. That is — the q waves in leads V5,V6 are small and narrow, with the appearance of being normal <em>septal</em> q waves. The Q wave in lead III is deeper — but as an <em>isolated</em> finding, this is <em>not</em> necessarily abnormal (<em>Section 09.12</em>).</li><li>There is <em>no</em> reciprocal ST depression (<em>isolated T wave inversion in lead III does not qualify in this case as “reciprocal” ST depression</em>).</li><li>We do <em>not</em> appreciate PR depression.</li><li>Lead II seems to resemble lead I more than lead III.</li><li>We can easily <em>“talk ourself into”</em> a positive Spodick sign for the sloping TP segment in leads V4,V5,V6.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Putting <em>Together</em> ECG Findings in Figure 12.9-1:</strong> Our reason for presenting this ECG again (<em>reproduced from</em> Figure 09.19-1) — is to emphasize: <strong>i)</strong> How <em>challenging</em> it may sometimes be to assess the ECG of a patient with chest pain and ST elevation; and <strong>ii)</strong> How important the clinical scenario is in our interpretation.</p><ul><li>IF this patient was an <em><strong>asymptomatic</strong></em> otherwise healthy** young adult** — We would <em>not</em> hesitate calling this <strong><em>Early</em> Repolarization</strong> (<em>concave up ST elevation in multiple leads; J-point notching; no infarction q waves and no reciprocal ST depression</em>).</li><li>On the other hand — IF this young adult had <strong><em>pleuritic</em> chest pain</strong> with a <strong><em>recent</em> URI</strong> — We would have to be concerned about the <em>possibility</em> of <strong><em>acute</em> pericarditis</strong> (<em>diffuse ST elevation and lack of reciprocal ST depression in the setting of a history consistent with acute pericarditis</em>). Although the <em>slow</em> heart rate and highly characteristic J-point notching seen here might lead us to question this diagnosis — in the absence of a prior tracing to document longstanding early repolarization, it would be difficult to exclude acute pericarditis.</li><li>Finally — IF this patient was <em><strong>older</strong></em> with <strong><em>new-onset</em> chest discomfort</strong> — All bets would be off (<em>especially in the absence of a prior ECG for comparison</em>)! Although the ECG in Figure 12.9-1 does <em>not</em> show infarction Q waves, <em>reciprocal</em> ST depression, or ST coving more suggestive of acute injury — the onus of proof when the history is concerning falls on us to <em>rule out</em> the possibility of early acute MI (<em>rather than having to rule it in</em>). At the least, we would start by <em>repeating</em> the ECG in short order to see if any evolution occurs. Whether or not to admit this patient (<em>and/or to consider acute investigation</em>) — would depend on a series of factors as discussed in detail in Section 10.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> An ECG such as that seen in Figure 12.9-1 — could be <em>consistent</em> with <em>acute</em> pericarditis or even early <em>acute</em> injury — IF clinical features suggesting either diagnosis were present. As relevant to Section 12 — Assessing the patient with chest pain for the possibility of <em>acute</em> pericarditis is often a <em>challenging</em> task that entails far <em>more</em> than simply looking at the patient’s ECG.</p><ul><li><strong>P.S.</strong> — It turned out in this case that the ST segment elevation seen in <em>multiple</em> leads in Figure 12.9-1 was a <strong>normal <em>repolarization</em> variant</strong> (<em>and not due to acute coronary syndrome or pericarditis</em>).</li><li><strong>PEARL:</strong> Making this patient a <strong><em>miniaturized</em> copy</strong> of his <strong>ECG</strong> that he can carry in his wallet may be a prudent way to <em>avoid</em> unnecessary hospital admission in the event chest discomfort is experienced in the future.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>13.0 – <em>Computerized</em> ECG Interpretations</strong></p><p>A frequent question that arises is, “How best to use (<em>or not use</em>) the <strong><em>computerized</em> ECG interpretation</strong>?” <em>Opinions vary</em>. We feel the answer depends on the goals and <em>experience</em> level of the interpreter.</p><ul><li><em>Computerized</em> ECG analysis systems are <strong><em>not</em> infallible</strong>. Although they clearly have merit in certain regards — they are far from perfect at ECG interpretation. Our task is to <em>appreciate the positives</em> of computer systems <em>while</em> being aware of their drawbacks.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>13.1 – <em>Computerized</em> Systems: <em>Pros & Cons</em></strong></p><p>At the current time — virtually <em>all</em> modern ECG machines <em>automatically</em> provide a <strong><em>computerized</em> interpretation.</strong> This has <em>benefits</em> and <em>drawbacks</em>. Consider the following:</p><ul><li><em>Computerized</em> systems <em><strong>excel</strong></em> at computing <strong>values</strong>. This is because <em>that’s what computers do</em>. As a result — <em>computerized</em> systems are <strong><em>extremely</em> accurate</strong> in calculating: <strong>i)</strong> Rate; <strong>ii)</strong> Intervals (<em>PR/QRS/QT intervals</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> Axis.</li><li><em>Computerized</em> systems are <em>usually</em> reliable in recognizing <strong><em>sinus</em> rhythm</strong> mechanisms and <strong><em>normal</em> tracings</strong>.</li><li>For the <strong><em>Expert</em> Interpreter</strong> — the <em>best</em> feature of <em>computerized</em> systems is that they <strong><em>save</em> time</strong>! There is <em>no longer need</em> to calculate rate, intervals or axis — since the computer <em>instantly</em> provides legible and <em>accurate</em> print-out of these values. IF the computer says, <em>“Normal ECG”</em> — it may literally take <em>no more</em> than 2-3 seconds for an <em>experienced</em> interpreter to peruse the tracing and <em>sign</em> the report (<em>provided there is agreement with the computer interpretation</em>).</li><li>For the **<em>Non-Expert <em>Interpreter</em></em> — the major benefit of <em>computerized</em> systems is the <strong><em>backup</em> opinion</strong> the system provides. The computer may suggest findings <em>not</em> initially thought of by a <em>less</em> experienced interpreter. This encourages more careful, targeted review of the tracing. It may also be <em>educational</em> by the suggestions it makes. Finally — confidence is boosted when computer analysis agrees with the clinician’s interpretation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The computer backup opinion <strong>may <em>also</em> help</strong> the <em><strong>expert-in-a-hurry</strong></em> by <em>reducing</em> the chance that any ECG findings will be overlooked.</p><ul><li>Interpretation of any <em>one</em> ECG by an expert provided with: <strong>i)</strong> a moment of time; and <strong>ii)</strong> the clinical history — will <em>always</em> be superior to interpretation by a machine. That said — this is <em>not</em> reality.</li><li>Reality in the “real world” — is that the clinician assigned to interpret <em>all</em> tracings on a given hospital or ambulatory service usually has <em>limited</em> time to interpret a <em>large</em> number of ECGs and is often asked to do so <em>without</em> the benefit of clinical history. As a result — it becomes <em>easy</em> for even an expert interpreter to <em>overlook</em> certain findings on occasional tracings. <strong>Knowing <em>how</em> to use</strong> the <em>computerized</em> interpretation as a <em><strong>“backup opinion”</strong></em> can be invaluable even for the most experienced of interpreters! (<em>Grauer, Nelson, Marriott et al: J Am Bd Fam Prac 1:17-24, 1989</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>CAVEATS (<em>What the Computer May Miss</em>):</strong> <em>Computerized</em> systems do <em>not</em> do nearly as well in evaluation of abnormal tracings as they do in assessing ECGs with minimal abnormalities. The more complex the abnormal ECG is — the more difficult it becomes for a <em>computerized</em> system to render an entirely accurate interpretation.</p><ul><li><em>Computerized</em> systems are far less accurate interpreting rhythms that do <em>not</em> have a sinus mechanism.</li><li>They may miss <em>subtle</em> infarctions.</li><li>They tend to <em>overinterpret</em> the J-point ST elevation that is commonly seen with early repolarization patterns. As a result — <em>computerized</em> systems may be prone to mislabel these normal variants as “acute MI”.</li><li><em>Computerized</em> systems may <em>miss</em> pacemaker spikes/WPW/<em>tall</em> R in V1. They are <em>unlikely</em> to appreciate certain clinical entities such as Wellens’ syndrome or DeWinter T waves.</li><li>Many hospitals do not utilize <em>special</em> computer programs for interpretation of ECGs obtained on <em>pediatric</em> patients. Obvious problems with interpretation will arise IF a <em>pediatric</em> ECG is interpreted by a computer program using <em>adult</em> criteria.</li><li>Finally — *computerized *systems by definition lack the <em>“human Gestalt”</em> by an expert of the overall tracing.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>13.2 – <em>Suggested</em> Approach: <em>How to Use the Computer</em></strong></p><p>The <em>most</em> important point to emphasize in this Section — is that clinical use of the <em>computerized</em> report by <em>non-expert</em> interpreters should be <em>very different</em> than use of this same report by the <em>expert</em> who regularly interprets a large volume of tracings. <strong><em>Expertise</em> of the interpreter</strong> therefore **<em>dictates</em> the approach we recommend **(<em>Grauer: Practical Guide to ECG Interpretation; Mosby, St. Louis; pp 375-379, 1998</em>).</p><ul><li>For the **<em>Non-Expert <em>Interpreter</em></em> — Do <em>not</em> initially read the computer report. Instead — <em>WRITE</em> OUT (<em>or at least think out</em>) your interpretation first. Only <em>after</em> independently making your own interpretation — should you look at the computerized report. At this point — Check <em>each</em> of the findings you note with <em>each</em> computer statement. Then delete, modify <em>and/or</em> add to the computer interpretation as needed.</li><li>For the **<em>Expert <em>Interpreter</em></em> — Review the computer report <em>either</em> before or after evaluation of the ECG itself. <em>Minimize</em> time devoted to determination of heart rate, intervals and axis (<em>since the computer is very accurate for these parameters</em>). Consider more careful evaluation IF the rhythm is <em>not</em> sinus — or IF the ECG is interpreted by the computer as abnormal. Overread <em>each</em> computer statement. Place a <strong><em>check</em> mark</strong> next to those that are accurate. Delete, modify or add to incorrect statements.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>KEY</em> Point:</strong> The <strong><em>expert</em> interpreter</strong> is <em>not</em> using the <em>computerized</em> report to “learn”. This is because by definition — the interpretation of an <strong><em>expert</em> electrocardiographer</strong> is the <strong>“gold standard”</strong>. Since computerized systems are programmed by experts — the <em>best</em> they can realistically hope for is to put out interpretations that <em>equal</em> the level of accuracy of the expert that programmed them.</p><ul><li>The <em><strong>expert</strong></em> uses the computer: <strong>i)</strong> to save time; and <strong>ii)</strong> to prevent overlooking findings when forced to read <em>many</em> ECGs in a <em>limited</em> period of time.</li><li><strong><em>Less experienced</em> interpreters</strong> do look to the computer to assist in accuracy. They are usually called on to read <em>no more</em> than one ECG at any one time. Therefore — the <em>most</em> important step for the <em><strong>non-expert</strong></em> is to first <em>COVER UP</em> the computerized report. It is otherwise all too easy to be biased by what the computer says. Used in this way — comparing one’s <em>own</em> interpretation with what the computer says <em>optimally</em> incorporates potential benefit from any discrepancy in interpretation that may exist.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>13.3 – FIGURE 13.3-1: <em>Do You Agree with the Computer?</em></strong></p><p>Perhaps the <em>best</em> way to illustrate potential pros and cons of <em>computerized</em> interpretations — is by clinical example. Consider the ECG shown in <strong>Figure 13.3-1</strong> — obtained from a 78 year old woman with <em>atypical</em> chest pain.</p><ul><li>The <strong><em>computerized</em> interpretation</strong> was: Sinus rhythm; left axis (<em>-10 degrees</em>) — but otherwise “normal” ECG.</li><li><em>Do you agree</em> with the <em>computerized</em> interpretation?</li><li><strong>HINT:</strong> Be sure to interpret this ECG <em>in its entirety</em> by the systematic approach first — <em>before</em> you compare what the computer said with your interpretation.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 13.3-1:</strong> ECG obtained from a 78 year old woman with <em>atypical</em> chest pain. The <strong>computerized report</strong> interpreted this tracing as, “left axis but otherwise normal”. <em>Do you agree</em> with the <em>computerized</em> report?</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 13.3-1:</strong> The rhythm is sinus. All intervals are normal. The axis is leftward (<em>predominantly negative QRS in lead aVF</em>) *— *but <em>not</em> negative enough to qualify as LAHB (<em>since the QRS in lead II is still upright</em>). No chamber enlargement.</p><ul><li>Regarding <strong>Q-R-S-T Changes</strong> — There are <strong>QS complexes</strong> in leads V1,V2. An r wave develops by lead V3 — and transition occurs normally between lead V3-to-V4. Although there is <em>no more</em> than minimal (<em>at most</em>) ST elevation — <strong>T waves</strong> are <strong><em>dramatically</em> peaked</strong> in <em>anterior</em> precordial leads (<em>especially in lead V2</em>). There is shallow T inversion in lead III, and perhaps some <em>nonspecific</em> ST-T wave flattening in lead aVF.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>IMPRESSION:</strong> This example highlights the importance of <em>overreading</em> the <em>computer</em>ized interpretation after you have <em>independently</em> arrived at your own conclusion. This is <em>not</em> a “normal” ECG. That statement should be <em><strong>crossed out</strong></em> on the computerized report. This is because the <em>computerized</em> interpretation is a medical record — and statements you disagree with should therefore be crossed out.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> correlation</strong> is needed to determine the meaning of the <em>abnormal</em> findings you identified. <strong>Of Concern</strong> — is the fact that <strong>i)</strong> this woman is of a “certain age” (<em>78 years old — so clearly old enough to have coronary disease</em>); — and <strong>ii)</strong> she is having “chest pain” (<em>even though it is described as “atypical” in nature</em>).</li><li>While <em>not</em> definitive — the <strong>QS complexes</strong> in leads <strong>V1,V2</strong> could reflect <em>septal</em> infarction of <em>uncertain</em> age. This should <em>at least</em> be noted in your interpretation (<em>it was ignored by the computerized report</em>).</li><li>There is <strong><em>marked</em> T wave peaking</strong> — especially in** leads V2,V3**. This is <em>not</em> normal (<em>despite also being ignored by the computerized report</em>). Possible explanations for this <em>abnormal</em> T wave peaking include: <strong>i)</strong> Hyperkalemia (<em>less likely because T wave peaking is not generalized <em>and</em> the base of these T waves is not narrow — <em>but</em> a serum K+ level should nevertheless be checked to rule this out</em>); <strong>ii)</strong> Ischemia (<em>which when posterior in location sometimes manifests as anterior T wave peaking</em>); and <strong>iii)</strong> DeWinter T waves. Given the history of chest discomfort — we are <em>most</em> concerned with this 3rd possibility. While the J-point ST depression that is usually seen with **<em>DeWinter <em>T waves</em></em> is <em>missing</em> in Figure 13.3-1 — the ECG picture in this tracing is otherwise perfectly compatible with this harbinger sign of possible impending <em>proximal</em> LAD occlusion (<em>Section 10.58</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> It might be easy to <em>overlook</em> the QS complexes in leads V1,V2 of this tracing IF you allowed the computerized report to <em>bias</em> you prior to rendering <em>your own</em> independent interpretation. Hopefully — you did <em>not</em> overlook the obviously abnormal T wave peaking in anterior leads that somehow escaped detection by the computer. Recognition of <strong><em>DeWinter</em> T waves</strong> is indication for <em>immediate</em> cath/acute reperfusion — so this possibility mandates <em>immediate</em> attention. This would have been <em>missed</em> had the computer report been accepted without overread. <em>Computerized</em> interpretations can be extremely helpful to <em>both</em> expert and <em>non-expert</em> interpreters — but knowing <em>HOW</em> to use the computer report always assumes <em>first</em> priority.</p><p><strong>14.0 – Electrical Alternans</strong></p><p>We conclude this ECG-2014-ePub with brief comment on the fascinating phenomenon of <strong><em>electrical</em> alternans</strong>. This relatively uncommon clinical entity is frequently misunderstood — and <em>often</em> overlooked when it does occur. Electrical alternans is a general term that encompasses a number of <em>different</em> pathophysiologic mechanisms. Its occurrence is <em>not</em> limited to pericardial tamponade — but instead has been associated with an expanding array of clinical conditions.</p><ul><li>Distinction should be made between <em>electrical</em> and <em>mechanical</em> alternans. The term <em><strong>“alternans”</strong></em> itself — merely indicates that there is <strong><em>phasic</em> fluctuation</strong> in <strong><em>some</em> cardiac signal</strong> from one beat to the next within the cardiac cycle. This may be in the strength of the pulse (<em>or the blood pressure recorded</em>) — or it may be in one or more waveforms in the ECG recording.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Discussion is <em>limited</em> in this Section 14 to ECG manifestations of alternans. Nevertheless — it may be helpful to first define <em>other</em> alternans phenomena that may sometimes be confused with the various ECG manifestations (<em>especially since these other forms of alternans phenomena may also be seen with cardiac tamponade</em>).</p><ul><li><strong><em>Pulsus</em> alternans</strong> — is a <em>mechanical</em> form of alternans. The rhythm is <em>regular</em> — but cardiac output varies from beat-to-beat. It is seen with severe systolic dysfunction. Pulsus alternans should be distinguished from a <strong><em>bigeminal</em> pulse</strong> — in which a <em>weaker</em> beat follows the stronger beat by a <em>shorter</em> time interval (<em>as occurs when the alternating beat is a PVC, which understandably generates less cardiac output</em>).</li><li>Pulsus alternans should also be distinguished from <strong><em>pulsus</em> paradoxus</strong> — in which there is a palpable decrease in pulse amplitude (<em>or a measured drop of >10mm in blood pressure</em>) during quiet inspiration. While pulsus <em>alternans</em> and <em>paradoxus</em> may both be seen with pericardial tamponade — they are <em>different</em> phenomena than the various types of <em>electrical</em> alternans.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>14.1 – Electrical Alternans: <em>Definition/Features/Mechanisms</em></strong></p><p>Electrical alternans — is a <em>beat-to-beat</em> variation in any one or more parts of the ECG recording. It may occur with <em>every-other-beat</em> — or with some other recurring ratio (<em>3:1; 4:1; etc.</em>). Amplitude or direction of the P wave, QRS complex, ST segment <em>and/or</em> T wave may all be affected (<em>although P wave alternans is rare</em>). Alternating interval duration (<em>of PR, QRS or QT intervals</em>) may also be seen.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Electrical</em> alternans</strong> — was first observed in the laboratory by Herring in 1909. It was reported clinically by Sir Thomas Lewis a year later, who characterized the phenomena as occurring, <em>“either when the heart muscle is normal but the heart rate is very fast</em> or <em>when there is serious heart disease and the rate is normal”</em>. This 1910 description by Lewis serves well to this day to remind us of the 2 principal clinical situations in which electrical alternans is most often encountered: <strong>i)</strong> Supraventricular <em>reentry</em> tachycardias; and <strong>ii)</strong> Pericardial tamponade.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Mechanisms:</strong> There are 3 basic types of electrical alternans phenomena — each relating to a different pathophysiologic mechanism: <strong>i)</strong> <em>Repolarization</em> alternans; <strong>ii)</strong> <em>Conduction</em> and <em>Refractoriness</em> alternans; and <strong>iii)</strong> Alternans due to abnormal cardiac motion. A common cellular mechanism may underlie each of these processes relating to abnormal calcium release or reuptake within the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p><ul><li><strong><em>Repolarization</em> alternans</strong> — entails <em>beat-to-beat</em> variation in the <strong>ST segment</strong> <em>and/or</em> <strong>T wave</strong>. Alternation in ST segment appearance (<em>or in the amount of ST elevation or depression</em>) — is often linked to ischemia. In contrast — T wave alternation is more often associated with changes in heart rate or in QT duration (<em>especially when the QT is prolonged</em>). In patients with a long QT — T wave alternans may forebode impending Torsades de Pointes. Both ST segment and T wave alternans have been known to precede malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, this type of electrical alternans may convey important adverse prognostic implications when seen in certain situations. That said — a <em>variety</em> of clinical conditions have been associated with <strong><em>repolarization</em> alternans</strong>, such that adverse prognostic implications do not always follow. Among these clinical conditions are congenital long QT syndrome — severe electrolyte disturbance (<em>hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; hypomagnesemia</em>) — alcoholic or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — acute pulmonary embolus — subarachnoid hemorrhage — cardiac arrest and the post-resuscitation period — and various forms of ischemia (<em>spontaneous or induced by treadmill testing or other stimulus</em>).</li><li><strong><em>Conduction <em><strong>and</strong></em> Refractoriness</em> alternans</strong> — entails variance of impulse propagation along <em>some</em> part of the conduction system. This may result from fluctuations in heart rate or in nervous system activity or from pharmacologic treatment. ECG manifestations from this form of alternans may include <strong><em>alternating</em> appearance</strong> of the <strong>P wave</strong>, <strong>QRS complex</strong> or alternating difference in <strong>P-R</strong> or** R-R interval duration**. In particular — QRS alternans during <em>narrow</em> SVT rhythms has been associated with <strong><em>reentry</em> tachycardias</strong>. While identification of <strong>QRS alternans</strong> during a <em>regular</em> SVT often indicates <em>retrograde</em> conduction over an AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>) — this phenomenon has also been seen in patients with simple PSVT/AVNRT that exclusively limits its reentry pathway to the AV Node. Therefore — identification of QRS alternans during a <em>regular</em> SVT does <em>not</em> prove the existence of an accessory pathway. <em>Conduction</em> and <em>refractoriness</em> alternans may be seen with <em>WPW-related</em> as well as <em>AV Nodal-dependent</em> reentry tachycardias — atrial fibrillation — acute pulmonary embolus — myocardial contusion — and severe LV dysfunction.</li><li><strong><em>Cardiac Motion</em> alternans</strong> — is the result of cardiac movement rather than electrical alternation. The most important clinical entity associated with <strong><em>motion</em> alternans</strong> is large pericardial effusion — though motion alternans has also been observed in some cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is important to appreciate that <em>not</em> all pericardial effusions produce electrical alternans. Development of <strong><em>total</em> electrical alternans</strong> (<em>of P wave, QRS complex and T wave</em>) — is likely to be a harbinger of <strong><em>impending</em> tamponade</strong>. Unfortunately — the sensitivity of <em>total</em> electrical alternans is poor for predicting tamponade (ie, <em>most patients who develop tamponade do not manifest preceding electrical alternans</em>). Therefore — it may be helpful if you see total electrical alternans in a patient with a large pericardial effusion — but failure to see this ECG sign <em>in no way</em> rules out the possibility that tamponade is occurring. Echo studies in patients with documented cardiac tamponade confirm that electrical alternans is synchronous with and a direct result of the <em>pendulous</em> movement of the heart within the enlarged, <em>fluid-filled</em> pericardial sac of a patient with large pericardial effusion (<em>See Section 14.4</em>).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>14.2 – Electrical Alternans: <em>KEY Clinical Points</em></strong></p><p>In summary, electrical alternans is <em>not</em> common — but it <em>does</em> occur. You <em>will</em> see it. You have probably <em>already</em> seen it a number of times <em>without</em> even realizing it. <strong><em>Electrical</em> alternans</strong> is a fascinating but <em>advanced</em> concept. It is clearly <em>beyond-the-core</em> for many who are using this ECG-2014-ePub — but we choose to include it because of its uniqueness and the clinical insights that this fascinating ECG sign may provide.</p><ul><li>In our experience — <strong><em>electrical</em> alternans</strong> is most often seen in association with <strong><em>regular</em> SVT rhythms</strong>. Seeing it in this context suggests (<em>but does not prove</em>) the existence of an AP (<em>Accessory Pathway</em>). Regardless of whether the mechanism of the <em>regular</em> SVT is AVNRT or AVRT — it is likely that <em><strong>reentry</strong></em> is involved. This conclusion may prove useful in contemplating potential investigative and therapeutic interventions.</li><li>In a patient with pericarditis — a large heart on chest X-ray — or simply unexplained dyspnea — recognition of electrical alternans should suggest the possibility of a significant <strong><em>pericardial</em> effusion</strong> that may be associated with tamponade. That said — electrical alternans is a <strong><em>nonspecific</em> ECG sign</strong> that may also indicate myocardial ischemia, LV dysfunction <em>and/or</em> possibility of any of a number of <em>other</em> precipitating factors. <strong><em>BOTTOM</em> Line:</strong> If you see electrical alternans — Look for an <em>underlying</em> clinical condition that may be responsible for this ECG sign.</li><li>Development of <strong><em>electrical</em> alternans</strong> per se — conveys <em>no</em> adverse prognostic implications <em>beyond those</em> associated with severity of the <em>underlying</em> disorder. Two exceptions to this general rule are: <strong>i)</strong> In a patient with QT prolongation or severe ischemia — recognition of electrical alternans may portend <em>deterioration</em> to Torsades or VT/VFib; and <strong>ii)</strong> In a patient with a large pericardial effusion — development of <strong><em>total</em> electrical alternans</strong> (<em>of P wave, QRS complex and T wave</em>) suggests there may now be tamponade.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>14.3 – FIGURE 14.3-1: <em>Alternans in an SVT Rhythm?</em></strong></p><p>Consider the 3-lead rhythm strip shown in Figure 14.3-1 — obtained from a patient in a <strong><em>regular</em> SVT rhythm</strong>.</p><ul><li>Is electrical alternans present?

In addition — there is both <strong><em>QRS</em> alternans</strong> (*red and blue double arrows in *Figure 14.3-1) — and **<em>T wave <em>alternans</em></em> (<em>red and blue circles</em>). That is — QRS morphology <em>changes</em> every-other-beat. This is subtle in lead V1 — but more noticeable in lead V2 where the initial R wave manifests an obvious difference in height from one beat to the next. Similarly — T wave morphology changes every-other beat, with this clearly more noticeable in lead V2 which manifests extra peaking of every-other-T wave (<em>red and blue circles in lead V2</em>).</p><ul><li>Clinical implications of these forms of electrical alternans in a patient with SVT — are that <em><strong>reentry</strong></em> is almost certain to be involved in the mechanism.

What is the <em>likely</em> cause of the <em>bigeminal</em> rhythm? (<em>See text</em>).</p><p><strong>Answer to Figure 14.4-1:</strong> There is obvious <strong><em>QRS</em> alternans</strong> — with marked variation in QRS amplitude from beat-to-beat. This is most dramatic in lead V3 — in which there is a 180 degree alternation in QRS direction from one beat to the next.</p><ul><li>The rhythm is <em>not</em> atrial or ventricular bigeminy — because P wave morphology is constant and the P-P interval is perfectly <em>regular</em> throughout the tracing. The PR interval remains the same. Therefore — the rhythm is sinus and the change in QRS morphology must be solely the result of <strong><em>electrical</em> alternans</strong>.</li><li>ST-T wave morphology does <em>not</em> appreciably change from beat-to-beat in any of the 12 leads on this tracing. Thus, alternans appears limited to a change in QRS morphology.</li><li><strong><em>Clinical</em> Note:</strong> Knowing this patient’s history supports our presumption of electrical alternans. The patient is a longtime smoker suspected of having lung cancer. He now presents with acute dyspnea and a large heart shadow on chest X-ray. In view of <strong><em>electrical</em> alternans</strong> on ECG — a large <strong><em>pericardial</em> effusion</strong> with possible tamponade should be suspected. An <strong>Echo</strong> should be done in timely fashion (<strong>Figure 14.4-2</strong>).</li><li><em>Beyond-the-Core:</em> Overall QRS amplitude appears <em>reduced</em> in Figure 14.4-1 — especially for <em>every-other-QRS</em> complex. The finding of <strong><em>low</em> voltage</strong> in the context of the above history and electrical alternans all support the likelihood of finding a significant pericardial effusion. An <strong>Echo</strong> is the investigative procedure of choice (Figure 14.4-2).</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Figure 14.4-2:</strong> Serial 4-chamber views from the Echo performed on the patient whose ECG was shown in Figure 14.4-1. An extremely large pericardial effusion is seen (<em>arrows</em>). As a result — a <em>“swinging heart”</em> pendular motion is set up. This marked <em>free-floating</em> displacement of the heart occurs in phasic fashion within the <em>fluid-filled</em> pericardial sac — and accounts for the dramatic <em>beat-to-beat</em> variability in QRS amplitude and direction that was seen in Figure 14.4-1.</p><p>ACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Jenda Enis Stros for allowing me to use the ECG in Figure 14.3-1 — and to Jason Roediger for allowing me to use the case, ECG and Echo in Figures 14.4-1 and 14.4-2.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>🍻反向連結</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/EKG-pocket-brain/ data-ctx=PocketBrain data-src=/EKG-pocket-brain class=internal-link>EKG pocket brain</a></li><li><a href=/Takotsubo/ data-ctx=PocketBrain data-src=/Takotsubo class=internal-link>Takotsubo</a></li><li><a href=/abdominal-pain/ data-ctx=PocketBrain data-src=/abdominal-pain class=internal-link>abdominal pain</a></li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>互動圖</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://www.physician.tw/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//physician.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>由 Hsieh-Ting Lin 以❤️ 用 <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a> 種出來🪴 , © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.physician.tw/>首頁</a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/Tim.H.Lin>Facebook</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/htlin222>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/htlin222>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://htlin.site>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/@hsieh-ting-lin>Medium</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
