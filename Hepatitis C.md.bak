# Hepatitis C
 > (ssRNA; ~10% of acute viral hepatitis in U.S.; Lancet 2015;385:1124)
* [[Recommended First-Line Oral Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) Regimens]]
 * Transmission: blood (IVDU, transfusion before 1992) >sexual; 20–30% w/o clear precipitant
* Incubation: 1–5 mo; mean 6–7 wk
* [[hepatitis C virus acute infxn]]
* Chronic: up to 85% → chronic hepatitis, 20–30% of whom develop cirrhosis (after ~20 y)
↑ risk of cirrhosis in men, EtOH, HIV; HCC in 1–4% of Pts w/ cirrhosis per year

* [[hepatitis C virus extrahepatic syndromes]]
* [[hepatitis C virus Serologic, virologic, & genetic tests]]

## [[hepatitis C virus Monitoring on Rx]]

* Goal is sustained virologic response (SVR) = Ø viremia 12 wks after completion of Rx. Success depends on genotype but SVR rates >90% with current regimens.

* Special populations (HCV/HIV coinfection, decompensated cirrhosis, s/p liver transplant, renal impairment): www.hcvguidelines.com for updated recs on mgmt

* Vaccinate all chronic HCV patients against HBV and HAV if not immune

* Postexposure (needlestick risk ~3%) Ppx: none, although sofosbuvir-velpatasivir under investigation in clinical trial; if HCV RNA → ⊕, consider Rx w/in 3 mos
