Hamilton, MD</strong></p><a href=#chief-complaint><h3 id=chief-complaint><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. C is a 35-year-old man who comes to your outpatient office complaining of 3 days of diarrhea.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of diarrhea? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>A first step in assessing diarrhea is to categorize the frequency and duration of bowel movements. Diarrhea is defined as at least 3 loose bowel movements per day. Often patients and clinicians will mislabel loose bowel movements as diarrhea solely because the stool is loose. If a patient does fit the clinical criteria for diarrhea, the diarrhea can be further characterized as acute, persistent, or chronic. Acute diarrhea has a duration of less than 14 days, persistent diarrhea 14–29 days, and chronic diarrhea at least 30 days. The differential diagnosis varies significantly based on the duration of symptoms. This chapter focuses specifically on diagnosis and treatment of acute diarrhea.</p><p>Acute diarrhea can be further subcategorized into infectious and noninfectious causes, with infectious causes accounting for the majority of cases of acute, self-limited diarrheal illnesses.</p><p>Several factors are important in reasoning through a case of acute diarrhea including (1) associated signs and symptoms, (2) duration of symptoms, (3) exposure history, (4) history of immunosuppressive conditions, and (5) epidemiology of specific infectious pathogens.</p><p>A detailed history of symptoms and exposures helps guide the evaluation and treatment of acute diarrhea. Noninfectious diarrhea is typically characterized by lack of constitutional symptoms and presence of a culprit medication, supplement, food, or other condition (eg, pancreatic insufficiency). Therefore, taking a thorough history of medications, supplements, diet, and underlying medical conditions is essential to prioritize an initial differential diagnosis for acute diarrhea.</p><p>Infectious diarrhea can be associated with symptoms such as fever, myalgias, severe abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and stool with blood or mucus. However, lack of any of these symptoms does not rule out a diagnosis of infectious diarrhea. Symptoms of infectious diarrhea may also suggest whether the diarrhea originates in the large or small bowel, which can narrow the likelihood of specific pathogens. Patients with large volume, watery bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, and gas are more likely to have gastroenteritis and the pathogens most commonly associated with this condition. Mucus or blood in the stool is rarely present in gastroenteritis. In contrast, patients with tenesmus and passage of many small-volume stools with blood and/or mucus are more likely to have colitis and the pathogens more commonly associated with this condition.</p><p>Figure 13-1 presents a clinical algorithm and a broad differential diagnosis using this framework.</p><p><strong>Figure 13-1.</strong> Diagnostic approach to diarrhea.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Noninfectious diarrhea</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Medications and other ingestible substances (some with osmotic effect)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Sorbitol (gum, mints, pill fillers)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Mannitol</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Fructose (fruits, soft drinks)</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Fiber (bran, fruits, vegetables)</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Lactulose</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Magnesium-containing medications</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Nutritional supplements</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Antacids</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Laxatives</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Malabsorption</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Lactose intolerance</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Pancreatitis</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Medications causing diarrhea through nonosmotic means</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Metformin</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Antibiotics</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Colchicine</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Digoxin</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Infectious diarrhea</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Gastroenteritis</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Viral (most common)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Caliciviruses (including norovirus)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Rotovirus</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Bacterial</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  <em>Vibrio cholera</em></p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  <em>Escherichia coli</em></p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  <em>Shigella</em> species</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  <em>Salmonella</em> species</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  <em>Campylobacter</em> species</p><p><strong>(6)</strong>  <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em></p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Preformed toxin-mediated</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  <em>Clostridium perfringens</em></p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  <em>Bacillus cereus</em></p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Colitis</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  <em>Shigella</em> species</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  <em>E coli</em></p><p><strong>c.</strong>  <em>Campylobacter</em> species</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  <em>Salmonella</em> species</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  <em>Y enterocolitica</em></p><p><strong>f.</strong>  <em>Clostridium difficile</em></p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Cytomegalovirus</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Adenovirus</p><p>The first symptom the patient noted was loss of appetite while eating breakfast. He was unable to finish his usual cup of coffee and bowl of cereal. During his 20-minute drive to work he became nauseated and diaphoretic. Upon arriving at work, he had a low-grade fever and abdominal cramping and then soon after had an episode of vomiting. Over the next 24 hours, diarrhea developed with 5 bowel movements during that time. He describes the stool being watery and brown without any blood. He has no medical problems and takes no medications or supplements. He has had no recent changes in his diet.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Naming the problem in the most descriptive possible way, taking into account the pivotal points in the presentation, is an important first step in prioritizing a differential diagnosis. In this case, the problem could be called <em>acute-onset, watery diarrhea</em>, or even <em>acute-onset gastroenteritis</em>. Correspondingly, the differential diagnosis should focus on causes of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis. The presence of constitutional symptoms and the lack of concurrent medical conditions, offending foods, supplements, and medications make causes of noninfectious diarrhea much less likely. When prioritizing a differential diagnosis, assessing the epidemiology, or frequency of diagnoses in the population of interest, is helpful. In cases of acute diarrhea, at least 87% result from infectious causes. Therefore, based on the epidemiology of acute diarrhea, an infectious etiology is more likely. The presence of nausea and vomiting and lack of colitis-associated symptoms of mucous, blood, and tenesmus makes pathogens that cause gastroenteritis more probable.</p><p>To prioritize the differential diagnosis, a thorough travel, exposure, medical, and sexual history is essential. International travel is especially important given the regional differences in epidemiology of infectious pathogens. Exposure history should include detailed dietary history, water exposures through drinking or swimming, healthcare exposure, antibiotic exposure, contact with animals, known sick contacts, and exposure to childcare settings. Table 13-1 lists specific exposures and corresponding pathogens. Past medical history should focus on known history of immunocompromising conditions, medications, or history of past infections that would raise suspicion of an immunocompromising condition such as HIV. The most common pathogens associated with diarrhea in immunocompetent persons are also the most common in immunosuppressed persons, but opportunistic pathogens—such as parasites (eg, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>Cystoisospora)</em> and microsporidia; bacteria (eg, <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex); and viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus)—increase in prevalence.</p><p><strong>Table 13-1.</strong> Exposures and corresponding pathogens.</p><p>Timing of onset of symptoms relative to a potential culprit food exposure may also help determine a potential causative pathogen. Diarrheal illness caused by preformed toxins often cause symptoms within several hours of exposure, whereas non-toxin–mediated diarrheal illnesses have incubation periods of at least 24 hours.</p><p>Mr. C is otherwise in good health. He reports no recent illnesses or antibiotic exposures. There have been no recent changes in his diet and he has eaten only food prepared at home for the last week. He lives with his wife. He works as a bus driver. He has not traveled out of New York City, where he lives and works. He reports no known sick contacts, but he has a 2-year-old child in daycare that he drops off and picks up every weekday. He has no pets at home and has had no recent contact with animals.</p><p>The physical exam is notable for temperature, 38.2°C; BP is 110/80 mm Hg and pulse is 100 bpm while lying down; BP is 90/72 mm Hg and pulse is 126 bpm while standing; RR, 12 breaths per minute. Sclera and conjunctiva are normal. The abdomen is soft and diffusely tender with hyperactive bowel sounds. The rectal exam shows brown, heme-negative stool.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><p>Table 13-2 lists the differential diagnosis for Mr. C.</p><p><strong>Table 13-2.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. C.</p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-norovirus><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-norovirus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Norovirus</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Acute vomiting is usually the presenting symptom. The onset of diarrhea typically follows the vomiting. Mild abdominal cramping and low-grade fever are common. Symptoms typically resolve by 3 days.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Calciviruses, of which norovirus and closely related viruses such as sapovirus are the most common cause of adult viral gastroenteritis, account for about 80% of cases.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Most commonly occurs in winter.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Transmission</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Norovirus is easily transmissible via the fecal-oral route, airborne droplets, food, and fomites.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne diarrhea, and numerous outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, catered events, and cruise ships.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Norovirus is very stable in the environment, resisting chlorine and alcohol disinfectants.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Attack rates as high as 50% have been documented in outbreaks.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Incubation period is 1–2 days.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  In almost all cases, norovirus should be diagnosed clinically based on consistent symptoms as well as ruling out exposures or risk factors that would make diagnostic testing necessary.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is available to confirm a diagnosis, but testing should be reserved for public health investigations and in patients who have reasons for diagnostic testing (see Figure 13-1).</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  PCR is available as a part of some molecular multipathogen stool panels, which are increasing in clinical use. However, testing should not be performed as most cases of norovirus can be diagnosed clinically.</p><a href=#treatment><h5 id=treatment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Supportive care</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Most patients with acute diarrhea require only supportive care. Supportive care is meant to provide rehydration and symptom relief.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Rehydration</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Oral rehydration is generally sufficient.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  For patients with mild diarrhea and little volume depletion, oral fluids (eg, sports drinks, pediatric electrolyte drinks, and soup broth) are appropriate rehydration.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  For patients with more significant volume depletion, oral rehydration solutions should contain NaCl, KCl, HCO3 or citrate, and glucose. The World Health Organization oral rehydration solution has the following composition:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Sodium: 75 mmol/L</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Chloride: 65 mmol/L</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Glucose: 75 mmol/L</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Potassium: 20 mmol/L</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Citrate: 10 mmol/L</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  If this solution is not available, patients can be instructed to mix the following in 1 L of water</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  One-half teaspoon of salt</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  One-quarter teaspoon of baking soda</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  8 teaspoons of sugar</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  In patients who cannot tolerate oral rehydration or who are very volume depleted, intravenous fluids (lactated Ringer solution or normal saline) are indicated.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Antidiarrheals (such as loperamide) are safe and effective for patients without bloody diarrhea (dysentery) or concern for <em>C difficile</em> infection. Using antidiarrheals in a patient with dysentery or <em>C difficile</em> may lead to:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Prolonged fever</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Toxic megacolon and colonic perforation</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients with <em>Shiga</em> toxin–producing <em>E coli</em> (STEC).</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Antiemetics</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Diet</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  BRAT diet (banana, rice, applesauce, toast) is often recommended.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Dairy products should be avoided.

Do other tests need to be done to exclude the alternative diagnoses?</strong></p><p>In this case, given the classic symptoms, childcare exposure, and epidemiologic likelihood of norovirus as a cause of community-acquired gastroenteritis, it is the most likely diagnosis. The clinical history, lack of suspicious exposures, and the lower frequency of other causes in community-acquired gastroenteritis (see Table 13-3) make other causes less likely. Although toxin-mediated gastroenteritis is a consideration, there is no commercially available diagnostic testing, and treatment is supportive. There are sporadic cases of other causes of infectious diarrhea such as <em>Salmonella</em>, but almost all of these infections resolve spontaneously. No diagnostic testing is warranted in this case due to lack of severe symptoms or risk factors for complication. In fact, only 2–15% of tests for bacterial pathogens are positive and only 0.4–0.7% of tests for ova and parasites are positive in resource-rich settings.

Finally, other must not miss diagnoses include those that could progress rapidly to life-threatening infections, including <em>C difficile, Vibrio</em> species, and enteric fever caused by <em>Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi.</em> However, in almost all cases, these diagnoses can be ruled out by a careful history, and additional testing is not warranted unless associated characteristics and risks are identified.</p><p>In this case, no compelling reason for diagnostic testing or treatment is present.</p><p>In most patients with an acute diarrheal illness, diagnostic testing is not helpful to the patient but may be important from a public health standpoint.</p><a href=#alternative-diagnosis-toxin-mediated-gastroenteritis><h4 id=alternative-diagnosis-toxin-mediated-gastroenteritis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Alternative Diagnosis: Toxin-Mediated Gastroenteritis</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-1><h5 id=textbook-presentation-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>The presentation of this syndrome, most commonly caused by <em>S aureus</em> or <em>C perfringens,</em> usually includes acute-onset vomiting and crampy abdominal pain.

There has been no blood in his stool.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Key elements in the patient’s current presentation include the 10-day duration of the symptoms, lack of constitutional symptoms, recent gastrointestinal illness, and recent exposure to antibiotics. These key features suggest that both infectious and noninfectious causes should be considered. Both the duration of symptoms and the recent gastroenteritis should raise the possibility of lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is common after gastroenteritis due to injury to the small bowel mucosa. Other potential diagnoses include recurrent gastroenteritis, side effect of the antibiotic, and <em>C difficile</em> infection. Recurrent infectious gastroenteritis can occur since many of the bacteria that cause diarrhea can persist in the stool after clinical symptoms have resolved. This feature is especially common with <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter.</em> Antibiotics also have been associated with a paradoxical prolonged carriage rate especially in non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella</em> infections, possibly due to their effect on the intestinal microbiome.</p><p>Diarrhea is also a common side effect of antibiotics and complicates as much as 25% of antibiotic courses. Given the recent antibiotic exposure, <em>C difficile</em> infection should also be considered. The prolonged nature of the illness should prompt consideration of the less typical pathogens, such as parasites, but if testing is considered necessary, it should focus on pathogens that may be endemic to the specific regions of exposure. Table 13-5 reviews the differential diagnosis for this presentation. A targeted history focused on association with milk and milk-containing foods or new medications as well as any new exposures or symptoms will help further prioritize the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 13-5.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. C’s repeat visit.</p><p>The patient describes 3–4 soft bowel movements a day. He has no abdominal pain, but has bloating and belching. He says he goes to the bathroom 3 or 4 additional times each day just to pass gas.</p><p>The patient took 3 doses of amoxicillin on the day he first came to see you. He ran out after these 3 doses. The onset of the diarrhea occurred after completing the antibiotics. He has not traveled since his infection and does not note any unusual exposures. He reports that he had kept to the “BRAT diet” for a couple days after recovery, but started to reintroduce more cereal, rice, potatoes, milk, and yogurt as he began to feel better.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

A complete blood count and basic metabolic panel are normal. Orthostatic symptoms resolve with intravenous fluids.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, <em>Shigella</em> infection? Have you ruled out the active alternatives? Do other tests need to be done to exclude the alternative diagnoses?</strong></p><p>Because most infectious diarrhea is self-limited, stool cultures and other directed testing for bacterial pathogens do not need to be performed on every patient. Testing should be selective in order to facilitate pathogen detection in groups that benefit the most, while decreasing likelihood of false-positive testing. Details of testing strategies are included in Table 13-7.</p><p><strong>Table 13-7.</strong> Testing for specific causative pathogens of diarrhea.</p><p>Many laboratories are now using multipathogen gastrointestinal panels, which identify a range of bacterial, viral, and parasitic causes of diarrhea from a single specimen. These tests are often more sensitive than non-molecular tests and do not require clinicians to order different tests for each suspected pathogen. However, these methods are not able to determine antibiotic susceptibility, so some pathogens identified by these panels require a reflex culture.</p><p>Patients who may benefit the most from treatment and are highest yield for diagnostic testing include:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Patients with severe illness (bloody stool, fever, severe abdominal pain, > 6 bowel movements per day, hypovolemia, and need for hospitalization);</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Specific exposures that increase risk of pathogens that benefit from treatment (travel, high-risk sexual encounters, antibiotics);</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Patients with conditions that increase the risk of complications (immunosuppression, inflammatory bowel disease, pregnancy, and advanced age); and</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Situations with public health implications (confirmed or possible outbreak or patients who are at high risk for spreading disease, such as healthcare workers, food handlers, and childcare workers).</p><p>In the past, testing for fecal leukocytes has been recommended in the diagnostic work-up of acute diarrhea with the highest reported sensitivity for infectious or inflammatory diarrhea of 71–73% and specificity of 79–84%. However, the performance characteristics are widely variable in different settings. In addition, this test is not diagnostic of a particular infection and does not generally change management or outcomes. Therefore, fecal leukocyte testing should not be used routinely in the diagnostic work-up of acute diarrhea. Fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin are newer tests that have been used for the diagnosis of inflammatory diarrhea, but there is insufficient evidence to support their routine clinical use for guiding the management and diagnostic testing for acute diarrhea.</p><p>Although <em>Shigella</em> infection is most likely in this case, diagnostic testing should be performed because other pathogens including <em>Campylobacter</em> and STEC are still possible, and the management of these pathogens is different.</p><a href=#case-resolution-2><h3 id=case-resolution-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>The patient was treated with supportive therapy. Antidiarrheals were withheld because of his bloody diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin was prescribed empirically due to his severe symptoms. His stool was sent for multipathogen molecular testing, which identified <em>Shigella</em>. Reflex culture grew <em>Shigella flexneri</em> that was susceptible to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>In this case, the acute and bloody nature of the diarrhea allowed for the differential diagnosis to be focused on specific pathogens using the initial approach presented in this chapter. Epidemiologic factors, symptoms, and exposures allowed for further focusing of the differential diagnosis, which, in turn guided the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring.</p><a href=#review-of-other-important-diseases><h3 id=review-of-other-important-diseases><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>REVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES</h3></a><a href=#travelers-diarrhea><h4 id=travelers-diarrhea><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Travelers’ Diarrhea</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-9><h5 id=textbook-presentation-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Patients with travelers’ diarrhea usually become ill in the first 5 days of their trip from resource-rich regions to resource-limited ones.
