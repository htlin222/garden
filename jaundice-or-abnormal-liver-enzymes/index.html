It is helpful to review some basic physiology first.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Oxidation of the heme moiety of hemoglobin generates biliverdin, which is metabolized into unconjugated bilirubin, and then bound to albumin.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  There are 3 steps in bilirubin metabolism in the liver (Figure 26-1):</p><p><strong>Figure 26-1.</strong> Bilirubin metabolism and excretion.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Uptake: The unconjugated bilirubin-albumin complex reaches the hepatocyte; bilirubin dissociates from albumin and then enters the hepatocyte.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Conjugation: Unconjugated bilirubin and glucuronic acid combine to make conjugated bilirubin.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Excretion: The hepatocyte excretes conjugated bilirubin into the bile.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The rate-limiting step of bilirubin metabolism in the liver</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  If excretion is impaired, conjugated bilirubin enters the hepatic sinusoids and then the bloodstream.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Conjugated bilirubin in the bile is transported through the biliary ducts into the duodenum; it is not reabsorbed by the intestine.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Can be excreted unchanged in the stool</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Can be converted to urobilinogen by colonic bacteria</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Urobilinogen can be reabsorbed, entering the portal circulation.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Some is taken up by the liver and re-excreted into the bile.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Some bypasses the liver and is excreted by the kidney, thus appearing in the urine in small amounts.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Can be converted in the bowel to stercobilin rendering the stool brown.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Unconjugated bilirubin is not found in the urine because it is bound to albumin and cannot be filtered by the glomeruli.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Conjugated bilirubin is filtered and excreted in the urine when there is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p>The first pivotal point in the differential diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia is determining which kind of bilirubin is elevated.</p><p>Dark, tea-colored urine means the patient has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p>Light stools, often described as “clay colored,” occur when extrahepatic obstruction prevents bilirubin from entering the intestine.</p><p>If the patient has unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (> 50% of the bilirubin is unconjugated), use a pathophysiologic framework:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Increased bilirubin production</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hemolysis</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Dyserythropoiesis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Extravasation of blood into tissues</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Heart failure</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Sepsis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Drugs (rifampin, probenecid, gemfibrozil, atazanavir)</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Fasting</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Portosystemic shunts</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Impaired bilirubin conjugation (decreased hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hereditary</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Gilbert syndrome</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Crigler-Najjar syndrome</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Acquired</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Neonates</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hyperthyroidism</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Ethinyl estradiol</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Liver disease (causes mixed hyperbilirubinemia; usually predominantly conjugated)</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Sepsis</p><p>Most patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome, heart failure, sepsis, or very advanced cirrhosis.</p><p>Although many sources organize the differential diagnosis for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (when > 50% is conjugated) using a pathophysiologic framework, a more practical, clinical approach uses the results of other liver biochemical tests first:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Normal liver enzymes (ALT, AST)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Sepsis or systemic infection</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Rotor syndrome</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Dubin-Johnson syndrome</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Elevated liver enzymes</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hepatocellular pattern: transaminases more elevated than alkaline phosphatase, suggesting primary hepatocellular damage</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Marked transaminase elevations (> 1000 units/L)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Acute viral hepatitis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Ischemic hepatitis</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Medication- or toxin-induced hepatitis</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Autoimmune hepatitis</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Acute bile duct obstruction</p><p><strong>(6)</strong>  Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Mild to moderate elevations (mild elevation: defined as &lt;

The differential of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is relatively limited. If the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated, the second step is to determine whether there is extrahepatic obstruction or intrinsic hepatocellular dysfunction due to 1 of many possible etiologies. Although other liver biochemical tests can serve as a guide, it is clear from the way the above differentials overlap that these tests are not very specific. Table 26-1 summarizes the commonly used liver tests. Figure 26-2 outlines the diagnostic approach to hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p><strong>Table 26-1.</strong> Biochemical markers used to evaluate the liver.</p><p><strong>Figure 26-2.</strong> Diagnostic approach to hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p>Ms. B also tells you she has dark urine, anorexia, and fatigue. She has no nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or fever. Ms. B’s physical exam shows scleral icterus and jaundice as well as hepatomegaly, with her liver edge palpable 7 cm below the costal margin. The liver extends across the midline, and the spleen tip is palpable. There is no abdominal tenderness or distention. There is no peripheral edema, and the rest of her exam is normal.</p><p><strong>How reliable is the physical exam for detecting signs of liver disease?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Jaundice</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Detectable on physical exam when total bilirubin is > 2.5–3.0 mg/dL.</p><p>Scleral icterus is detectable before jaundice of the skin.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  For bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dL, sensitivity of physical exam is 78.4% and specificity is 68.8% (LR+ 2.5; LR–, 0.31).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  For bilirubin > 15.0 mg/dL, sensitivity of physical exam is 96.4%.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Hepatomegaly</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  On ultrasound, the upper limit of normal for the cephalocaudad dimension of the liver is 13 cm.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  While examiners are always correct when they report palpating the liver edge (LR+ = 233), a palpable liver edge is not a reliable sign of hepatomegaly (LR+, 2.0; LR–, 0.41) since the liver may be pushed caudally by enlarged lungs.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Splenomegaly</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Percussion methods have poor test characteristics and are nondiagnostic.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Palpation of a spleen in a supine position is highly predictive of splenomegaly: LR+, 8.2; LR–, 0.41.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Ascites</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The best 3 historical findings are</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Increased abdominal girth (LR+, 4.1; LR−, 0.17)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Recent weight gain (LR+, 3.2; LR–, 0.42)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Ankle swelling (LR+, 2.80; LR−, 0.10)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The best physical exam findings are</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Fluid wave (LR+, 5.3; LR−, 0.57)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Shifting dullness (LR+, 2.1; LR−, 0.4)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Proper physical exam technique must be used to obtain these LRs.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Ultrasonography can detect minimal ascites, far less than could ever be detected on physical exam.</p><p>Given the pivotal historical point (dark urine) and the physical exam findings of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, you are confident that Ms. B has hyperbilirubinemia and suspect that it will be primarily conjugated. You obtain the following initial tests: total bilirubin, 13 mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 9.6 mg/dL; AST, 250 units/L; ALT, 113 units/L; alkaline phosphatase, 503 units/L; albumin, 2.8 g/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 15.4 s (control 11.1 s); WBC = 22,000 cells/mcL with 80% PMNs, 16% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes. The platelet count is normal.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The pattern of the biochemical abnormalities is the next pivotal point to consider. The combination of a substantially elevated alkaline phosphatase and moderately elevated transaminases is consistent with a cholestatic pattern due to either a disease causing intrahepatic cholestasis or to extrahepatic obstruction. Viral or alcoholic hepatitis, with or without cirrhosis, would be the most common diseases that cause both hepatocellular and cholestatic abnormalities; the AST being greater than the ALT is a pivotal finding that points toward alcoholic liver disease. The physical exam findings of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly both modestly increase the likelihood of chronic liver disease (LR+, 2.3 for hepatomegaly; 2.9 for splenomegaly). Extrahepatic obstruction must also be considered, since she could have an obstruction in addition to chronic liver disease. Cancer and stricture are more likely causes of painless jaundice than common bile duct stones. Pancreatic cancer is the most common malignancy that causes extrahepatic obstruction; cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary carcinoma are 2 other possibilities. Occasionally, obstruction is due to benign polyps in the biliary tree. Table 26-2 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 26-2.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. B.</p><p>Ms. B had a blood transfusion in Latvia in 1996. She has no history of injection drug use, tattoos, or smoking, but she has consumed between 2 glasses and 1 bottle of wine daily for years. Her past medical history is notable only for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>–positive gastric and duodenal ulcers 6 years ago, treated with eradication therapy.

An imaging study is necessary not to rule in ALD but rather to exclude alternative diagnoses. As discussed in Chapter 3, Abdominal Pain, ultrasonography is the best first test to look for stones in the gallbladder, although the sensitivity is less for common bile duct stones. However, in this patient, pancreatic cancer or other malignancies are more likely causes of extrabiliary obstruction than stones. Although an abdominal CT scan is arguably a better first test to exclude these possibilities, an ultrasound is often obtained first in clinical practice due to its lower cost and lack of adverse effects. Tests for hepatitis are necessary in all patients with liver disease and are especially important in Ms. B because of her history of a blood transfusion.</p><p>Ms. B has an ultrasound that reveals no stones in the gallbladder and no common bile duct stones. An abdominal CT scan is obtained next, which shows an enlarged, nodular liver, moderate ascites, and a normal pancreas. Her ANA, hepatitis A IgM antibody, HBsAg, hepatitis B IgM core antibody, and hepatitis C antibody are all negative.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed the diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, alcoholic hepatitis?

At this point, some clinicians would proceed with treatment for alcoholic hepatitis, while others would confirm the diagnosis and, for prognostic purposes, establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis with a liver biopsy.</p><p>Her liver biopsy showed acute alcoholic hepatitis with cirrhosis.

He has felt tired and a bit queasy for the last couple of weeks but thought he was just overworked and anxious. He has had some aching pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, not related to eating or bowel movements. He has had no fevers, chills, or sweats. He has noticed dark urine for 1 or 2 days but attributed it to not drinking enough.</p><p>On physical exam, he appears tired. He has scleral icterus; his liver is palpable 2 cm below the costal margin and is mildly tender. The spleen is not palpable, and the rest of his abdomen is nontender and nondistended. He has no edema, and the rest of his exam is normal.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis?

Hepatitis A is the most frequent cause of acute viral hepatitis; hepatitis C is the second most frequent but is usually asymptomatic acutely. Hepatitis B can also present acutely. By virtue of being common, alcoholic hepatitis is another active alternative diagnosis, and the presentation can mimic that of viral hepatitis. Biliary obstruction is always a consideration in patients with jaundice, but the prodrome and type of abdominal pain are not typical. Table 26-3 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 26-3.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. R.</p><p>He has no past medical history and takes no medications; he does not smoke or use illicit drugs. He drinks 1–2 beers most weeks, and occasionally shares a bottle of wine with friends. He has never had a blood transfusion or a tattoo, and has had only 1 sexual partner. He enjoys trying different restaurants, and frequently eats sushi and ceviche. Initial laboratory tests include the following: total bilirubin, 6.5 mg/dL; conjugated bilirubin, 4 mg/dL; ALT, 1835 units/L; AST, 1522 units/L; alkaline phosphatase, 175 units/L; WBC, 9800 cells/mcL (normal differential); Hb, 14.5 g/dL; HCT, 44%.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><p>Pivotal points in Mr. R’s lab tests include the following: he has a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a hepatocellular pattern, marked elevation of the transaminases, and the ALT is greater than the AST. This pattern is consistent with viral hepatitis. Exploring his history, he does not have clear risk factors for hepatitis B or C, but does have potential exposure to contaminated food, suggesting possible hepatitis A.</p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-hepatitis-a><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-hepatitis-a><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Hepatitis A</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-2><h5 id=textbook-presentation-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>The classic presentation is the gradual onset of malaise, nausea, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain, followed by jaundice.</p><a href=#disease-highlights-2><h5 id=disease-highlights-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Prevalence: Accounts for approximately half of cases of viral hepatitis in the United States.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Clinical manifestations</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Symptoms develop in 70–80% of adults, compared with &lt; 30% of children under the age of 6.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Average incubation period is 28 days (range 15–50 days), followed by prodromal symptoms of fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, and right upper pain; about 1 week later, jaundice appears.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  70% of patients have jaundice, and 80% have hepatomegaly.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Other physical findings include splenomegaly, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, arthritis, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Uncommon extrahepatic manifestations include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Transmission</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Fecal-oral transmission, either sporadically or in an epidemic form</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Contaminated water, shellfish, frozen strawberries, etc.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Contamination from infected restaurant worker</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  No specific exposure history in 55% of cases</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  No maternal-fetal transmission</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Clinical course</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Generally self-limited, with rare cases of fulminant hepatic failure (0.015–0.5% of patients with hepatitis A)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Fulminant course is more common in patients with underlying hepatitis C or other chronic liver diseases.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  1.1% fatality rate in adults > age 40</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  85% of patients fully recover in 3 months, and nearly 100% by 6 months</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Transaminases normalize more rapidly than serum bilirubin.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Prevention</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Vaccination is available for preexposure prophylaxis.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Immunity develops within 4 weeks in 90% of patients and within 26 weeks in 100% of patients.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  A second dose given 6–12 months later provides persistent immunity.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Can use immune serum globulin with vaccination for postexposure prophylaxis.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  For otherwise healthy patients between ages 12 months and 40 years, only vaccination is recommended; immune serum globulin can still be considered.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  For patients &lt; 12 months, > 40 years, or any age who are immunocompromised, such as those with chronic liver disease, immune serum globulin should be administered.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Immune globulin is 69–89% effective in preventing symptomatic illness when used within 2 weeks of exposure.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  A randomized trial comparing vaccination with immune globulin given within 14 days of exposure found that hepatitis A developed in 4.4% of vaccine recipients and 3.3% of immune globulin recipients (relative risk = 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 2.67).</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-2><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Liver biochemical tests</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  ALT and AST are generally over 1000 units/L, and may be as high as 10,000 units/L; ALT is generally > AST.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Bilirubin is commonly > 10 mg/dL.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Alkaline phosphatase is usually modestly elevated.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Antibody tests (Figure 26-3)</p><p><strong>Figure 26-3.</strong> Natural history of hepatitis A symptoms and antibodies.

She feels fine. Her past medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her medications include metformin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril. She does not smoke and has a glass of wine about twice per month. She has no history of blood transfusions or injection drug use. Her physical exam shows a BP of 125/80 mm Hg, pulse of 80 bpm, RR of 16 breaths per minute, weight 230 lbs, and height 5 ft 9 in (BMI = 34.0). Pulmonary, cardiac, and abdominal exams are all normal.</p><p>She shows you blood test results from a recent health fair at work: creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL; HbA1C, 6.8%; LDL, 95 mg/dL; platelet count, 272/mcL; bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; AST, 85 units/L; ALT, 92 units/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; and a normal alkaline phosphatase. She reports she was told a few months ago that 1 of her liver tests was a little abnormal. No one in her family has had liver disease, but her mother has thyroid disease. She does recall taking several acetaminophen tablets in the days prior to the recent blood test.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>In the absence of an obvious nonhepatic cause of liver enzyme elevations, the initial approach is to focus on the hepatic causes. The prevalence of the liver diseases in the differential diagnosis varies widely, depending on the population studied. For example, in a study of over 19,000 young, healthy military recruits, of whom 99 had enzyme elevations, only 11 were found to have any liver disease (4 had hepatitis B, 4 had hepatitis C, 2 had autoimmune hepatitis, 1 had cholelithiasis). A study of 100 blood donors with elevated enzymes found that 48% had ALD, 22% had NAFLD, and 17% had hepatitis C. In another study, patients with elevated enzymes in whom a diagnosis could not be made by history or blood tests underwent liver biopsy; NAFLD was found in over 50% of them.</p><p>Pivotal points in Ms. H’s presentation include that the transaminase abnormalities are mild and probably chronic. The key findings in the history and physical exam are the patient’s diabetes and elevated body mass index (BMI). NAFLD is extremely common in obese, diabetic patients, so Ms. H is at high risk for this disease. She has no specific risk factors for viral hepatitis, but often the exposure history is unclear and these diagnoses cannot be ruled out without further testing. Her alcohol intake is minimal, but sometimes even small amounts of alcohol can cause liver enzyme elevations. Additionally, other drug and toxin exposures always should be considered. Even therapeutic doses of acetaminophen can cause transaminitis; in 1 study, 50% of patients taking 4 g of acetaminophen daily developed transaminases > 2 times the upper limit of normal. Mild transaminase elevations are seen in 0.5–3% of patients taking statins (it is not necessary to stop the statin in such cases, and the FDA no longer recommends routine testing after obtaining a baseline at the start of therapy). Finally, her family history of thyroid disease, presumably autoimmune, increases the likelihood of autoimmune hepatitis or hyperthyroidism. Hemochromatosis can also present with liver enzyme abnormalities and diabetes mellitus.

As was done with Ms. H, the first step is to stop alcohol and, if possible, potentially hepatotoxic medications, and then remeasure the liver enzymes. Although aspects of the history can increase the likelihood of a specific diagnosis, the history is not sensitive or specific enough to make a diagnosis, and it is necessary to test somewhat broadly. If liver enzyme abnormalities persist after stopping alcohol and potentially hepatotoxic medications, the American Gastroenterological Association recommends beginning with a PT; serum albumin; CBC; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], ferritin).</p><p>IgM and IgG anti-HAV are both negative. HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc are negative; IgG anti-HBc and anti-HBs are positive. Anti-HCV is negative. The transferrin saturation is 35%, and the serum ferritin is 190 ng/mL.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, NAFLD?
