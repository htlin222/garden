How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The differential diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) is actually a classification of the different types of diabetes:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Type 1 DM</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Of the persons with DM in Canada, the United States, and Europe, 5–10% have type 1.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Caused by cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells in genetically susceptible individuals, triggered by an undefined environmental agent</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Some combination of antibodies against islet cells, insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), or tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2beta are found in 85–90% of patients.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Strong HLA association</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Risk is 0.4% in patients without family history, 5–6% in siblings and children, and 30% in monozygotic twins.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Patients are also prone to autoimmune thyroid disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, celiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Insulin therapy is always necessary.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  <strong>Because of the complete lack of insulin production,</strong> patients are at high risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Type 2 DM</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Caused by a progressive loss of beta cell insulin secretion frequently with underlying insulin resistance</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  A heterogeneous disorder related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and genetic factors</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Other, less common causes of diabetes</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Monogenic diabetes syndromes</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Exocrine pancreatic diseases that lead to the destruction of beta cells (pancreatitis, trauma, cystic fibrosis, pancreatectomy, pancreatic carcinoma)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Endocrinopathies (acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma)</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Drug or chemical-induced (corticosteroids, HIV/AIDS medications, after organ transplantation)</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Gestational diabetes</p><p>Type 1 DM generally occurs in children, although approximately 7.5–10% of adults assumed to have type 2 DM actually have type 1, as defined by the presence of circulating antibodies. Type 2 DM is becoming more prevalent in teenagers and young adults, presumably related to the increased prevalence of obesity.</p><p>In most patients, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 DM is clear. Thus, the primary tasks of the clinician are to determine who should be tested for diabetes, who has diabetes, which complications to monitor, and how to treat the patient.</p><p>Mrs. D has worried about having diabetes since her father died of complications from the disease. Over the last couple of weeks, she has been urinating more often and notes larger volumes than usual. She is aware that excess urination can be a symptom of diabetes, so she scheduled an appointment.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mrs. D’s pretest probability of diabetes is high because of 2 pivotal points in her history, the polyuria and the positive family history. Excess fluid intake and diseases that cause true polyuria, defined as urinary output of > 3 L/day, should also be considered. Bladder dysfunction and urinary tract infection generally cause frequent, small volume urination. Since patients sometimes have trouble quantifying the amount of urine produced, causes of small volume urinary frequency should be kept in the differential. Table 12-1 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 12-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. D.</p><p>Mrs. D has no dysuria or hematuria. She takes no medications, drinks 1 cup of coffee per day, and uses alcohol rarely. She has been trying to lose weight and has been drinking more water in an attempt to reduce her appetite.</p><p>On physical exam, she looks a bit tired. Vital signs are temperature, 37.0°C; BP, 138/82 mm Hg; pulse, 96 bpm; RR, 16 breaths per minute. The remainder of the physical exam is normal. A random plasma glucose is 152 mg/dL.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-type-2-dm><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-type-2-dm><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Type 2 DM</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Patients with type 2 DM can have the classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. The presentation can also be more subtle, with patients complaining that they feel tired or “just not right.” Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is made after plasma glucose testing. The complications of diabetes may already be present by the time patients seek medical attention.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Caused by a combination of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance with no evidence of autoimmunity</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Accounts for 90–95% of cases of DM, with prevalence in the United States of about 9.4%, with considerable variation by ethnic group</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The prevalence in American Indian/Alaska Native persons is 15.1%.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The prevalence in black and Hispanic persons is 12–14%.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  The prevalence in Asian, non-Hispanic persons is 8%, with Asian Indians having the highest prevalence (11.2%).</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  The prevalence in white, non-Hispanic persons is 7.4%.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Diabetes is undiagnosed in 24% of people.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Strong genetic component</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  39% of patients have at least 1 parent with diabetes</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  60–90% concordance in monozygotic twins</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  The lifetime risk of a first-degree relative of a patient with type 2 DM is 5–10 times higher than that of age- and weight-matched individuals without a family history.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  The most important risk factor is obesity, which induces insulin resistance.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The relative risk of diabetes developing in a woman who has a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2 is 93, compared with a woman who has a BMI &lt; 22 kg/m2.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The relative risk of diabetes developing in a man who has a BMI > 35 kg/m2 is 42, compared with a man who has a BMI &lt; 23 kg/m2.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  DKA develops less often in patients with type 2 DM than those with type 1; however, DKA can occur in persons with type 2 DM. Recent data show that two-thirds of patients with DKA have type 1 DM, and one-third have type 2 DM.</p><p>Do not assume all patients with DKA have type 1 DM; DKA can develop in persons with type 2 DM.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Risk factors for type 2 DM include</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Age ≥ 45</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  A first-degree relative with diabetes</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Physical inactivity</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Being a member of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Having delivered a baby weighing > 9 pounds or having had gestational DM</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Hypertension</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol &lt; 35 mg/dL or triglycerides > 250 mg/dL</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  Polycystic ovary syndrome</p><p><strong>10.</strong>  Vascular disease</p><p><strong>11.</strong>  Prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], impaired fasting glucose [IFG], or mildly elevated HbA1c; see Evidence-Based Diagnosis section for definitions)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Patients with either IGT or IFG have a 5–10% annual risk of developing diabetes; those with both have a 10–15% annual risk.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Patients with an HbA1c in the prediabetes range have an annual risk of 10–50% with the risk increasing as the HbA1c increases.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  These annual risks are 10–20 times higher than in people without prediabetes.</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  Screening for diabetes</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening patients beginning at age 45.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Screening should be done at any age in patients with a BMI ≥ 25 (≥ 23 in Asian Americans) and 1 of the additional risk factors listed above.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Screening should be done every 3 years in patients with normal results, and every year in patients with prediabetes.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening adults aged 40–70 years who are overweight or obese (B recommendation).</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Table 12-2 lists the ADA diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes.</p><p><strong>Table 12-2.</strong> American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and diabetes.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  The ADA recommends that all abnormal results be confirmed with repeat testing.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Most physicians screen with either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, or both;

This does not cause glycosuria of a degree sufficient to cause urinary frequency. A urinary tract infection is ruled out by the normal urinalysis. She has increased her water consumption, so excess fluid intake is a likely cause of her symptoms. Bladder dysfunction should be considered if her symptoms do not resolve with the reduction in fluid intake. Diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia are rare diseases that do not need to be considered unless she has a documented urinary output of more than 3 L/day. The next diagnostic test should be reducing her fluid intake.</p><a href=#case-resolution><h3 id=case-resolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>Mrs. D stops forcing herself to drink extra water, and her urination pattern returns to normal.

She reports that she did quite well with her diet and exercise program for several years, maintaining a 10% weight loss. However, over the last couple of years, she has not been able to continue her exercise program or be as careful about her diet because of the stresses of caring for her chronically ill mother as well as working and caring for her own family.

He is taking many medications, including Humulin 70/30 20 units twice daily, metoprolol, aspirin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, furosemide, and ribavirin. Despite all of these problems, he has been slowly improving and reported at his last visit 3 weeks ago that he had recently given up his walker for a cane. Today you are paged by his sister, who reports that Mr. G is very weak and cannot get up; his home glucose monitor reading is “critical high.” Mr. G’s voice is barely recognizable over the phone, and he is unable to respond to your questions. You advise his sister to call 911.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis?

It is helpful to recognize that Mr. G appears to be suffering from the syndrome of delirium and to use the framework for delirium to organize your thinking (see Chapter 11, Delirium and Dementia). It is also reasonable to consider Mr. G’s underlying chronic medical problems as important clinical clues and initially focus on the serious complications of these conditions; in other words, initially focus on diseases for which he has a high pretest probability:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Diabetes: DKA, HHS, infection with or without sepsis.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  CAD: recurrent MI, possibly with heart failure or cardiogenic shock</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Cerebrovascular disease: recurrent stroke</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Chronic hepatitis B: hepatic encephalopathy</p><p>Table 12-11 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 12-11.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. G.</p><p>Mr. G could have any, or a combination, of these conditions. His critical high blood sugar makes a complication of diabetes the leading hypothesis; all of the other diagnoses are “must not miss” hypotheses.</p><p>When Mr. G arrives in the emergency department, he is barely responsive but able to move all 4 extremities. His BP is 85/50 mm Hg; pulse, 120 bpm; RR, 24 breaths per minute; temperature, 37.2°C. His lungs are clear, and cardiac exam shows an S4 with no S3 or murmurs. His abdomen is nontender, and there is no peripheral edema. He has no foot ulcers. Initial laboratory tests include the following:</p><p>Sodium, 140 mEq/L; K, 4.9 mEq/L; Cl, 110 mEq/L; HCO3, 20 mEq/L; BUN, 99 mg/dL; creatinine, 4.3 mg/dL; glucose, 1246 mg/dL.</p><p>Arterial blood gases: pH 7.40; PO2, 88 mm Hg; PCO2, 35 mm Hg.</p><p>WBC is 8400/mcL, with 75% polymorphonuclear neutrophils, 3% bands, 18% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.
