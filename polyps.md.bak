## Pathophysiology & epidemiology (NEJM 2016;374:1065)
* Accumulation of mutations in colonic epithelial cell DNA affecting oncogenes & tumor suppressor genes → tumor initiation (formation of adenoma; APC loss of fxn) → tumor progression (adenoma → carcinoma; K-ras gain of fxn, DCC, p53 loss of fxn)
* Risk factors: ↑ age, FHx (sporadic in 1° relatives, Lynch, FAP), IBD, ↑ dietary fat, central adiposity, ↑ EtOH, ↓ fiber, ↑ red meat, smoking, DM
* Protective factors: ↑ physical activity, ASA/NSAIDs, Ca2+ intake, HRT, ↓ BMI; possibly ↑ fiber, vitamin D, fish oil, statins, selenium
* Neoplastic polyps: adenomas (tubular, villous, tubulovillous dysplasia), sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (concern for interval CRC), carcinomas
* Non-neoplastic polyps: hyperplastic, juvenile, Peutz-Jeghers (can undergo malignant transformation), inflammatory
