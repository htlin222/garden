Sanghani, MD</strong></p><a href=#chief-complaint><h3 id=chief-complaint><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHIEF COMPLAINT</h3></a><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. B is a previously healthy 70-year-old man who underwent right upper lobectomy for localized squamous cell lung cancer 5 days ago. On morning rounds, he comments that he is in a military barracks and that he is ready to go home.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Delirium and dementia are both syndromes of neurologic dysfunction that present as a “change in mental status.” Since the term “altered mental status” can be broad, categorizing the change as chronic or acute and then further classifying acute changes as fluctuating or nonfluctuating may be helpful (Figure 11-1). A patient whose mental status change is acute may have either fluctuating or nonfluctuating symptoms. A patient with acute, fluctuating mental status change is probably delirious. A patient with an acute but stable mental status change may have delirium but may also have a long list of other central nervous system (CNS) insults (head trauma, CNS infection, hypoglycemia, cerebrovascular accident [CVA] among others). Chronic mental change is caused by an irreversible change to the CNS, such as dementia, chronic psychiatric disease, or long-standing CNS injury.</p><p><strong>Figure 11-1.</strong> Schematic of mental status change.</p><p>Delirium and dementia are thus very different syndromes. Delirium is acute, usually reversible, and nearly always has an underlying, non-neurologic etiology. Dementia is chronic and seldom reversible. The definition of delirium from the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,</em> 5e (*DSM-*5) is:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  A disturbance in attention (ie, reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orientation to the environment).</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  The disturbance develops over a short period of time, represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  An additional disturbance in cognition (eg, memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception).</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  There is evidence from the history, physical exam, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies.</p><p>The <em>DSM</em>-5 defines dementia as a major neurocognitive disorder and then defines the many underlying diseases. The definition of a major cognitive disorder is:</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in 1 or more cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has been a significant decline in cognitive function; and</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities (ie, at a minimum, requiring assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs] such as paying bills or managing medications).</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a delirium.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (eg, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).</p><p>Because almost any illness can cause delirium in a susceptible patient, the differential diagnosis of delirium is long and needs to consider a broad range of illnesses, comorbidities, and medication effects. The differential diagnosis of dementia is more finite. Disorders have been listed in order of their approximate prevalence as etiologic factors.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Delirium</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Metabolic</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Dehydration</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Electrolyte abnormalities</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Acidosis or alkalosis</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Liver disease</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Hypoxia or hypercarbia</p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Uncontrolled thyroid disease</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Uremia</p><p><strong>i.</strong>  Thiamine deficiency (Wernicke encephalopathy)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Infectious disease</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  CNS infection</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Systemic infection of any kind</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Cerebrovascular event</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Ischemic stroke</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hemorrhagic stroke</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Vasculitis</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  CNS mass</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Tumor</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Subdural hematoma</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Cardiovascular</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Myocardial infarction</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Heart failure</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Arrhythmia</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Drugs</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Alcohol withdrawal</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Diuretics</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Anticholinergics</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Corticosteroids</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Digoxin</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Opioids</p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Antidepressants</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Anxiolytics</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Miscellaneous</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Fecal impaction</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Urinary retention</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Sensory deprivation</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Severe illness</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Dementia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Alzheimer dementia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Dementia with Lewy bodies</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Vascular dementia</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Frontotemporal dementia</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Alcohol-related</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Uncommon dementias</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Subdural hematoma</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hypothyroidism</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Vitamin B12 deficiency</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Syphilis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Prion disease</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Normal-pressure hydrocephalus</p><p>Almost any illness can cause delirium in a susceptible patient.</p><p>Mr. B’s only medical problem is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His surgery was complicated by transient hypotension and excessive blood loss. He was extubated on postoperative day 3. On postoperative day 4, his wife noted some confusion. The medical team did not detect any abnormalities when they evaluated him.</p><p>Today, postoperative day 5, he is more confused. He is oriented only to person. He is unable to answer any minimally complicated questions.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Based on his history, Mr. B’s acute mental status change appears to fulfill the definition of delirium. He has waxing and waning symptoms, disorientation and inattentiveness. All of these are pivotal points in this case. His postoperative state, recent exposure to sedatives and pain medications (anesthesia), and fluid shifts are all potential causes of delirium. Although Mr. B does not have a history of alcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal is always a possible diagnosis for acute mental status change in the hospital and is a “must not miss” diagnosis. Stroke and seizure, although commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of mental status change, are exceedingly rare causes of delirium. Table 11-1 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 11-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. B.</p><p>On physical exam, Mr. B is lying in bed. He is irritable and agitated. He becomes frustrated during questioning. His vital signs are temperature, 37.0°C; BP, 146/90 mm Hg; pulse, 80 bpm; RR, 18 breaths per minute. General physical exam reveals a healing surgical scar; lung, heart, and abdominal exams are normal. On neurologic exam, his Confusion Assessment Method score is 3 out of 4 (see below). The remainder of the neurologic exam is normal.</p><p>Initial laboratory data, including basic metabolic panel, liver biochemical tests, and urinalysis, are normal.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis? If not, what other information do you need?</strong></p><a href=#leading-hypothesis-delirium><h4 id=leading-hypothesis-delirium><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Leading Hypothesis: Delirium</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation><h5 id=textbook-presentation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Delirium commonly manifests as inattention and confusion. It is usually seen in older patients with severe illness. Clouding of consciousness has classically been used to describe a patient’s symptoms.</p><a href=#disease-highlights><h5 id=disease-highlights><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Almost any illness can lead to delirium in a susceptible patient.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Delirium often complicates medical or surgical hospitalizations.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The most important clues to delirium are the acuity of onset and the fluctuation of course.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Delirium most commonly occurs in older persons and in patients with underlying neurologic disease.</p><p>There is always a cause of delirium. Clinicians must recognize delirium and identify the cause.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Several conditions are more likely to cause delirium than others.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Severe illness</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Drug toxicity</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Fluid and electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and azotemia)</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Infections</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Hypothermia or hyperthermia</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Delirium is very common in sick, hospitalized patients over the age of 65.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  10% of emergency department patients</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  12–25% of medical patients</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  20–50% of surgical patients (highest in patients after hip replacement)</p><p>Most acutely ill, older patients who have an acute deterioration in mental status are suffering from delirium.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  The prognosis of delirium is poor.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Although reliable data is difficult to obtain, delirium is a predictor of poor outcomes.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Meta-analysis shows that, after controlling for age, sex, comorbid illness or illness severity, and baseline dementia, patients who experienced delirium had a higher risk of death, institutionalization, and dementia during follow-up.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The mortality rate, over about 2 years, for patients in whom delirium developed was 38%.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  The rate of institutionalization, over about a year, was 33.4%.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  The rate of developing dementia over the next 4 years was 62.5%.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  In this same study, patients with dementia and delirium had the highest risk of death.</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  Delirium is often persistent. Many studies show that most patients in whom delirium develops have at least some persistent symptoms at discharge. These symptoms may be present for months.</p><p>Only a small percentage of patients with delirium have complete resolution of symptoms with treatment of the underlying disease and return home.</p><p><strong>I.</strong>  Delirium can occasionally “unmask” underlying dementia.

He has lost the ability to do a higher-level task. Given the patient’s advanced age, dementia—most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD)—has to be included in the differential diagnosis of his cognitive decline. The subacute onset of this patient’s symptoms makes AD the leading hypothesis. Another common cause of dementia in older persons is vascular dementia (VaD). It will be important to determine whether this patient has risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. In an older person, clinicians should also consider the normal cognitive decline that comes with aging. However, this never causes functional compromise. An alternative diagnosis is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a syndrome of memory loss more severe than normal, age-related cognitive decline. MCI also does not cause functional impairment. Delirium and depression should always be considered in an older patient with cognitive decline because they are highly treatable.

Some of these are included below:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Aphasia</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Apraxia</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Agnosia</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Impaired ADLs and altered patterns of behavior</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Family history of dementia</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Normal lumbar puncture, normal or nonspecific EEG findings, and cerebral atrophy on neuroimaging</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Because these criteria are not perfect in the diagnosis of AD, patients in whom dementia or AD is suspected but who do not meet the criteria should be monitored closely or referred for more detailed neuropsychiatric testing.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Reversible dementias</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  An important issue when diagnosing AD is how much more of a workup should be done? The concern is that when making a clinical diagnosis, potentially reversible dementias might be missed. These reversible dementias include:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  CNS infections</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hypothyroidism</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Vitamin B12 deficiency</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  CNS masses</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Neoplasms</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Subdural hematomas</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Normal-pressure hydrocephalus</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Medications</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Current practice is to order the following tests:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  CBC</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Basic metabolic panel and liver biochemical tests</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Vitamin B12 level</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Tests to exclude neurosyphilis</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Consider neuroimaging (MRI or CT)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Imaging is not required in most patients with dementia.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  In practice, most patients will undergo imaging both to assess for diagnoses other than AD and to detect brain atrophy that may support the diagnosis of AD.</p><a href=#treatment-2><h5 id=treatment-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Counseling</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  When the diagnosis of AD is made, patients and families should be educated on course, complications, and prognosis of the disease.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Decisions need to be made regarding health care proxies, financial and estate planning, and end-of-life care.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  It is crucial to make these decisions while the patient is still a competent decision maker. Referral to support services, such as the Alzheimer’s Association, may be helpful.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) is a validated tool helpful for identifying, tracking, and monitoring functional decline. It is especially helpful to guide conversations about initiating hospice care.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Safety</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  As dementia progresses, patient safety often becomes an issue.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Driving, wandering, and cooking are often early concerns.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Driving is usually the most difficult to address because patients lack insight into the dangers they pose and resist the loss of independence that not driving brings.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Physicians should raise this issue, since it is often difficult for caregivers to bring up.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Patients with even mild dementia should either be told to not drive or be required to undergo frequent performance evaluations.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Home safety checklists are available online that can help family members protect patients with dementia.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Behavioral</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Caregivers should be told to expect behavioral and personality changes and be instructed on how to respond.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Maintenance of routines is important.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Situations likely to be stressful to patients, such as those in which a patient’s deficits interfere with his functioning, should be avoided.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Pharmacotherapy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Cholinesterase inhibitors</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  4 cholinesterase inhibitors are approved for treatment</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Donepezil</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Tacrine</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Rivastigmine</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Galantamine</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  These medications have been shown to have modest effects on objective measures of dementia and functional status.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist also approved for the treatment of AD. It has similar efficacy to the drugs above and may be used in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Associated neuropsychiatric symptoms</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  May include agitation (60–70%) or either delusions or hallucinations (30–60%)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine and risperidone, are frequently used but the evidence base for their efficacy is poor and they are associated with higher mortality. Neither of these drugs is approved for this indication.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Depression</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Very common in patients with AD</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Present in up to 50% of patients</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  All patients with AD should be screened for depression and treated if it is found.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Caregiver support</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Taking care of a friend or relative with AD is challenging.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Caregivers should be counseled on the importance of taking time off and the availability of respite care.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  They should be counseled that behavioral difficulties are a result of the disease and not the patient’s anger or heartlessness.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Caregiver support groups can be extremely helpful.</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis-1><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mr. R’s exam thus far reveals some difficulty with recalling recent events. Given his age, his baseline risk of dementia is at least 10%. The first step in his workup would be to perform a screening tests for dementia. If this is positive, consider whether he fulfills the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD.</p><p>Further history revealed that the patient’s wife had taken over bookkeeping because a few bills had gone unpaid during the last 3 months.</p><p>The patient was given the Mini-Cog and scored 2 out of 5. Consideration of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria showed him to have dementia with deficits in 2 or more areas of cognition (orientation, visuospatial and executive functioning, attention and working memory, and memory). At the time of the visit, it was not clear whether his cognitive functioning was worsening, and there were no disturbances in consciousness.</p><p>The plan was made for initial laboratory work to be done and for a 3-month follow-up visit. Given that he was taking multiple psychoactive medications, his regimen was scaled back to the minimum doses necessary to control his pain.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, AD?

He was able to wean his medications and felt like he had a little more energy. On a follow-up visit 3 months later, the patient’s wife reported that he was no longer driving to his job because it had become too difficult. On physical exam, his language skills had worsened, and he frequently answered questions with short affirmative phrases and nods that were often contradicted by his wife. (He would subsequently agree with her.) A CT scan with contrast was ordered and showed only cerebral atrophy.</p><p>AD can be confidently diagnosed in this patient. He has no risk factors for VaD. His ischemia score is one. Dementia was diagnosed at his previous visit; since his symptoms have progressed, he now fulfills the criteria for AD. Reversible causes of dementia are unlikely given the normal evaluation. The patient’s functional limitations exclude MCI as a cause.
