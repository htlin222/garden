# adrenal incidentalomas

Epidemiology
* 4% of Pts undergoing abdominal CT scan have incidentally discovered adrenal mass; prevalence ↑ with age
Differential diagnosis
* Nonfunctioning mass: adenoma, cysts, abscesses, granuloma, hemorrhage, lipoma, myelolipoma, primary or metastatic malignancy
* Functioning mass: pheochromocytoma, adenoma (cortisol, aldosterone, sex hormones), other endocrine tumor, carcinoma
Hormonal workup (EJE 2016;175:G1; NEJM 2021;384:1542)
* Rule out subclinical Cushing’s syndrome in all Pts using 1 mg overnight DST (Sp 91%). Abnormal results require confirmatory testing.
* Rule out hyperaldosteronism if hypertensive w/ plasma aldo & renin (see above)
* Rule out pheochromocytoma in ALL Pts (b/c of morbidity unRx’d pheo) using 24-h urine fractionated metanephrines or plasma fractionated metanephrines
[[Malignancy workup-adrenal incidentalomas]]
Follow-up
* If hormonal workup ⊖ and appearance benign, no further follow-up imaging needed, but controversial (Annals 2019;171:107)
