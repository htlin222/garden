Associated factors include  hypothalamic/pituitary radiation, ovarian/uterine radiation, and treatment with an alkylating agent, lomustine, or cyclophosphamide. Female cancer survivors have also been reported to have 10-fold greater risk of nonsurgical premature menopause than siblings without cancer.</p><p>Risk of infertility is dependent on several factors, including type and stage of cancer; drug class and cumulative dose; radiation dose, site and number of treatments; extent of surgical therapy; and age, gender, and genetic factors. Fertility impairment can be temporary or permanent, depending on the diagnosis, stage of disease, and treatment site.</p><p>Drugs used for endocrine therapy (e.g., for breast cancer) can also be cytotoxic. The following algorithm describes techniques to preserve fertility and a framework for managing concerns in young women with breast cancer:</p><a href=#treatment-guidelines-for-the-preservation-of-fertility-in-young-women-with-breast-cancer><h3 id=treatment-guidelines-for-the-preservation-of-fertility-in-young-women-with-breast-cancer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment Guidelines for the Preservation of Fertility in Young Women with Breast Cancer</h3></a><p><strong>(Source: Preservation of Fertility in Patients with Cancer. N Engl J Med 2009.)</strong></p><a href=#secondary-malignancy><h3 id=secondary-malignancy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Secondary Malignancy</h3></a><p>Survivors of childhood and adult-onset malignancies can experience secondary malignancies caused by cancer treatment as well as genetic and environmental factors. Some chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy for some cancers, stem-cell transplantation, and combination treatment with radiation and chemotherapy are associated with the development of secondary cancer.</p><a href=#chemotherapy-classes-and-specific-toxicities><h2 id=chemotherapy-classes-and-specific-toxicities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chemotherapy Classes and Specific Toxicities</h2></a><p>Different classes of chemotherapy are associated with specific side effects during the course of treatment. Some examples include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Taxane-based chemotherapy and other microtubule-inhibitor therapies</strong> are associated with peripheral neuropathy. For many patients, symptoms of peripheral neuropathy will improve after treatment cessation. For others, symptoms may persist and cause long-term problems with mobility and function. No consensus exists on management or prevention of peripheral neuropathy. However, recognition of the symptoms and dose adjustment may help symptom management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anthracyclines and bleomycin-based regimens</strong> are associated with shortness of breath (the former can cause cardiac dysfunction and the latter can lead to pulmonary fibrosis).</p></li><li><p><strong>Regimens containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine</strong> are commonly associated with severe diarrhea and vomiting. In patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, treatment with 5-FU can lead to severe nausea, vomiting, or even death.</p></li></ul><a href=#chemotherapy-classes-and-specific-toxicities-1><h3 id=chemotherapy-classes-and-specific-toxicities-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chemotherapy Classes and Specific Toxicities</h3></a><table><thead><tr><th>Class (examples)</th><th>Toxicities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alkylating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, busulfan)</td><td>Hemorrhagic cystitis, encephalopathy associated with ifosfamide administration (worsened with low albumin levels)</td></tr><tr><td>Cytotoxic antibiotic (bleomycin)</td><td>Pulmonary fibrosis, hyperpigmentation, dermatographism, fever (during infusion)</td></tr><tr><td>Antimetabolites (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, methotrexate, cytarabine)</td><td>Diarrhea, mucositis, hand–foot syndrome, coronary artery spasm</td></tr><tr><td>Anthracyclines (epirubicin, doxorubicin)</td><td>Cardiovascular toxicity (see table below)</td></tr><tr><td>Vinca alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine)</td><td>Peripheral neuropathy</td></tr><tr><td>Taxanes (paclitaxel)</td><td>Peripheral neuropathy, joint pain</td></tr><tr><td>Platinum-based (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin)</td><td>Renal dysfunction</td></tr><tr><td>Topoisomerase inhibitors (etoposide, topotecan)</td><td>Asthenia, stomatitis, diarrhea </td></tr></tbody></table><a href=#radiotherapy-toxicity><h2 id=radiotherapy-toxicity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Radiotherapy Toxicity</h2></a><p>Radiotherapy is used in both curative- and palliative-care settings, and associated toxicities vary.

Radiotherapy is thought to contribute to about 5% of the total treatment-related secondary malignancies.</p><ul><li><p>Immediate toxicity may include skin changes at the radiation site, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, depending on the location of radiotherapy.</p></li><li><p>Radiotherapy to the brain can result in nausea, cognitive impairment (long-term and temporary), and alopecia.</p></li><li><p>Pediatric and young-adult cancer patients can experience infertility as ovaries and testicles are sensitive to the effects of radiation.</p></li></ul><a href=#biological-effects-and-normal-tissue-toxicity-after-radiotherapy><h3 id=biological-effects-and-normal-tissue-toxicity-after-radiotherapy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Biological Effects and Normal Tissue Toxicity After Radiotherapy</h3></a><p><strong>(Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Reviews Cancer. The Tumour Microenvironment After Radiotherapy: Mechanisms of Resistance and Recurrence, copyright 2015.)</strong></p><a href=#targeted-therapy-toxicity><h2 id=targeted-therapy-toxicity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Targeted-Therapy Toxicity</h2></a><p><strong>Antibody therapy:</strong> Although conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy have had some success in attacking malignant cells, the ability to selectively target tumor cells is limited. Advances in drug design have attempted to circumvent this issue by development of drugs through use of monoclonal antibodies.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Monoclonal antibodies</strong> (e.g., rituximab, trastuzumab, and cetuximab) have been included in regimens for many types of cancer, ranging from breast cancer to lymphomas and colorectal cancer.</p><ul><li><p>Patients may have allergic reactions during an infusion with monoclonal antibodies. Management guidelines vary by institution, but antihistamines, glucocorticoids, and fluids can be started depending on the severity of these reactions.</p></li><li><p>Some monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab) can cause long-term changes in immunoglobulin levels that lead to an increased risk of infections.</p></li><li><p>Some monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab) can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by hypothermia or fever, hypotension, rash, and multiple organ dysfunction.</p></li><li><p>Trastuzumab can be associated with heart failure during treatment. Therefore, regular echocardiograms should be requested. Patients with a history of trastuzumab exposure may develop long-term cardiac dysfunction.</p></li><li><p>Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic monoclonal antibody associated with high blood pressure, venous thromboembolism, and bleeding.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</strong> (e.g., erlotinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib) are CYP3A4 substrates that can interact with other drugs, and some interactions can lead to reduced drug efficacy (something to consider when prescribing).</p><ul><li><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also associated with dermatological changes that may require intervention with glucocorticoid or antibiotic creams.</p></li><li><p>Some drugs in this class (e.g., sorafenib and sunitinib) that target multiple receptors can lead to hypertension and diarrhea.</p></li><li><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can also affect thyroid function.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors</strong> (e.g., everolimus, temsirolimus):</p><ul><li><p>The most common toxic effects are mucositis and skin toxicity.</p></li><li><p>Other toxicities include diarrhea, nausea, and loss of appetite.</p></li><li><p>Patients may also experience short-term shortness of breath caused by pulmonary fibrosis.</p></li></ul><p>Cardiovascular toxicities associated with targeted cancer therapies are summarized in the following table:</p><p><strong>(Source: Cardiovascular Toxic Effects of Targeted Cancer Therapies.

Given the unparalleled ability of immune cells to recognize antigens displayed on the surface of pathogens, researchers are increasingly interested in finding ways to harness the body’s own ability to attack tumor cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) therapy are two examples.</p><p><strong>CAR</strong> <strong>T-cell therapy:</strong> CAR T-cell therapy employs an individual’s own genetically engineered cytotoxic T cells to attack malignant tumor cells. Currently this modality is primarily used for hematologic malignancies (most often B-cell malignancies) and has changed the management of relapsed and refractory cancers. CAR T-cell therapy is also being studied for treatment of solid-tumor malignancies.</p><p><strong>Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) therapy</strong>**:** BiTE therapy uses endogenous T cells to attack antigens expressed on malignant cells to eliminate cancer. Unlike CAR T-cell therapy, this modality eliminates the need to create genetically altered T cells and the issues that come with that (ex vivo expansion and manipulation).</p><ul><li><p>BiTE molecules consist of two binding domains:</p></li><li><ul><li><p>One recognizes tumor-expressed antigen (e.g., CD19).</p></li><li><p>Another recognizes CD3 on cytotoxic T cells.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When a BiTE molecule engages both a cytotoxic T cell and a tumor cell, the T cells begin proliferating and subsequently malignant lysis occurs.</p></li><li><p>Blinatumomab was the first approved BiTE-molecule therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); it targets CD19 surface antigens on B cells. Additional BiTE molecules in development target other hematologic malignancies (e.g., multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and solid tumors (e.g., prostate cancer, glioblastoma, gastric cancer, and small-cell lung cancer).</p></li></ul><a href=#mechanism-of-action-for-bispecific-t-cell-engager-bite><h3 id=mechanism-of-action-for-bispecific-t-cell-engager-bite><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mechanism of Action for Bispecific T-Cell Engager (BiTE)</h3></a><p><strong>(Source: The BiTE (Bispecific T-cell Engager) Platform: Development and Future Potential of a Targeted Immuno-oncology Therapy Across Tumor Types. Cancer 2020.)</strong></p><p>**(Source: CAR-T Cells and BiTEs in Solid Tumors: Challenges and Perspectives. J Hematol Oncol 2021.)**<strong>Challenges and Toxicity</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Tumor-antigen specificity:</strong> Some challenges faced by both BiTE therapy and CAR T-cell therapy include the development of tumor-antigen specificity. Many antigens found in solid tumors lack specificity and are often found at low levels in normal tissue, thereby limiting their use to this disease group. In addition, heterogenous expression of the target antigen (e.g., between different regions of a tumor) may limit the efficacy of these novel therapies. Also of note, many solid tumors have harsher tumor microenvironments, which can render these therapies dysfunctional.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cytokine release syndrome:</strong> CRS is a rapid immune reaction that develops soon after administration of the agent and activates the massive release of cytokines (e.g., interferon gamma [IFN-γ] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) from targeting cancer cells, leading to a life-threatening range of neurotoxic and pneumotoxic symptoms. Vasodilation with capillary leak and edema can result in severe fluid refractory shock that requires vasoactive support to maintain organ perfusion.</p><ul><li><p>Clinical and laboratory manifestations of CRS are similar to manifestations of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome, including cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, coagulopathy, and hyperferritinemia.</p></li><li><p>Symptoms of CRS include hypothermia or fever, hypotension, rash, and multiple organ dysfunctio In patients with signs and symptoms of potential CRS (e.g., fever), close observation of fever and inflammatory markers is warranted, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin. Mild-to-moderate CRS symptoms can spontaneously resolve with supportive care (e.g., antipyretics and intravenous fluids). Refractory hypotension necessitates admission to an intensive care unit and treatment with vasoactives and cytokine blockade with tocilizumab. If patients do not improve on tocilizumab, treatment with escalating intravenous methylprednisolone therapy is warranted. In refractory cases, immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclophosphamide) might be of benefit.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><a href=/inbox rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/inbox>inbox</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>↩️ 反向連結</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/all-list-of-resident360/ data-ctx="Oncology - Treatment Toxicities - Fast Facts  NEJM Resident 360" data-src=/all-list-of-resident360 class=internal-link>all list of resident360</a></li><li><a href=/onco/ data-ctx="Oncology - Treatment Toxicities - Fast Facts  NEJM Resident 360" data-src=/onco class=internal-link>oncology</a></li><li><a href=/onco-2/ data-ctx="Oncology - Treatment Toxicities - Fast Facts  NEJM Resident 360" data-src=/onco-2 class=internal-link>oncology</a></li><li><a href=/oncology/ data-ctx="Oncology - Treatment Toxicities - Fast Facts  NEJM Resident 360" data-src=/oncology class=internal-link>oncology</a></li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>🤯互動圖</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://www.physician.tw/js/graph.2d9e48dbe7ea47c0ef1c58296ce14448.js></script></div></div><div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//physician.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>本網站是由 Hsieh-Ting Lin 以❤️ 用 <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>這個酷東西種出來🪴 , © 2023</p><p><a href=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/htl.lizard><img src=https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png width=200></a></p><ul><li><a href=https://www.physician.tw/>🏠首頁</a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com/Tim.H.Lin>Facebook</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/htlin222>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/htlin222>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://htlin.site>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://medium.com/@hsieh-ting-lin>Medium</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
