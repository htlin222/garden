How do I determine which screening tests to order?</h2></a><p><strong>Diane Altkorn, MD, & Elizabeth Schulwolf, MD, MA</strong></p><p><strong>PATIENT</strong></p><p>Mr. S is a healthy 45-year-old white man who wants to be “checked for everything.”</p><p><strong>How do you know when it is worthwhile to screen for a disease? Where do you find information on screening guidelines? How do you interpret screening guidelines?</strong></p><p>It seems intuitive that it is best to prevent a disease from occurring at all and next best to diagnose and treat it early. However, there are risks and benefits to every intervention, and it is especially important to make sure an intervention is not going to harm a healthy individual. This chapter focuses on understanding the reasoning behind current screening practices.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Screening can be used to identify an unrecognized disease or risk factor in a seemingly well person.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Screening can be accomplished by collecting a thorough history, performing a physical examination, or obtaining laboratory tests.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Examples of screening include mammography and cholesterol testing.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Mammography can detect unrecognized, asymptomatic breast cancer.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Cholesterol testing can be used</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  To identify high-risk individuals who do not yet have coronary disease (called primary prevention by clinicians).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  To prevent complications in patients with known coronary disease (called secondary prevention by clinicians, not actually screening).</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The following criteria are helpful in determining whether screening for a disease is worthwhile:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The burden of disease must be sufficient to warrant screening.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Screen only for conditions that cause severe disease, disability, or death.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Consider prevalence of target disease and ability to identify high-risk group, since the yield of screening is higher in high-risk groups.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The test used for screening must be of high quality.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Screening tests should accurately detect the target disease when it is asymptomatic.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Screening tests should have high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Test results should be reproducible in a variety of settings.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Screening tests must be safe and acceptable to patients.</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Ideally, screening tests should be simple and shown to be cost effective.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  There should be evidence that screening reduces morbidity or mortality.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  There must be effective treatment for the target disease.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Early detection followed by treatment must improve survival compared with detection and treatment at the usual time of presentation; in other words, people in whom the condition was diagnosed by screening should have better health outcomes than those in whom the condition was diagnosed clinically.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  The benefits of screening must outweigh any adverse effects of the screening test, treatment, or impact of early diagnosis.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Ideally, benefits and harms are evaluated through a randomized trial of screening (Figure 2-1).</p><p><strong>Figure 2-1.</strong> Design for a randomized trial of screening.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  The best outcome to measure is either all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality, such as breast cancer or prostate cancer mortality.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Outcomes such as cancer stage distribution (ie, whether there are more or fewer early-stage cancers found) and length of survival after diagnosis can be misleading because of lead time and length time biases.</p><p><strong>(a)</strong>  Lead time bias: If early treatment is not more effective than later treatment, the duration of time the individual lives with the disease is longer, but the mortality rate is the same (Figure 2-2).</p><p><strong>Figure 2-2.</strong> Lead time bias. (The total survival times for the unscreened patient and the screened patient in whom early treatment is not effective are the same. The total survival time for the screened patient in whom early treatment is effective is lengthened.)</p><p><strong>(b)</strong>  Length time bias: Cancers that progress rapidly from onset to symptoms are less likely to be detected by screening than slow-growing cancers, so that screening tends to identify a group with a better prognosis.</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Often, screening decisions are made based on less direct evidence, such as cohort or case-control studies. Given the biases inherent in these study designs, this is suboptimal and has led to the institution of screening programs that provide no benefit.</p><p><strong>Where do you find information on screening guidelines?</strong></p><p>Because of the complexity and rapid evolution of the evidence underlying screening recommendations, most physicians rely on published guidelines to inform them about screening decisions. Guidelines are developed and updated by a variety of organizations. It is important to be familiar with different sources of guidelines and to understand how to access the most recent versions of guidelines.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Web site:
<a href=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/ rel=noopener>http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong>  An independent panel of experts in primary care and prevention, now under the aegis of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Supported by outside experts, several evidence-based practice centers, and university centers that help identify high-priority topics, produce systematic reviews, and draft guidelines.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  USPSTF guidelines often form the basis of clinical guidelines developed by professional societies.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Highly evidence-based recommendations on when and how to screen</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Professional/specialty societies</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Often do their own independent reviews and issue their own guidelines regarding relevant diseases</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Specific guidelines generally available through the society website</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Examples include</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Specialty societies (eg, American College of Physicians [internal medicine], American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American College of Surgery)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Subspecialty societies (eg, American Thoracic Society, American College of Rheumatology, American Urologic Association, American College of Gastroenterology, American College of Cardiology)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Others (eg, American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, National Osteoporosis Foundation, American Heart Association)</p><p><strong>How do you interpret screening guidelines?</strong></p><p>The USPSTF has developed a standardized system and vocabulary for evaluating the quality of the evidence addressing screening questions and for grading recommendations. The recommendation grade is based on a combination of the quality of the underlying evidence and an assessment of the size of the benefit. This general approach is often adopted by other organizations that make screening recommendations.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  USPSTF levels of certainty regarding net benefit (net benefit = benefit – harm as implemented in a primary care population)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  High: Consistent results from well-designed studies in representative primary care populations that assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes; it is unlikely that these conclusions will change based on future studies.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Moderate: Evidence sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but methodologic issues such as limited generalizability, inconsistent findings, or inadequate size or number of studies exist; these conclusions could change based on future studies.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Low: Insufficient evidence to assess effects on health outcomes, due to limited number or size of studies, flaws in study designs, inconsistency of findings, lack of generalizability.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Grades of recommendations</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Grade A: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Grade B: The USPSTF recommends this service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Grade C: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Grade D: The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Grade I statement: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.</p><p>Mr. S feels fine and has no medical history. He takes no medications, does not smoke currently, and drinks occasionally. However, he did smoke occasionally in college, and he estimates he smoked a total of 2–3 packs of cigarettes over 4 years. He exercises regularly by cycling 50–100 miles/week. His family history is notable for high cholesterol, hypertension, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in his father; his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 54. His physical exam shows a BP of 120/80 mm Hg and pulse of 56 bpm. His body mass index (BMI) is 22 kg/m2. HEENT, neck, cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and extremity exams are normal. He refuses a rectal exam. Mr. S shows you a list of tests he wants done, derived from research he has done on the Internet: lipid panel, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), chest radiograph, and fecal occult blood test (FOBT). In addition, he shows you a letter from a company offering “vascular screening” with ultrasounds of the carotids and aorta and wants to know if he should have those tests done.</p><p><strong>Should Mr. S be screened for prostate cancer with a PSA?</strong></p><a href=#prostate-cancer-screening><h4 id=prostate-cancer-screening><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prostate Cancer Screening</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  What is the burden of disease?</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  161,360 new diagnoses of prostate cancer in 2017, with approximately 26,730 deaths</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis is about 11.0%;
