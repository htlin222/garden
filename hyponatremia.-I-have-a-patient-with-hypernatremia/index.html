Shortly after arrival he has a generalized seizure. Initial labs reveal a serum sodium concentration of 122 mEq/L.</p><p><strong>What are the symptoms of hyponatremia? What is the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h4 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h4></a><p>As noted in Chapter 1, the first task when evaluating patients is to identify their problem(s). Mr. P’s problems clearly include seizure, marked hyponatremia, and inability to urinate. While other causes of seizures must be considered, the hyponatremia clearly requires evaluation because it is severe, potentially life-threatening, and likely to have caused the seizure.</p><p>Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients and associated with an increase in mortality that is profoundly modified by the underlying cause of hyponatremia. It is defined as a serum sodium concentration &lt; 135 mEq/L and is classified as mild (130–135 mmol/L), moderate (125–129 mmol/L), or profound (&lt; 125 mmol/L).</p><a href=#symptoms-of-hyponatremia><h4 id=symptoms-of-hyponatremia><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Symptoms of Hyponatremia</h4></a><p>The adverse effects and manifestations of hyponatremia depend on its severity and rapidity of development. Acute hyponatremia (defined as developing within the prior 48 h) leaves the brain hypertonic relative to the hypotonic serum. This osmotic gradient drives water into the brain’s astrocytes, resulting in cerebral edema and CNS symptoms. <em>Acute</em> hyponatremia may cause seizures, brain damage, brainstem herniation, respiratory arrest, rhabdomyolysis and death. Symptoms occur at much more modest degrees of hyponatremia than in patients with chronic hyponatremia. Seizures can occur even at sodium levels above 120 mEq/L. On the other hand, in chronic hyponatremia (most cases), CNS adaptations occur. Astrocytes decrease their intracellular osmolality, decreasing the osmotic flux of water into the brain in turn causing less cerebral edema. Therefore, symptoms tend to develop when hyponatremia is more severe than in patients with acute hyponatremia. Seizures and herniation are much less frequent. Typically, patients with chronic hyponatremia and serum sodium levels > 130 mEq/L are asymptomatic. Symptoms associated with profound hyponatremia (&lt; 125 mEq/L) include nausea (44–49%), vomiting (27–30%), gait disturbance (31%), headache 27%, confusion (14–30%), seizures (5%), and coma.</p><p>Before reviewing the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, it is useful to briefly review the pathophysiology of normal water handling, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and then hyponatremia. ADH plays a key role in water handling.</p><p>In health, dehydration increases the serum sodium and osmolality and triggers ADH release. This causes water channels (aquaporins) to be inserted into the luminal membrane of the collecting ducts, promoting water reabsorption. This restores normal osmolality and sodium concentration. Conversely, excessive water ingestion lowers the serum sodium and osmolality suppressing ADH secretion and results in the removal of the aquaporins. This prevents water reabsorption, promotes its excretion and restores the normal osmolality and sodium concentration.</p><p><em>Hyponatremia</em> occurs when water accumulates in excess of sodium due to an inability to excrete ingested water and in <em>most</em> patients, develops due to an excess of ADH. The excessive ADH release causes persistent, sustained, and inappropriate water reabsorption, diluting the serum sodium (and also simultaneously concentrating the urine). In order to understand the states of increased ADH it is critical to appreciate the triggers of ADH release. ADH is obviously released in response to an increase in osmolality but is also secreted in response to critical hypovolemia (in an attempt to reabsorb water and volume). The hypovolemia can be either real hypovolemia (as in hemorrhagic shock) or <em>perceived</em> hypovolemia, such as when there is an ineffective circulating volume (eg, from severe heart failure [HF]). In addition to these <em>appropriate</em> causes of ADH release, ADH secretion may be <em>inappropriate</em>, causing the syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). In SIADH, tumors and other diseases cause the release of ADH that is triggered by neither an increase in osmolality nor a decrease in the effective circulating volume. Finally, hyponatremia develops in some patients despite an appropriate suppression of ADH due to the rapid ingestion of such excessive amounts of water that they are unable to excrete it. This is referred to as water intoxication.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for hyponatremia is long, but the diagnostic approach can be easily framed in a few simple steps. These pivotal steps include (1) a quick search for highly diagnostic clues; (2) a clinical assessment of the patient’s volume status to limit the differential; (3) in clinically euvolemic patients, a review of their urine sodium to detect subtle hypovolemia, and finally, (4) evaluate truly euvolemic patients for hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency prior to diagnosing SIADH. Each of these steps is discussed below.</p><p>The first step recognizes that a few key clinical and laboratory features immediately suggest very specific diagnoses (Figure 24-1). Examples of these include marked hyperglycemia suggesting hyperglycemic-induced hyponatremia, thiazide use (suggesting diuretic-induced hyponatremia), recent participation in marathon events 406(suggesting exercise-associated hyponatremia [EAH]), hyperkalemia (suggesting kidney failure or primary adrenal insufficiency), very low urine osmolality (suggesting water intoxication from either psychogenic polydipsia, Ecstasy use, or beer potomania), normal serum osmolality (suggesting pseudohyponatremia) or recent attendance at a party, rave etc. (suggesting possible Ecstasy use).</p><p><strong>Figure 24-1.</strong> Step 1: Look for highly suggestive diagnostic clues.</p><p>For many patients, the previously mentioned clues are absent and the second pivotal step evaluates the patient’s <em>clinical</em> volume status in order to determine whether they are clinically hypervolemic, hypovolemic, or euvolemic. This allows the differential diagnosis to be narrowed to that appropriate subset of diagnoses (Figure 24-2). Correct classification of the patient’s volume status requires a review of their history, physical exam findings, and laboratory results. The clinical recognition of <em>hypervolemic patients</em> is usually straightforward because hyponatremia typically develops in patients with advanced HF, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney failure when the disease is easily recognized. Conversely, hypotension or orthostasis suggests hypovolemia. Patients who are neither hypervolemic nor hypovolemic are classified as <em>clinically</em> euvolemic.</p><p><strong>Figure 24-2.</strong> Step 2: Determine the patients clinical volume status.</p><p>The third pivotal step evaluates patients who appear <em>clinically</em> euvolemic. Surprisingly, some patients who appear clinically euvolemic are, in fact, hypovolemic. Here, the measurement of the urine sodium can be helpful. Since hypovolemia promotes avid sodium reabsorption within the kidney, hypovolemia is usually associated with a low urinary sodium concentration (&lt; 20–30 mEq/L). On the other hand, euvolemic patients do not have a stimulus to reabsorb urine sodium and usually have a higher urinary sodium (> 20–30 mEq/L). Therefore, a low urine sodium in such patients confirms hypovolemia and an elevated urine sodium confirms euvolemia (Figure 24-3).</p><p><strong>Figure 24-3.</strong> Step 3: Evaluate clinical euvolemia to distinguish true euvolemia from subtle hypovolemia.</p><p>There are a few exceptions that should be kept in mind when interpreting the urinary sodium in patients who appear clinically euvolemic.</p><p>First, several hypovolemic conditions are associated with an <em>increased</em> urinary sodium loss, which can be misleading. <em>Diuretics</em> can force urinary sodium excretion despite hypovolemia. Therefore, while a low urinary sodium in a patient taking diuretics still suggests hypovolemia, an elevated urine sodium cannot be interpreted. <em>Hypoaldosteronism</em> impairs sodium reabsorption and causes both hypovolemia and increased urinary sodium losses.</p><p>Second, several euvolemic states may be associated with <em>low</em> urinary sodium concentrations. Patients with SIADH may ingest little sodium and occasionally have a low urinary sodium measurement (despite euvolemia). Patients with water intoxication (due to psychogenic polydipsia, Ecstasy use, or EAH) may also have a low urinary sodium concentration because the massive water ingestion (and excretion) dilutes the excreted sodium and lowers its concentration. These will usually be identified in the first pivotal step by finding a maximally dilute urine (urine osmolality &lt; 100 mOsm/L).</p><p>The final pivotal step evaluates these truly euvolemic hyponatremic patients. Most such patients have SIADH. However, before making this diagnosis, severe hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency must be ruled out (Figure 24-4).</p><p><strong>Figure 24-4.</strong> Step 4: Evaluate euvolemic patients to distinguish SIADH from other diagnoses.</p><p>It is important to mention a few potential pitfalls. First, the urine sodium should <em>not</em> be measured in clinically <em>hypervolemic</em> patients. Hypervolemia in such patients is associated with an <em>ineffective circulating volume</em>, which triggers not only ADH release but also promotes avid sodium reabsorption, thereby lowering their urinary sodium. This finding could mislead clinicians into misclassifying these patients as hypovolemic.</p><p>Second, a response to a saline challenge is occasionally diagnostically helpful but potentially dangerous. In hypovolemic hyponatremic patients, ADH secretion is triggered by the hypovolemia. The saline challenge can restore the intravascular volume, suppress ADH secretion, and promote a brisk water diuresis. This may cause a dangerously rapid rise in the serum sodium putting patients at risk for developing the osmotic demyelinization syndrome, a severe life-threatening complication of therapy (see below). On the other hand, the opposite can happen in patients with SIADH. In SIADH, ADH secretion continues despite the sodium challenge. This causes the water from the saline to be retained, whereas the sodium is excreted. This can cause a paradoxical <em>fall</em> in the serum sodium from the normal saline challenge, which can worsen CNS symptoms. Consultation is advised.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of hyponatremia classified by volume status is listed below.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-hyponatremia><h5 id=differential-diagnosis-of-hyponatremia><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Differential Diagnosis of Hyponatremia</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Hypervolemia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  HF</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Cirrhosis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Nephrotic syndrome</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Kidney failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt; 5 mL/min)</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Euvolemia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Thiazide diuretics</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  SIADH</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Cancers (eg, pancreas, lung)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  CNS disease (eg, cerebrovascular accident, trauma, infection, hemorrhage, mass)</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Pulmonary diseases (eg, infections, respiratory failure)</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Drugs</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  ADH analogs (vasopressin, desmopressin acetate [DDAVP], oxytocin)</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Chlorpropamide (6–7% of treated patients)</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Carbamazepine</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Antidepressants (tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and antipsychotics</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</p><p><strong>(6)</strong>  Ecstasy (MDMA)</p><p><strong>(7)</strong>  Others (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, nicotine, opioids, clofibrate)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Hypothyroidism, severe</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Psychogenic polydipsia</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Secondary adrenal insufficiency</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  EAH</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Beer potomania</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Hypovolemia</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Thiazide diuretics</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Salt and water loss with free water replacement (ie, vomiting or diarrhea)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Primary adrenal insufficiency</p><p>Due to Mr. P.’s seizure and subsequent postictal state, Mr. P cannot give a medical history.

His normal potassium does not suggest adrenal insufficiency and his low serum osmolality confirms hypotonic hyponatremia ruling out pseudohyponatremia. However, his urine osmolality is exceptionally low and is a pivotal clue. Since ADH (whether appropriate or inappropriate) promotes water reabsorption from the urine, it also acts to increase the urine osmolality. His maximally dilute urine (&lt; 100 mOsm) suggests that ADH is actually suppressed and that the hyponatremia is due to a different mechanism, specifically some form of water intoxication. Causes of water intoxication include psychogenic polydipsia, recent marathon, beer potomania, or Ecstasy use. Given his jogging attire, you suspect EAH.

The finding that 44% of runners with EAH did not have maximally dilute urine suggests that SIADH contributes to hyponatremia in some patients.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  The key to understanding EAH is that it develops rapidly unlike most other causes of hyponatremia.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The rapid development causes more severe symptoms at lesser degrees of hyponatremia. Falls in serum sodium of 7–10% can produce symptoms resulting in symptomatic hyponatremia even in patients with sodium levels of 125–130 mEq/L.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The rapid onset of hyponatremia renders the plasma hypotonic relative to the brain, (which still has normal osmolality), leading to an osmotic influx of water into the brain and cerebral edema.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Hyponatremia and cerebral edema cause neurologic symptoms, including confusion, headaches, vomiting, seizures, coma, herniation, and death.

The hyponatremia in EAH develops rapidly and an aggressive approach to correction and treatment is safe and recommended. This contrasts with most hyponatremic patients who have <em>chronic</em> hyponatremia, in whom rapid correction can cause a life-threatening complication, the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS, see Table 24-3).</p><p><strong>Table 24-2.</strong> Hyponatremia: approach to treatment.</p><p><strong>Table 24-3.</strong> Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).</p><p>1.  ODS is a life-threatening complication of <em>overly rapid correction</em> of severe <em>chronic</em> hyponatremia (&lt; 120 mEq/L for 2 or more days).</p><p>2.  Acute hyponatremia renders the serum sodium hypotonic relative to the astrocytes, causing water influx, astrocyte swelling, and cerebral edema.</p><p>3.  In chronic hyponatremia (> 48 hours), the astrocytes in the brain extrude osmols and lower their intracellular osmolality to match the hypotonic serum. This adaptive response causes water efflux and decreases cerebral edema.</p><p>4.  Rapid <em>correction</em> of chronic hyponatremia renders the serum hypertonic compared to hypotonic astrocytes, causing water efflux, damaging their cytoskeleton and DNA and potentially causing cell death and demyelination.</p><p>5.  The major risk factor for ODS is rapid correction of hyponatremia in patients with marked chronic hyponatremia (virtually always ≤ 120, usually ≤ 105 mEq/L).</p><p>6.  Increased risk in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, diuretic-associated hyponatremia, treated cortisol deficiency, Na+ &lt; 105 mEq/L, hypokalemia, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, advanced liver disease, and vaptan treatment.</p><p>7.  Pons most commonly affected, but other areas of white matter may also be affected.</p><p>8.  Develops 2–6 days after correction.</p><p>9.  Spastic quadriparesis and pseudobulbar palsy (dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia), coma, movement disorders, seizures, ataxia, behavioral disorders, and death may occur.</p><p>10.  Lesions may not be apparent on MRI for up to 4 weeks after symptoms develop.</p><p>11.  Desmopressin and D5W have been used to slow or reverse the rate of rise in serum sodium when it is too rapid.</p><p>12.  Desmopressin in conjunction with 3% normal saline has also been used preemptively to prevent a rapid rise in serum sodium in patients at high risk for ODS.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  The choice of therapy is guided by the severity of symptoms, not simply the sodium concentration.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Regardless of symptom severity, hypotonic or isotonic saline (normal saline, lactated Ringers) or oral hypotonic fluids are contraindicated because they may worsen the hyponatremia in patients who have elevated ADH levels.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Severe symptoms:</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  3% normal saline (hypertonic saline) is recommended in patients with hyponatremia (≤ 125 mEq/L) <em>and</em> severe symptoms (confusion, seizures, coma).</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  An initial bolus of 100 mL (of 3% normal saline) is recommended.

In contradistinction, the increased water intake in psychogenic polydipsia suppresses ADH, increasing free water excretion and results in a <em>dilute</em> urine.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Hyponatremia develops only when massive water ingestion is sufficient to overcome maximal urinary free water excretion and then dilutes the serum sodium, which usually requires > 8–10 L/day fluid intake. (Less water intake can cause hyponatremia in patients with reduced kidney function who are unable to excrete large volumes of free water.)</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Therefore, urine osmolality is usually maximally dilute (≈ 40–100 mOsm/L) which is the key to diagnosis.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Reported in 6–20% of chronically ill, hospitalized psychiatric patients.

Since water excretion is normal, the patient excretes the excess water promptly and hyponatremia resolves rapidly. However, this must be done carefully in patients with marked hyponatremia (Na ≤ 120 mEq/L) to avoid over-rapid correct of hyponatremia and ODS.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Urine osmolality</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Mean urine osmolality 144 ± 23 mOsm/L vs 500 mOsm/L in SIADH and 539 mOsm/L in hypovolemic patients.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Surprisingly, not all patients with psychogenic polydipsia have a maximally dilute urine. Several problems can aggravate the hyponatremia in psychogenic polydipsia and complicate the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Psychotic episodes may cause a transient release of ADH or an increased renal responsiveness to ADH.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  In addition, nausea or psychiatric medications can induce concomitant SIADH (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and phenothiazines). This accentuates the hyponatremia and can produce a higher than expected urine osmolality.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The urine sodium is often low (despite euvolemia) due to the dilution of the sodium in the urine by the massive excretion of water (mean 18 mEq/L). This can incorrectly suggest hypovolemia. However, the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is a more accurate measure of volume and sodium handling and is > 0.5% in 66% of patients.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  CNS tumors may trigger polydipsia and cause hyponatremia.

It is worth emphasizing that water restriction is far more effective for patients with water intoxication than for other causes of hyponatremia. Over-rapid correction puts patients at risk for ODS (Table 24-3) and must be avoided.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Table 24-2 summarizes the therapeutic approach to hyponatremia.</p><a href=#case-resolution><h3 id=case-resolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>As Mr. P regains normal consciousness, he reports that he saw blood in his urine 2 days ago and began drinking as much water as possible “gallons and gallons” over the last 36 hours to prevent a clot from forming in his bladder and blocking his urination, (which he feared has happened, given his lower abdominal pain).

Laboratory studies reveal a glucose of 100 mg/dL; K+, 3.8 mEq/L; BUN, 28 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.0 mg/dL; and a serum osmolality of 252 mOsm/L.

The urine osmolality is high enough to effectively rule out water intoxication (from psychogenic polydipsia, beer potomania, or Ecstasy use). The low serum osmolality confirms true hypo-osmolar hyponatremia ruling out pseudohyponatremia. His serum creatinine is also normal ruling out kidney failure.</p><p>As often happens, the initial laboratories studies are not diagnostic. In cases such as this, the second key pivotal point is to ascertain whether Mr. D is clinically hypervolemic, euvolemic, or hypovolemic in order to focus the differential diagnosis (Figure 24-2).</p><p>Physical exam reveals a disheveled man appearing older than 42.

The final step in clinically hypervolemic patients explores the differential diagnosis looking for risk factors, associated symptoms and signs of possible diagnoses: HF, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, and kidney failure. Of these, cirrhosis seems most likely. The smell of alcohol raises the suspicion of alcohol abuse and liver disease, and the bulging flanks suggest ascites due to cirrhosis. HF is also possible, although Mr. D has neither an S3 gallop nor JVD. Nonetheless, HF should still be considered since neither finding is sensitive enough to rule out HF (and HF can also cause ascites). Kidney failure is effectively ruled out by his normal creatinine. Nephrotic syndrome remains a possibility, since we do not have any information yet about proteinuria or the serum albumin level.

HF and nephrotic syndrome are effectively ruled out by the echocardiogram and urinalysis. The key therapeutic decision is the rate at which to increase his serum sodium. Several features suggest great care should be given to avoid overcorrection. First, he does not have severe neurologic symptoms (coma or seizures) that would mandate acute and rapid correction. Second, the hyponatremia is likely chronic. Both the chronicity and his liver disease increase his risk for ODS, a potentially fatal neurologic complication that may develop when chronic hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly (Table 24-3). An important aspect of his care is to ensure a safe and gradual return of his serum sodium to normal.</p><p>Mr. D’s mild hyponatremia is corrected slowly.

Her past medical history is remarkable only for hypertension that is treated with amlodipine. Routine chemistries reveal a serum sodium of 123 mEq/L. Her potassium and other electrolytes and creatinine are normal. Her glucose is 108 mg/dL and BUN is 28 mg/dL. Follow up labs reveal a serum osmolality is 265 mOsm/L and urine osmolality of 470 mOsm/L.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Again, the first step in evaluating the patient with hyponatremia is to review the history, physical exam, and initial lab findings for highly specific clues that point to a particular diagnosis (ie, a history of thiazide use, recent marathon, marked hyperglycemia, unexplained hyperkalemia, a maximally dilute urine or normal serum osmolality) (see Figure 24-1). She is not taking a thiazide diuretic, and her blood glucose and potassium are normal, ruling out marked hyperglycemic hyponatremia and making the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency less likely. Her urine osmolality is normal ruling out some form of water intoxication. Her serum creatinine is normal (ruling out kidney failure) and her serum osmolality is low, confirming true hypo-osmolar hyponatremia and ruling out pseudohyponatremia. The second key pivotal point is to classify Mrs. L’s clinical volume status as hypervolemic, euvolemic, or hypovolemic (see Figure 24-2). A careful exam should search for signs of hypervolemia (edema, JVD, S3 gallop, crackles, or ascites) or hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia, or orthostatic hypotension).</p><p>Mrs. L denies any history that suggests volume loss (vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive perspiration). She denies symptoms suggestive of hypervolemia such as edema, dyspnea on exertion, or orthopnea. Furthermore, she has no history of any of the diseases associated with hypervolemic states (HF, cirrhosis, kidney disease, or nephrotic syndrome). On physical exam, BP is normal with no significant change going from lying to standing. There is no pretibial or pedal edema. Cardiovascular exam reveals no JVD or S3 gallop. She has no crackles on lung exam, and there are no signs of ascites (bulging flanks, shifting dullness).</p><p>Mrs. L’s history and exam suggest neither hypervolemia nor hypovolemia. Therefore, she is classified as <em>clinically</em> euvolemic.</p><p>The third key pivotal step reviews her urine sodium to distinguish true euvolemia from subtle hypovolemia (see Figure 24-3).</p><p>Mrs. L’s urine sodium concentration is 60 mEq/L.</p><p>The elevated urine sodium argues against hypovolemia and is consistent with the clinical impression that Mrs. L is euvolemic. The final step explores the differential diagnosis for euvolemic hyponatremia (see Figure 24-4). Causes include SIADH (most common), secondary adrenal insufficiency, and severe hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 50 milli-international units/mL). Although other disease states can cause euvolemic hyponatremia (such as the water intoxication states and thiazide use), these are usually diagnosed initially by history or a low urine osmolality. At this point the leading hypothesis is SIADH. Table 24-7 lists the differential diagnosis. Further history and laboratory studies may help rank the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 24-7.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mrs. L.</p><p>Past medical history: As noted above, she has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Social history: 40-pack-year history of smoking. Alcohol use is minimal. Mrs. L denies any drug use. Review of systems is unremarkable. Her TSH is 2.3 milli-international units/L (normal &lt; 4.0 milli-international units/L).</p><p>Mrs. L’s history is not particularly diagnostic. Her normal TSH essentially rules out primary hypothyroidism. Her recent cough and tobacco history raise the possibility of SIADH from a lung cancer. Adrenal insufficiency is a potentially life-threatening cause of hyponatremia and should be considered a “must not miss” diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) increases because the hypothalamic pituitary axis attempts to compensate for the hypocortisolism.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Secondary adrenal insufficiency develops when damage to the hypothalamic pituitary system results in inadequate corticotropin (ACTH) production resulting in inadequate adrenal stimulation and hypocortisolism.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  In both cases (primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency), cortisol levels are low. Cortisol normally suppresses ADH release. Decreased cortisol causes increased ADH levels and promotes hyponatremia.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Primary adrenal insufficiency</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The destruction of the adrenal gland often results in decreased synthesis of <em>other</em> adrenal hormones as well as cortisol. Aldosterone, DHEA, and catecholamine synthesis may be impaired.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Aldosterone deficiency results in salt losses and clinical hypovolemia. The hypovolemia may further stimulate ADH release. Finally, the aldosterone deficiency may also cause hyperkalemia.</p><p>Suspect <em>primary</em> adrenal insufficiency in hyponatremic patients with hyperkalemia.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  DHEA deficiency affects women but not men (due to the presence of more potent testicular androgens). Findings may include decreased libido, decreased axillary and pubic hair, and amenorrhea.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Catecholamine synthesis is also usually impaired (except in autoimmune adrenal disease).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  When secondary to autoimmune destruction (see below) may also be associated with other autoimmune diseases: hypothyroidism (47%), type 1 diabetes (12%), vitamin B12 deficiency (10%), and premature ovarian failure (6.6% of women)</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Secondary adrenal insufficiency (hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Decreased ACTH results in decreased cortisol levels, increasing ADH and causing hyponatremia.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hyponatremia may be precipitated by inter-current illness, leading to inadequate cortisol response; 43% of patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency had superimposed infection when presenting with hyponatremia.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  May be associated with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones (ie, luteinizing hormone [LH], TSH) resulting in concomitant hypogonadism or hypothyroidism.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Unlike primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal gland is not destroyed in secondary adrenal insufficiency.

He has been brought to the emergency department with lethargy and confusion. Serum chemistries reveal a sodium level of 168 mEq/L.</p><p>As noted in Chapter 1, the first task when evaluating patients is to identify their problem(s). Like hyponatremic patients, hypernatremic patients often suffer from an altered sensorium; hypernatremia is found on serum chemistries. In addition to evaluating other possible causes of confusion, the cause of the hypernatremia should be determined and treatment initiated since the hypernatremia may be contributing to the delirium.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of hypernatremia? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis-1><h4 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h4></a><p>Hypernatremia (defined as serum sodium > 145 mEq/L) is almost always secondary to a free water deficit. The differential diagnosis of hypernatremia is markedly simpler than that of hyponatremia and usually develops in 1 of 3 situations: (1) impaired water intake, (2) hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, or rarely (3) diabetes insipidus.</p><p>Hypernatremia and hyperosmolality are potent stimulators not only of ADH, but also of thirst, which promotes drinking and protects against hypernatremia. Therefore, hypernatremia occurs almost exclusively in patients who are either unaware of their thirst or physically unable to get to water. The most common clinical scenarios involve infants or debilitated elderly patients with severe dementia. In such patients, normal insensible water losses or increased water loss (ie, from diarrhea) are not matched by oral intake and hypernatremia develops. Normal kidneys respond by maximizing water reabsorption resulting in a high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/L). In over 50% of elderly patients, a superimposed process (ie, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cerebrovascular accident) is present. The 30-day mortality in elderly hypernatremic patients has been reported at 41.5%.</p><p>Clinicians should search for an underlying cause in patients discovered to have hypernatremia.</p><p>Hypernatremia may also develop in patients with marked hyperglycemia. The osmotic diuresis results in a free water loss and may result in hypernatremia if free water intake is impaired due to an altered sensorium. The magnitude of the hypernatremia may not be obvious on initial laboratory results because the hyperglycemia draws water from the intracellular compartment into the extracellular compartment diluting the sodium concentration. With treatment of the hyperglycemia, water moves back to the intracellular space and the hypernatremia worsens. (See Chapter 12, Diabetes.)</p><p>Other causes of hypernatremia are rare and will be touched upon here only briefly. Hypernatremia may develop in patients with impaired renal <em>water conservation</em> (ie, diabetes insipidus). Even in these patients, increased thirst normally prompts increased water intake and allows such patients to compensate and maintain normal serum sodium levels. (These patients complain of polydipsia and polyuria.) Hypernatremia may develop when a superimposed process limits water intake. The urine osmolality in such patients is inappropriately low (&lt; 600 mOsm/L). Diabetes insipidus can result from pituitary processes that decrease ADH production or renal processes, which cause resistance to ADH. Finally, very rare causes of hypernatremia include hypothalamic lesions, which render patients unaware of thirst despite a normal sensorium, or increased salt intake (ie, infusion of hypertonic saline or salt water ingestion).</p><p>In summary, the approach to hypernatremia focuses on a thorough history and physical exam with particular emphasis on the assessment of vital signs, orthostasis, and dehydration. A urine osmolality, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose are often adequate to determine the etiology. Figure 24-7 outlines the approach to hypernatremia.</p><p><strong>Figure 24-7.</strong> Approach to hypernatremia.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-hypernatremia><h4 id=differential-diagnosis-of-hypernatremia><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Differential Diagnosis of Hypernatremia</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Impaired water intake: urine osmolality > 600 mOsm/L</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Neurologic disease (eg, dementia, delirium, coma, stroke)</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Water unavailable (ie, desert conditions)</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Osmotic diuresis with impaired water intake</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Postobstructive diuresis</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Rare etiologies</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Diabetes insipidus (if associated with decreased water intake)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Neurogenic diabetes insipidus (decreased ADH production)</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ADH resistance)</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Long-term lithium ingestion</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Hypercalcemia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Hypothalamic lesions causing decreased thirst</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Increased salt intake</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Salt water ingestion</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Hypertonic saline</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Isotonic saline replacement of hypotonic saline loss</p><p><strong>How reliable is the history and physical exam for detecting hypernatremia?</strong></p><p>Signs and symptoms develop due to dehydration (tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dry mucous membranes and axilla) and due to the hypernatremia (depressed sensorium, coma, focal deficits, and seizures).

This is the leading hypothesis. Marked hyperglycemia should always be considered a “must not miss” alternative. Inadequate water conservation due to diabetes insipidus is possible but far less common. Table 24-9 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 24-9.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. R.</p><p>The nursing home reports that Mr. R has had a cough for the last 3 days with low-grade fever. Over the last 48 hours, he has become progressively less responsive and his oral intake and urinary output have dropped dramatically.</p><p>Mr. R is minimally responsive to stimuli. Vital signs are BP, 110/70 mm Hg; pulse, 110 bpm; temperature, 38.1°C; RR, 20 breaths per minute. His oral mucosa is parched and his axilla dry. Lung exam is difficult to evaluate due to poor effort. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia; neck veins are flat. There is no S3 or S4. Laboratory findings: Na, 168 mEq/L; K, 4.2 mEq/L; HCO3−, 24 mEq/L; chloride, 134 mEq/L; BUN, 45 mg/dL; creatinine, 1 mg/dL. Serum glucose is 150 mg/dL.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

A superimposed illness may worsen cognitive function, decrease oral intake, and promote hypernatremia. Mental status is almost always impaired and may vary from confusion to frank coma.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-10><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p>The diagnosis is easily confirmed by the presence of hypernatremia, increased urine osmolality, and absence of hyperglycemia.</p><a href=#treatment-11><h5 id=treatment-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  The brain adapts to hypernatremia by increasing intracellular osmolality to minimize cellular dehydration.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Rapid correction of hypernatremia makes the serum hypotonic relative to the brain. This promotes osmotic movement of water into the brain and cerebral edema. Seizures and death can occur if correction is too rapid, although this occurs almost exclusively in children.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Hypernatremia should be corrected slowly ≅ 0.4 mEq/L/h (≤ 10 mEq/L/day).</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  A recommended approach includes the following:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Normal saline to correct the patient’s concomitant volume deficit</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Hypernatremic patients are usually markedly hypovolemic. If hypotensive, they may be 10% dehydrated (7L in a 70-kg man).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Often patients will take several 1-liter boluses to improve BP, resolve orthostasis, and improve urinary output.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Normal saline boluses commonly administered as 500–1000 mL over 1 hour</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Patients should be reevaluated after each bolus. Vital signs and orthostasis should be rechecked, and patients should have a careful heart and lung exam to ensure they are not receiving excessive fluid. Urinary output should be monitored.</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Once BP and urinary output are restored, boluses can be stopped and the remaining fluid deficit divided over the next 48 hours.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  D5W @ 1.35 mL/hour/kg should be administered to restore the free water deficit and correct hyponatremia by &lt; 10 mEq/L/day.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Add ongoing free water losses, if any.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Remeasure serum sodium frequently (every 4–6 hours) to ensure rate is neither too excessive nor too slow.</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis-3><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mr. R’s urine osmolality is 850 mOsm/L.</p><p>The elevated urine osmolality confirms urinary concentrating ability and establishes inadequate fluid intake (versus inadequate conservation) as the etiology. An evaluation of the underlying precipitant is also important.</p><p>A chest film reveals a right lower lobe pneumonia. Blood cultures grow <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</em></p><p>As in the overwhelming majority of cases of hypernatremia, the diagnosis is straightforward. The history, exam, and elevated urine osmolality all confirm hypernatremia due to decreased intake. Urine concentrating ability is intact. Serum glucose is normal. The cause of his deterioration is evident (his pneumonia and bacteremia). Further diagnostic testing is not required.</p><a href=#case-resolution-3><h3 id=case-resolution-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>Mr. R is given D5W. His body weight is measured at 140 lbs (63 kg). The rate of free water administration must be determined. He is given piperacillin-tazobactam to treat his aspiration pneumonia.</p><p>Three days after D5W is started, his electrolytes are normal. He gradually returns to his baseline neurologic function and is discharged after 6 days of therapy to continue his oral antibiotics at the nursing home.</p><a href=#hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state><h4 id=hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State</h4></a><p>See Chapter 12, Diabetes.</p><a href=#references><h3 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>REFERENCES</h3></a><p>Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB et al.
