# Staging of breast cancer
* Anatomic: tumor size, chest wall invasion, axillary LN mets (strongest prognostic factor)
* Histopathologic: type (little prognostic relevance) & grade; lymphatic/vascular invasion
    In situ carcinoma: no invasion of surrounding stroma
    Ductal (DCIS): ↑ risk of invasive cancer in ipsilateral breast (~30%/10 y)
    Lobular (LCIS): benign entity; marker of ↑ risk of inv. cancer in either breast (~1%/y)
    Invasive carcinoma: infiltrating ductal (70–80%); invasive lobular (5–10%); tubular, medullary and mucinous (10%, better prognosis); papillary (1–2%); other (1–2%)
    Inflammatory breast cancer (see above): not a histologic type but a clinical reflection of tumor invasion of dermal lymphatics; very poor prognosis
    Paget disease (see above): ductal cancer invading nipple epidermis ± associated mass
* Tissue biomarkers: estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR), HER2
* Oncotype DX 21-gene expression recurrence score predicts which ER ⊕, HER2 ⊖ will have minimal benefit from adjuvant chemo in LN ⊖ (NEJM 2018;379:111) and LN ⊕ (1–3) disease (NEJM 2021;385:2336)
