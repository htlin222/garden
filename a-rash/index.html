How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>In clinical practice, rashes are diagnosed through pattern recognition (sometimes called system 1 reasoning) probably more than any other complaint. This is an effective way of making a diagnosis when the diagnosis is obvious or when the observer is very experienced. The risk with this type of reasoning is that diagnostic hypotheses are heavily influenced by recent experience, rare diagnoses tend not to be recognized, and physicians often reach premature closure on an incorrect diagnosis.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of a rash should be based on the morphology of the lesion. This can be considered the first pivotal point in the differential diagnosis. To correctly categorize a lesion’s morphology, the physician must first identify the primary lesion, the typical element of the eruption. This process can be complicated as the primary lesion is often affected by secondary changes such as excoriation, erosion, crusting, or coalescence. Because the differential diagnosis of 1 lesion can be extensive, once the morphology of the primary lesion is identified, the next pivotal points are determining the global reaction pattern and observing the distribution of lesions. What follows are some important definitions, followed by a differential diagnosis of some of the most common reaction patterns.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Macule: lesion without elevation or depression, &lt; 1 cm</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Patch: lesion without elevation or depression, > 1 cm</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Papule: any solid, elevated “bump” &lt; 1 cm</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Plaque: raised plateau-like lesion of variable size, often a confluence of papules</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Nodule: solid lesion with palpable elevation, 1–5 cm</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Tumor: solid growth, > 5 cm</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Cyst: encapsulated lesion, filled with soft material</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  Vesicle: elevated, fluid-filled blister, &lt; 1 cm</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  Bulla: elevated, fluid-filled blister, > 1 cm</p><p><strong>10.</strong>  Pustule: elevated, pus-filled blister, any size</p><p><strong>11.</strong>  Wheal: inflamed papule or plaque formed by transient and superficial local edema</p><p><strong>12.</strong>  Comedone: a plug of keratinous material and skin oils retained in a follicle; open comedone has a black inclusion, closed comedone appears flesh-colored or pinkish</p><p>Primary lesions are further grouped into reaction patterns. Papulosquamous eruptions present with papules and plaques associated with superficial scaling. Folliculopapular eruptions begin as papules arising in a perifollicular distribution. Dermal reaction patterns result from infiltrative and inflammatory processes involving the dermal and subcutaneous tissues. Petechia and purpura occur when there is leakage of blood products into surrounding tissues from inflamed or damaged blood vessels. Blistering disorders present with vesicles and bullae. A differential diagnosis of rash is listed below and Figure 29-1 presents an algorithm of a possible approach to patients with rashes and skin lesions.</p><p><strong>Figure 29-1.</strong> Approach to the patient with rash or skin lesion.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Blistering disorders (vesicles, pustules, and bullae)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Autoimmune</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Bullous pemphigoid</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Pemphigus vulgaris</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Hypersensitivity syndromes</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Stevens-Johnson syndrome</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Toxic epidermal necrolysis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Herpes simplex</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Impetigo</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Staphylococcal scalded skin</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Varicella zoster</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Dermal reaction patterns</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Erythema nodosum</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Granuloma annulare</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Sarcoidosis</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Urticaria</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Folliculopapular eruptions (perifollicular papules)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Acne vulgaris</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Folliculitis</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Perioral dermatitis</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Rosacea</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Papulosquamous eruptions (papules and plaques with scale)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Eczematous dermatitis</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Allergic contact dermatitis</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Atopic dermatitis</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Irritant contact dermatitis</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Pityriasis rosea</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Psoriasis</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Seborrheic dermatitis</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Tinea infections</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Purpura and petechiae</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Nonpalpable purpura</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Actinic/senile purpura</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Amyloidosis</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Bacteremia</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Benign pigmented purpura</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Corticosteroid-associated</p><p><strong>f.</strong>  Disseminated intravascular coagulation</p><p><strong>g.</strong>  Medication-related</p><p><strong>h.</strong>  Thrombocytopenia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Palpable purpura</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Bacteremia</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Rocky Mountain spotted fever</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Meningococcemia</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Leukocytoclastic vasculitis</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Allergic vasculitis</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Henoch-Schönlein purpura</p><p>Ms. N complains of frequent “breakouts” on her face for the last several years. She reports the use of many topical over-the-counter agents over the years. She complains of feeling greasy and the need to “squeeze pus” out of lesions on a regular basis.</p><p>On examination, there are many erythematous papules, occasional pustules, and open and closed comedones on the forehead, cheeks, and chin. There is a predominance of larger nodules along the jaw line. Similar erythematous papules involve the upper back and chest. There is neither significant background erythema nor scaling in the scalp, eyebrows, or nasolabial folds. Figure 29-2 shows her on her initial visit.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><p><strong>Figure 29-2.</strong> Ms. N on initial presentation.</p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The pivotal clues, in this case, are the morphology of the lesion and its distribution. This patient has a folliculopapular eruption that predominantly affects the face, chest, and upper back. Primary lesions of inflammatory papules, pustules, and comedones place acne at the top of the differential. The history is typical for acne: a chronic course with intermittent flares.</p><p>Other folliculopapular conditions must be considered. The lack of background erythema and telangiectasias makes a diagnosis of rosacea less likely. Perioral dermatitis typically presents as monomorphic small papules and is closely associated with the use of topical corticosteroids and cosmetics. The mixture of lesion type, with comedones as well as papules and nodules, and the more diffuse distribution makes acne more likely than perioral dermatitis. An infectious folliculitis is possible, but the course of the disease makes this extremely unlikely (Table 29-1).</p><p><strong>Table 29-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. N.</p><p>The patient is in good health and is not overweight. She is not taking any oral medications. She reports regular menstrual cycles and notes that the breakouts are worse around the time of her period. She does not report easy flushing or any increased hair growth on the face or chest. She has 1 healthy child.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

One day before his visit, he noticed a rash on the left side of his chest, just lateral to his sternum. He describes the rash as small bumps, blisters, and red patches. He says that the skin is extremely sensitive to light touch. He otherwise feels well, without fever or constitutional symptoms.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Several general etiologic categories need to be considered when presented with a patient with new-onset blisters or vesicles. Blisters can be a symptom of infection, autoimmune disease, or a reaction to an external stimulus. Infectious causes include varicella zoster virus (VZV), presenting either as chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles), and bullous impetigo. Both are possible in this patient. The prodromal pain and unilateral, dermatomal distribution suggest VZV. Bullous impetigo can cause blisters in a young, healthy person, but these blisters often begin in intertriginous areas. Bullous impetigo is most common in children. Grouped blisters suggest VZV or herpes simplex virus (HSV), whereas other blistering diseases may demonstrate large distinct blisters or erosions.</p><p>Bullous arthropod bites can affect patients of any age. A history of exposure should be elicited. The numerous, small, clustered lesions, in this case, make arthropod bites a less likely diagnosis. Bullous pemphigoid and other autoimmune blistering disorders are rare but possible. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is unlikely given the subacute onset but is certainly a “must not miss” diagnosis (Table 29-2).</p><p><strong>Table 29-2.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. B.</p><p>The patient reports no significant medical history. He recently finished a course of amoxicillin for pharyngitis. He also frequently helps his mother with gardening. The patient is afebrile with normal vital signs. The physical exam demonstrates clusters of small vesicles, filled with clear fluid, overlying erythematous skin. There is no lymphadenopathy. The rest of the skin exam is unremarkable (Figure 29-4).</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Because the rash was thought to be somewhat atypical, a fresh vesicle was unroofed with a scalpel tip and the vesicle fluid was sent for PCR testing.</p><p>The diagnosis of varicella zoster is often clinical. The distribution and clinical appearance of lesions, as well as the associated prodromal symptoms, can make the diagnosis obvious. Impetigo, bullous arthropod bites, and autoimmune blistering diseases typically demonstrate larger distinct blisters or erosions. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and other drug reactions must always be considered when medications are in use. This patient was taking amoxicillin.

The rash developed first on her trunk and over the last 2 weeks is spreading to her extremities (Figure 29-10). She denies any history of similar eruptions. She states she is otherwise feeling well. This eruption is not particularly itchy. On examination, there are many 1–2 cm discrete, brightly erythematous plaques and papules with adherent white scale. The lesions are predominantly on the trunk but extend onto the extremities. Some lesions appear somewhat linear in configuration, whereas most are round to oval in shape. The scale is confluent over the surface of the lesions. The nails are normal and the palms and soles are clear. The oropharynx is injected with some tonsillar enlargement but without exudates. The tongue appears geographic. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><p><strong>Figure 29-10.</strong> Ms. M on initial presentation.</p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The appearance of the eruption suggests that this condition is papulosquamous in morphology, meaning that the eruption is composed primarily of papules and plaques with scale. Common causes of papulosquamous eruptions are psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, fungal infections, and nummular dermatitis.</p><p>The patient’s age, acute onset of the rash, and the pattern of small papules and plaques are pivotal points suggesting either guttate psoriasis or pityriasis rosea. In addition, the finding of pharyngeal injection suggests that there may be an infectious component (as is common with guttate psoriasis). The configuration of the lesions and the scale can be very helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. This patient’s scale is confluent over the surface of the lesions, consistent with guttate psoriasis. Tinea infections typically have scale at the border of the lesions (leading edge with advancing scale) and pityriasis rosea has scale at the center of the lesion (trailing scale). Nummular dermatitis is usually found on the extremities and is associated with significant pruritus, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Secondary syphilis needs to be considered as a “must not miss” diagnosis. Syphilis can present with plaques, but they often involve the palms and soles and lack an adherent scale (Table 29-4).</p><p><strong>Table 29-4.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Ms. M.</p><p>On further questioning, the patient does recall a sore throat several weeks ago.

Telangiectasias on the surface can be a helpful sign.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Large tumors can be locally destructive.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Basal cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor in humans.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Lesions are typically asymptomatic except for the observation of easy bleeding from a site.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Only rarely is pain associated.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Metastasis from a basal cell carcinoma is rare.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Individuals at risk are adults with fair hair and eyes, easy freckling, and propensity for sunburn.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Patients with skin of color are less likely to be affected.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Men and women are about equally affected.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Exposure to UV light has long been believed to play a causative role in the development of this tumor, although the exact mechanism is not clear. Several genetic mutations have been isolated in basal cell carcinoma and may serve as targets for therapeutics.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Chronic wounds and sites of inflammation, as well as, immunosuppression can predispose to development of this tumor.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Exposure to arsenic is another risk factor for basal cell carcinoma.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  The head and neck are the most common sites affected with this tumor.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Only 10–15% of tumors develop on sun-protected skin.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The nose is the most common site, accounting for 20–30% of all cases.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Basal cell carcinoma is likely derived from the hair follicle. The name implies a resemblance of the tumor cells to the basal cells of the epidermis, although this is not believed to be their derivation.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Patients have up to a 45% risk of developing subsequent basal cell carcinomas in the 5 years after initial diagnosis.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-14><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p>Histologic evaluation of affected tissue is the gold standard for diagnosis.</p><a href=#treatment-14><h5 id=treatment-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  The goal of therapy is to eliminate the tumor and prevent local tissue destruction. Numerous methods are available to accomplish this goal, and selection depends on tumor size, type, and location, patient characteristics, and patient preferences.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  5-year recurrence rates vary by treatment modality. The lowest recurrence rate is achieved with Mohs micrographic surgery.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  This method involves excision of the visible tumor, followed by microscopic evaluation of frozen tissue sections to visualize tumor margins and repeat local excision until all margins are clear of tumor.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The technique allows for maximal tissue sparing while ensuring complete eradication of tumor.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Follow-up of patients for recurrent or subsequent tumors is critical.</p><a href=#2-squamous-cell-carcinoma><h4 id=2-squamous-cell-carcinoma><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2.

This may include lymph node dissection in some instances.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Multiple destruction modalities are available and are selected based on size, shape, and location of the tumor as well as patient preferences. These modalities include, but are not limited to</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Surgical excision</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Mohs micrographic surgery</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Electrosurgery</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Radiation therapy</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Local immunotherapy</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Wide destruction of these tumors usually results in cure as squamous cell carcinomas grow by direct extension. However, residual tumor can invade and extend along peripheral nerves, occasionally resulting in a deep recurrence.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  A large percentage of squamous cell carcinomas could be prevented by avoidance of excessive solar exposure. Routine screening for tumors, especially in high-risk patients, is imperative.</p><a href=#3-melanoma><h4 id=3-melanoma><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3.

Worldwide, whites have the highest risk of developing melanoma, and Asian populations have the lowest risk.</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  Epidemiologic studies strongly suggest that sun exposure is a major risk factor for the development of cutaneous melanoma in the light-skinned populations.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Intense intermittent episodes of sun exposure before 18 years of age are thought to engender the highest risk in susceptible populations.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Phenotypic features have been associated with increased risk for cutaneous melanoma: light skin pigmentation, ease of sun burning, blond or red hair, prominent freckling, and blue or green eyes.</p><p><strong>I.</strong>  Familial melanoma accounts for 8–12% of cases. Those with at least 2 first-degree relatives with a history of melanoma are at particularly high risk.</p><p><strong>J.</strong>  Dysplastic nevi (clinically atypical appearing nevi) are thought to be markers of an individual with an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The number of nevi on the body has been directly correlated with the magnitude of melanoma risk.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  About one-third of melanomas have been associated with an underlying nevus.</p><p><strong>K.</strong>  Recurrences of disease generally occur in a stepwise manner, first locally, then in regional lymph nodes, and lastly as distant metastases.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-16><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-16><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  An excisional biopsy is the preferred method for obtaining tissue for diagnosis. This preserves the extent of the primary tumor and all associated histologic features without disrupting the lymphatic architecture.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Full-thickness incisional or punch biopsies of lesions too large to excise fully or in anatomically sensitive locations are satisfactory.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The histologic diagnosis of melanoma is based on a constellation of features; no single feature is diagnostic. Both cytologic and architectural features are evaluated.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  The staging system for melanoma follows the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system, which relies on assessment of the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and the presence or absence of distant metastases. Assessment of the primary tumor focuses on the histologic tumor thickness and presence of ulceration as the most important initial variables.</p><a href=#treatment-16><h5 id=treatment-16><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Management of cutaneous melanoma is guided by stage of disease. Wide excision of tumors is the general rule.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Sentinel lymph node mapping may be beneficial diagnostically in more advanced stages, decreasing the complications associated with full lymph node dissections.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Adjuvant treatment options for advanced stage disease include</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab) and targeted therapy (inhibition of <em>BRAF</em> and/or <em>MEK</em> genes) are first line.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Radiation therapy may have a palliative role for symptomatic localized areas of disease.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been shown to improve overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Follow-up of melanoma patients is critical to detect recurrences as well as new primary tumors and to provide ongoing education.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Melanoma prevention strategies focus on education about the risks of UV exposure via sunlight or tanning machines, sun protection guidelines, and the importance of routine self-skin exams.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Early detection is important for improving outcomes.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Patients should be instructed on the importance of their own skin examination and what constitutes a worrisome mole, easily remembered by the <em>ABCDE</em>s of mole evaluation.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  A: asymmetry</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  B: borders that are irregular or changing</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  C: color that is irregular or changing</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  D: diameter > 6 mm (or larger than a pencil eraser)</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  E: evolution of the lesion in general</p><a href=#references><h3 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>REFERENCES</h3></a><p>Brantsch KD, Meisner C, Schonfisch B et al.
