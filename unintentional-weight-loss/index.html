She is worried that she has something serious.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of unintentional weight loss? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Significant unintentional weight loss is defined as > 5% loss of usual body weight in the last 6–12 months and can be a harbinger of serious underlying disease. One study documented significantly increased mortality in men with unintentional weight loss compared with men whose weight was stable or increased (36% vs ≈ 15%). The evaluation of unintentional weight loss is complicated by its frequency among older adults; 15–20% of adults over 65 years of age may have unintentional weight loss, and the prevalence rises to 50–60% among nursing home residents. Body weight usually peaks about age 60 and then decreases gradually thereafter, especially after age 70, although the normal changes are small (&lt; 1 lb/year).</p><p>It should be noted that weight loss in the elderly is often part of an overall syndrome of functional decline called frailty, which includes weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. When present, frailty has significant implications for morbidity and mortality in the elderly and frail patients have substantially higher morbidity and mortality that their age-matched peers.</p><p>There are a large number of diseases that can cause unintentional weight loss, which are best organized by system (see below). The most common causes of unintentional weight loss in published studies are cancer (most commonly gastrointestinal [GI] but also lung, lymphoma, and other malignancies), ≈ 19–36%; depression and alcoholism, 16%; nonmalignant GI diseases, 13%; and unknown, 22%. Endocrine disorders account for 7% of unintentional weight loss. Although cancer is the most common cause, it is not the cause in most patients. Mild cognitive impairment and dementia may also cause weight loss due to a combination of increased energy expenditure (due to agitation and pacing) and decreased caloric intake.</p><p>Four pivotal points are worth remembering when evaluating patients with unintentional weight loss (Figure 32-1). First, the weight loss should be documented if possible; 25–50% of patients that complain of unintentional weight loss have not in fact lost weight (and do not need to be evaluated for causes of weight loss). Elderly adults often lose muscle mass and simply look like they lost weight. Weight loss should be documented by comparing prior weights or, if these are unavailable, by finding a significant decrease in a patient’s clothing and/or belt size. It may also be helpful to see corroborating information from family and/or caretakers and trying to elicit a specific amount of weight loss from the patient.</p><p>Clinicians should verify the weight loss or document significant changes in the patient’s clothing or belt size.</p><p>The second pivotal step identifies patients with malabsorption. Patients should be asked about changes in their bowel movements, including diarrhea or large, difficult to flush or malodorous stools. Although an uncommon cause of unintentional weight loss, such symptoms suggest small bowel or pancreatic disease and direct the diagnostic search. Additionally, difficulty with defecation or changes in stool caliber raises the possibility of colorectal cancer.</p><p>The third pivotal step differentiates weight loss that is due to decreased caloric intake from weight loss that is due to increased caloric expenditure or malabsorption. Most patients lose weight due to decreased caloric intake. Weight loss associated with normal or increased intake suggests substantial catabolism or energy loss that may be seen in patients with cancer, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, or poorly controlled diabetes.</p><p>Fourth and most importantly: a clinician is most likely to be successful in identifying the cause of a patient’s unintentional weight loss if she identifies the “company it keeps.” Clinicians should perform a truly comprehensive history (including a review of systems, psychosocial history, and medication history) and perform a detailed head to toe physical exam (with special attention to the mental status exam) to identify any abnormalities. An initial baseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, urinalysis, renal panel, calcium, hepatic panel, fasting glucose, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), HIV test, and chest radiograph. Abnormal, or potentially abnormal, findings discovered on history, physical exam, or initial labs are rarely conclusively diagnostic but often provide critical clues to the underlying diagnosis and should be thoroughly evaluated. Examples of such findings include anemia, which may be due to iron deficiency from an unsuspected carcinoma of the colon or stomach; an elevated alkaline phosphatase, which may be due to metastatic disease to the liver or bones; hematuria, which may be due to carcinoma of the kidney or bladder; or a markedly elevated ESR, which may be due to multiple myeloma, temporal arteritis, subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), or other chronic infection. Additionally, recommended preventive health exams should be brought up to date (eg, mammogram, Papanicolaou exam with human papillomavirus testing, colonoscopy or other appropriate colorectal cancer screening, prostate-specific antigen in selected patients and low-dose chest CT scan for smokers with ≥ 30 pack year smoking history unless they quit > 15 years previously).</p><p>Patients without any such clues may benefit from an upper endoscopy and an abdominal ultrasound. Figure 32-1 illustrates the diagnostic approach.</p><p><strong>Figure 32-1.</strong> Diagnostic approach: unintentional weight loss.</p><p>Interestingly, an unrevealing initial evaluation is reassuring: one study conducted in patients with weight loss showed that among those who underwent evaluation, none of those without abnormal or concerning findings on the initial evaluation were diagnosed with cancer during the study. A more recent, larger study showed that cancer may be undiagnosed antemortem but discovered on autopsy; this suggests that, while the rate of cancers diagnosed on follow-up (after the initial evaluation) is low, cancers may still be present and thus warrant ongoing clinical follow-up.</p><a href=#differential-diagnosis-of-involuntary-weight-loss><h4

She does not weigh herself and is unsure of how many pounds she has lost.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The patient’s relatively nonspecific history is typical of many patients complaining of weight loss. Patients report an unspecified amount of weight loss that is associated with anorexia. The first pivotal step in the evaluation is to verify that weight loss has, in fact, occurred.</p><p>Mrs. M is new to the clinic and prior weights are unavailable. While Mrs. M does not know how many pounds she has lost, she does report that her clothes are much too loose and she has needed to buy pants that are 2 sizes smaller.</p><p>Mrs. M’s change in clothing size suggests true and significant weight loss. The second pivotal step in evaluating patients with documented weight loss determines whether the patient has symptoms suggestive of malabsorption, such as diarrhea or floating stools.</p><p>Mrs. M does reports that she has a bowel movement daily or every other day. She notes no diarrhea, no floating or difficult to flush stools, and no change in her bowel habits over the last several years.</p><p>Since the history does not suggest diarrhea or malabsorption, the third pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with unintentional weight loss differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure. Mrs. M.’s initial complaint already clarified that her weight loss was due to anorexia and decreased caloric intake. The fourth step is a comprehensive, system-based approach utilizing a thorough history, (including a past medical history, detailed psychosocial history, and review of systems), physical exam, basic laboratory tests, and completion of her age-appropriate health maintenance examinations to search for diagnostic clues.</p><p>Mrs. M’s past medical history is unrevealing, including a review in the Electronic Health Record. Her psychosocial history is also unrevealing. She lives with her husband (who is in good health), and they have no difficulty obtaining or cooking food. She has never smoked tobacco and drinks alcohol rarely. The review of systems is negative in detail.</p><p>On physical exam, Mrs. M looks cachectic and fatigued. Her vital signs are normal. HEENT exam reveals no oral lesions or adenopathy. Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals a normal rate and regular rhythm, with a grade II flow systolic murmur along the left sternal border without radiation. Her abdomen is scaphoid, without hepatosplenomegaly or mass. FOBT is negative. Neurologic exam is normal, including a Mini- Mental State Exam on which her score is 29/30.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Given her cachectic appearance (suggesting her weight loss is real despite the lack of documentation) and the fact that cancer is the most common cause of unintentional weight loss and a must not miss hypothesis, it is the leading hypothesis that must be evaluated at this point. Her tired appearance also raises the possibility of depression (which could be either a primary psychiatric disorder or a reaction to an underlying medical condition). Finally, nonmalignant GI disease should also be considered, since it is also a common cause of unintentional weight loss. Hyperthyroidism is also on the differential.

The data suggest that when the cause of unintentional weight loss is malignant, there are usually clues on history, physical exam, or on laboratory testing. You elect to check a CBC, liver panel, renal panel, urinalysis, chest radiograph, and screening mammogram. Finally, you elect to schedule Mrs. M for a colonoscopy, since she has never undergone colon cancer screening. You discuss that this is different than usual age-appropriate colon cancer screening, for which she is above the age at which screening is still recommended; this is a diagnostic evaluation with a substantially different pretest probability.</p><p>Surprisingly, Mrs. M’s laboratory evaluation is normal. Her CBC is normal without evidence of iron deficiency anemia (which could have suggested gastric or colorectal cancer). The chest radiograph is also normal, making lung cancer unlikely, particularly in a patient who never smoked. ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal and her kidney function is normal. Her HIV test is negative and there was no hematuria on urinalysis (which could suggest renal cell carcinoma or bladder cancer). Her mammogram and colonoscopy were normal.</p><p><strong>Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading hypothesis, cancer cachexia? Have you ruled out the active alternatives?

Therapy should be strongly considered in grieving patients with persistent symptoms of MDD for more than 2 months after a loss.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Multiple classes of medications are effective: SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  A patient-level meta-analysis reported that pharmacotherapy was effective. The benefit is most marked in patients with very severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≥ 25). The numbers needed to treat are 16, 11, and 4 for patients with mild to moderate, severe, and very severe depression, respectively.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  SSRIs are often used as first-line agents due to low frequency of adverse effects and safety in overdose. Both SSRIs and SNRIs may cause sexual dysfunction. Venlafaxine (an SNRI) can be lethal in overdose.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Caution is recommended in the use of SSRIs in certain age groups:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The USPSTF concluded that fair evidence suggests that SSRIs increase suicidal behaviors in patients 18–29 years of age, especially those with MDD who receive paroxetine (OR 6.7; CI, 1.1–149.4). The risk was highest in the first month of treatment.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  For those age groups, alternative medications or psychotherapy may be preferred.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Mirtazapine may be useful in patients with weight loss, poor appetite, and insomnia and bupropion may be useful in patients with daytime lethargy and fatigue.</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  TCAs frequently cause troubling anticholinergic side effects (including dysrhythmias), significant weight gain (> 20 lbs) and are dangerous in overdose, so they are used less frequently. High-dose TCAs may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.</p><p><strong>9.</strong>  MAOIs interact with a variety of tyramine-containing foods and medications and may precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Typically, only psychiatrists prescribe these.</p><p><strong>10.</strong>  Patients with a prior history of manic symptoms should be referred for psychiatric evaluation prior to the institution of antidepressant therapy. Antidepressant therapy can trigger mania.</p><p><strong>11.</strong>  Continue treatment for 6–9 months <em>after</em> clinical recovery.</p><p><strong>12.</strong>  Patients with multiple recurrences (≥ 2–3) may require lifetime therapy.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Psychotherapy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Equally effective as pharmacotherapy in patients with mild to moderate depression. Options include cognitive behavioral therapy, problem-solving therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Less effective than pharmacotherapy in patients with severe depression. Combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be the best option.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Exercise programs may be helpful in older adults with mild to moderate depression.</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  Electroconvulsive therapy is an alternative therapy for patients with severe, refractory depression, particularly those with psychotic or suicidal features.</p><p><strong>I.</strong>  Indications for referral include psychotic features; substance abuse; panic disorder; agitated, severe, or relapsing depression; bipolar features; suicidality; and dysthymia.</p><p>Mrs. M reports no unusual stresses or losses.

He attributes this to his decreased appetite and decreased oral intake.</p><p>Since Mr. O’s weight loss is not obviously secondary to malabsorption, the focus turns to the third pivotal step, which differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure. Like many patients with weight loss Mr. O clearly notes a decreased oral intake and the evaluation focuses on the fourth pivotal step; a comprehensive, system-based approach utilizing a thorough history, (including a past medical history, detailed psychosocial history, and review of systems), physical exam, basic laboratory tests and completion of age-appropriate health maintenance examinations to search for diagnostic clues that will guide further evaluation.</p><p>Mr. O notes that he has a decreased appetite and feels full quickly after starting to eat. His past medical history is unremarkable as he has been well except for mild osteoarthritis of the knee. On psychosocial history, he reports that he has not felt down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month nor has he been bothered by a lack of interest in activities. He denies any changes at home and has no trouble obtaining food. He has never used tobacco and drinks 2 beers about once a month.</p><p>On review of systems, there are no fevers, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, heat intolerance, palpitations or tremulousness. There are also no GI symptoms of oral pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, or jaundice.</p><p>His medications include 600 mg of ibuprofen 2–3 times a day for mild osteoarthritis of his left knee. Physical exam reveals a thin but otherwise healthy appearing middle-aged man. Vital signs are normal. The remainder of his exam is completely normal.</p><p>Laboratory tests, including CBC with differential, hepatic panel, renal panel, urinalysis, CRP, ESR, and TSH, are normal. HIV and FOBT are negative. A chest radiograph is normal without mass or adenopathy.</p><p>The cause of Mr. O’s weight loss is not immediately obvious. However, his early satiety and NSAID use are clues that suggest peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis, or gastric cancer. You consider PUD your leading hypothesis. Gastric cancer is an alternative hypothesis, and colon cancer is a must not miss hypothesis given his change in bowel habits. Table 32-4 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 32-4.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. O.</p><p>All medications (prescription, over-the-counter and traditional/herbal) should be carefully scrutinized in patients complaining of unintentional weight loss.

This is clearly established by his history and a review of his medical records. The second step looks for symptoms suggestive of malabsorption and although he denies frank diarrhea, his large frequent stools raise the possibility of GI diseases associated with malabsorption. The third pivotal step differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure and the fourth (and pivotal) step reviews the history, physical exam, and laboratory studies to look for other clues that might suggest a diagnosis. Mr. A’s social history raises several possibilities. First, you suspect that his drinking is a problem and might be contributing to his weight loss. Alternatively, he may be more depressed than he acknowledges or simply adjusting to lifestyle changes precipitated by his separation. His difficult to flush stools also suggests one of a variety of causes of malabsorption.

He acknowledges that he tried to cut down while he was married, but since his separation, he no longer feels that restraint. He acknowledges that occasionally he hears funny stories about himself from these parties that he cannot recollect (amnesia). Mr. A also reluctantly reports that he received 2 citations for driving while intoxicated within the past year.

Options include topical preparations of 5-ASA or corticosteroids (suppositories, enemas, or foams) or oral 5-ASA preparations.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  More proximal or severe disease requires systemic therapy.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Therapy is also intensified in patients with severe disease manifested by greater stool frequency, increased bleeding, systemic symptoms (fever, tachycardia, anemia, elevated CRP, and elevated ESR) or sigmoidoscopic appearance.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Oral or systemic corticosteroids can be added for more severe disease or nonresponders.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Cyclosporine, 6MP, and infliximab have been effective in some patients with severe, corticosteroid-refractory disease.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Antibiotics may be useful in select ill patients, particularly those with toxic megacolon or peritonitis.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  5-ASA preparations (but not topical corticosteroids) are effective at maintaining remission. 6MP and infliximab can also be effective.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Surgery (colectomy) is curative. Indications include:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Patients with high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or cancer on surveillance colonoscopy. Low-grade dysplasia should also prompt consideration for colectomy.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Other severe complications including massive hemorrhage, perforation, and toxic megacolon.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Intractable disease</p><p><strong>H.</strong>  Adjuvant therapy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Persistent diarrhea</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Test for lactose intolerance.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Avoid fresh fruits, vegetables, and caffeine.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Surveillance colonoscopy for colon cancer for ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease begins 8 years after diagnosis and then every 1–2 years.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Supplemental iron</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Fish oils and nicotine (transdermal) have been demonstrated to induce remission in some patients.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Total parenteral nutrition if patients are unable to maintain adequate nutrition, but this is to be avoided when at all possible.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Antidiarrheals may <em>increase</em> the increased risk of toxic megacolon.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Screen patients who have been taking corticosteroids for > 3 months for osteoporosis and provide calcium and vitamin D supplementation.</p><a href=#case-resolution-3><h3 id=case-resolution-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CASE RESOLUTION</h3></a><p>Mr. A’s history and CT scan point strongly toward chronic pancreatitis.

Iron and vitamin deficiencies may be seen.</p><a href=#disease-highlights-9><h5 id=disease-highlights-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Occurs worldwide. Prevalence ≈ 0.5–1% in Northern Europeans; affects women 1.5 times more often than men.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Develops only in persons with either the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotype.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Develops in only a subset of such patients</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Those haplotypes expressed on antigen presenting cell surfaces can bind the deaminated gluten peptide found in wheat, rye, and barley.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  This triggers an abnormal immune response within the intestinal mucosa with subsequent mucosal injury, atrophy, and malabsorption.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Antibodies develop to gliadin, transglutaminase (tTG), and endomysin (EMA).</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Clinical manifestations</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Usually presents between ages 10 and 40 years, although may be recognized in older patients.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Symptoms precipitated by exposure to wheat, rye, or barley protein (gluten) and resolve within weeks to months on gluten-free diet.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Diarrhea is seen in 27–50% of patients. Patients may also have weight loss (6–22%), unexplained iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, aphthous stomatitis, or abnormal liver biochemical tests; however, they also may be asymptomatic.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Osteopenia and osteoporosis may develop due to vitamin D deficiency and subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Strongly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis in a minority of patients, which develops secondary to antibodies against epidermal transglutaminase.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Far more common in patients with trisomy 21.</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Increase risk of other autoimmune disorders including thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  Patients with celiac disease are at increased risk for intestinal adenocarcinoma and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma.</p><a href=#evidence-based-diagnosis-9><h5 id=evidence-based-diagnosis-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Evidence-Based Diagnosis</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Diagnostic options include duodenal biopsy (the gold standard), serology, and clinical response to a gluten-free diet.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Small bowel biopsy is the gold standard and useful but invasive. Strategies can help determine when biopsies are necessary.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Serologic testing is highly accurate but not perfect.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Tissue glutaminase antibody (IgA TTG)</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Very accurate: 90–98% sensitive, 95–97% specific; ≈ LR+ 24, LR– 0.06</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Simpler, cheaper, and less operator dependent than IgA EMA</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Initial test of choice</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Endomysial antibody (IgA EMA) also very accurate: 85–98% sensitive, 97–100% specific; LR+ 61, LR– 0.06.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  There are several causes of false-negative serologies, including</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  IgA deficiency: IgG TTG antibodies or deaminated gliadin peptide antibodies can be tested when the suspicion is high and IgA levels are low or absent.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Gluten-free diets: IgA TTG and IgA EMA levels fall (and may become negative) in patients on gluten-free diet. (Increasing titers in patients with celiac disease suggest dietary noncompliance.)</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  HLA typing</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Virtually all patients with celiac disease express HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 heterodimers.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  100% sensitive but only 57–75% specific</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  LR+, 2.3; LR−, 0</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Celiac disease can be virtually ruled out in patients who are negative for HLA-DQ2 or HAL-DQ8.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Maybe useful in patients who instituted a gluten-free diet before evaluation in whom IgA tTG and IgA EMA antibody levels may be low due to decreased disease activity. If the patient expressed neither HLA-DQ haplotype, celiac disease could be excluded.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Due to the low overall prevalence of celiac disease, positive EMA and tTG serologies do not confirm the diagnosis, despite their high specificity.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The positive predictive value ranges from 29% to 76% and small bowel biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  In contrast, negative EMA and tTG serologies make the diagnosis very unlikely (negative predictive value ≈ 99%) and essentially rule out the disease.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  If concern remains despite a negative result, HLA typing could help completely exclude the disease.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  One approach is shown in Figure 32-5.</p><p><strong>Figure 32-5.</strong> Diagnostic approach: celiac disease.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Certain patients complain of gluten-related symptoms and improvement on a gluten-free diet despite negative serologies and biopsy. Such patients may have an ill-defined gluten sensitivity.</p><a href=#treatment-9><h5 id=treatment-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Gluten-free diet (no wheat, rye, and barley)</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Oats that are uncontaminated with gluten are usually tolerated in patients with celiac disease.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Lactose avoidance may be necessary due to concomitant lactase deficiency.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Correct iron, folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin D deficiencies.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended by some experts.</p><p><strong>F.</strong>  Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressives have rarely been necessary in patients with refractory celiac disease.</p><p><strong>G.</strong>  Osteoporosis screening is recommended.</p><a href=#references><h3 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>REFERENCES</h3></a><p>American Psychiatric Association. <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, 5th ed.
