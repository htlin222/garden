We report the final analysis from our study of the immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab versus chemotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n### Methods\nWe did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (ATTRACTION-3) at 90 hospitals and cancer centres in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. We enrolled patients aged 20 years and older with unresectable advanced or recurrent oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (regardless of PD-L1 expression), at least one measurable or non-measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, and who were refractory or intolerant to one previous fluoropyrimidine-based and platinum-based chemotherapy and had a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either nivolumab (240 mg for 30 min every 2 weeks) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 for at least 60 min once per week for 6 weeks then 1 week off; or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 for at least 60 min every 3 weeks), all given intravenously. Treatment continued until disease progression assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was done using an interactive web response system with a block size of four and stratified according to geographical region (Japan vs rest of the world), number of organs with metastases, and PD-L1 expression. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation until death from any cause, in the intention-to-treat population that included all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02569242, and follow-up for long-term outcomes is ongoing.\n### Findings\nBetween Jan 7, 2016, and May 25, 2017, we assigned 419 patients to treatment: 210 to nivolumab and 209 to chemotherapy. At the time of data cutoff on Nov 12, 2018, median follow-up for overall survival was 10·5 months (IQR 4·5–19·0) in the nivolumab group and 8·0 months (4·6–15·2) in the chemotherapy group. At a minimum follow-up time (ie, time from random assignment of the last patient to data cutoff) of 17·6 months, overall survival was significantly improved in the nivolumab group compared with the chemotherapy group (median 10·9 months, 95% CI 9·2–13·3 vs 8·4 months, 7·2–9·9; hazard ratio for death 0·77, 95% CI 0·62–0·96; p=0·019). 38 (18%) of 209 patients in the nivolumab group had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events compared with 131 (63%) of 208 patients in the chemotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were anaemia (four [2%]) in the nivolumab group and decreased neutrophil count (59 [28%]) in the chemotherapy group. Five deaths were deemed treatment-related: two in the nivolumab group (one each of interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy group (one each of pneumonia, spinal cord abscess, and interstitial lung disease).\n### Interpretation\nNivolumab was associated with a significant improvement in overall survivaland a favourable safety profile compared with chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and might represent a new standard second-line treatment option for these patients.\n### Funding\nONO Pharmaceutical Company and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.240189955Z","tags":null},"/AV-Block":{"title":"AV Block","content":"# AV Block\n\n\n (Circ 2019;140:e382)\nType Features\n## 1°\nProlonged PR (\u003e200 ms), all atrial impulses conducted (1:1).\n## 2° Mobitz I (Wenckebach)\nProgressive ↑ PR until impulse not conducted (→ ”grouped beating”).\nAV node pathology: ischemia (IMI), inflammation (myocarditis, endocarditis, MV surgery), high vagal tone (athletes), drug induced.\nClassically (~50%), absolute ↑ in PR decreases over time (→ ↓ RR intervals, duration of pause \u003c2× preceding RR interval); nl QRS.\nAVB usually worsens w/ carotid sinus massage, improves w/ atropine.\nOften paroxysmal/nocturnal/asx, no Rx required.\n## 2° Mobitz II\nBlocked impulses w/ consistent PR interval, often prolonged QRS\nHis-Purkinje pathology: ischemia (AMI), degeneration of conduction system, infiltrative disease, inflammation.\nAVB may improve w/ carotid sinus massage, may worsen w/ atropine.\nMay progress to 3° AVB.

Cardiac procedural myocardial injury is arbitrarily defined by increases of cTn values (\u003e99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values \u003e20% of the baseline value when it is above the 99th percentile, but it is stable or falling.\n2.  Coronary intervention-related MI is arbitrarily defined by elevation of cTn values **\\\u003e5** times the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values. In patients with elevated pre-procedure cTn in whom the cTn levels are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, the post-procedure cTn must rise by \u003e20%. However, the absolute post-procedural value must still be at least five times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required:\n\n3.  New ischemic ECG changes;\n4.  Development of new pathological Q waves;\n5.  Angiographic findings consistent with a procedural flow-limiting complication such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery or a side branch occlusion/thrombus, disruption of collateral flow or distal embolization.\n\n6.  [[Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related MI]]\n\n7.  Development of new pathological Q waves;\n8.  Angiographic documented new graft occlusion or new native coronary artery occlusion;\n9.  Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology.\n\n10.  It is increasingly recognized that there is a group of MI patients with no angiographic obstructive coronary artery disease (≥50% diameter stenosis in a major epicardial vessel), and the term “myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA)” has been coined for this entity.\n11.  Patients may have elevated cTn values and marked decreases in ejection fraction due to sepsis caused by endotoxin, with myocardial function recovering completely with normal ejection fraction once the sepsis is treated.\n12.  Arriving at a diagnosis of MI using the criteria set forth in this document requires integration of clinical findings, patterns on the ECG, laboratory data, observations from imaging procedures, and on occasion pathological findings, all viewed in the context of the time horizon over which the suspected event unfolds.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.256191153Z","tags":null},"/Fresh-H2O-soft-tissue-infections":{"title":"Fresh H2O soft tissue infections","content":"# Fresh H2O soft tissue infections\n\nAeromonas\nMyonecrosis/rhabdo can occur.\nFQ, TMP-SMX, or CTX\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.256191153Z","tags":null},"/Fresh-frozen-plasma":{"title":"Fresh frozen plasma","content":"# Fresh frozen plasma\n\nContains all coagulation factors.

Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and in all patients (one-sided α 0.9%, 0.8%, and 0.8%, respectively).\n\nResults: At final analysis, conducted 16 months after the last patient was randomly assigned, OS was prolonged with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for patients with CPS ≥ 10 (median, 9.3 v 6.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93]; P = .0074). Estimated 12-month OS rate was 43% (95% CI, 33.5% to 52.1%) with pembrolizumab versus 20% (95% CI, 13.5% to 28.3%) with chemotherapy.

Each of these genes provides instructions for making a piece (subunit) of a protein complex called the [[epithelial sodium channel - ENaC]]. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, where the channels transport sodium into cells.\n\nMutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene change the structure of the respective ENaC subunit. \nThe changes alter a region of the subunit that is involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation) when it is no longer needed. As a result of the mutations, the subunit proteins are not degraded, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium (followed by water), which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.264191753Z","tags":null},"/Lidocaine":{"title":"Lidocaine","content":"# Lidocaine\n\n1.0~1.5mg/kg 2% 50kg 75mg 胖一點的100mg\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.264191753Z","tags":null},"/Likelihood-of-ACS-Circ-2007-116-e148-Circ-1994-90-1-613-22":{"title":"Likelihood of ACS  Circ 2007 116 e148  Circ 1994 90 1  613 22","content":"# Likelihood of ACS  Circ 2007 116 e148  Circ 1994 90 1  613 22 \n\n| Feature    | High (any of below)                                      | Intermediate (no high features, any of below) | Low (no high/inter. features, may have below)         |\n| History    | Chest or L arm pain like prior angina, h/o CAD (incl MI) | Chest or arm pain, age \u003e70 y, male, diabetes  | Atypical sx (eg, pleuritic, sharp or positional pain) |\n| Exam       | HoTN, diaphoresis, HF, transient MR                      | PAD or cerebrovascular disease                | Pain reproduced on palp.                              |\n| ECG        | New STD (≥1 mm) TWI in mult leads                        | Old Qw, STD (0.5-0.9 mm), TWI (\u003e1 mm)         | TWF/TWI (\u003c1 mm) in leads w/ dominant R wave           |\n| Biomarkers | ⊕ Tn or CK-MB                                            | Normal                                        | Normal                                                |\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.264191753Z","tags":null},"/Lithium-toxicology":{"title":"Lithium-toxicology","content":"# Lithium-toxicology\n\n\nN/V/D, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, drowsiness, seizure, ↑ QT, AV block, bradycardia\n\nIVF (NS), maintain UOP\n\nConsider hemodialysis\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.264191753Z","tags":null},"/Localization-of-MI":{"title":"Localization of MI","content":"# Localization of MI\n\n| Anatomic Area | ECG Leads w/ STE                                                           | Coronary Artery         |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Septal        | V1–V2 ± aVR                                                                | Proximal LAD            |\n| Anterior      | V3–V4                                                                      | LAD                     |\n| Apical        | V5–V6                                                                      | Distal LAD, LCx, or RCA |\n| Lateral       | I, aVL                                                                     | LCx                     |\n| Inferior      | II, III, aVF ± aVR                                                         | RCA (~85%), LCx (~15%)  |\n| RV            | V1–V2 \u0026 V4R (most Se)                                                      | Proximal RCA            |\n| Posterior     | ST depression V1–V3 (= STE V7–V9 posterior leads, ✓ if clinical suspicion) | RCA or LCx              |\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.264191753Z","tags":null},"/Long-term-anticoagulation-options-venous-thromboembolism":{"title":"Long-term anticoagulation options-venous thromboembolism","content":"# Long-term anticoagulation options-venous thromboembolism\n\n* For nonpregnant Pt without severe renal dysfunction or active cancer → DOAC\n\n* For severe renal insufficiency or APLAS → warfarin.

SCLC is less common but more aggressive, and it accounts for the remaining 15 percent of lung cancers.\n\nLung cancer can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments. The type of treatment that is best for a particular person depends on the stage of the lung cancer (how far it has spread), the person’s overall health, and other factors.\n\nThere are many different treatments for lung cancer, depending on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the person's overall health and preferences. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. \n\nOpenAI 是什麼？ \nOpenAI 是一個非營利的人工智慧研究公司，由 SpaceX、Y Combinator 創始人之一的多萝西·波拉德（Doris Salcedo Polanco）、《黑客与画家》作者彼得·考夫曼（Peter Thiel）、Greg Brockman、Reid Hoffman、Shakil Khan 以及 Mike Seibert 等人共同創立。\n\nOpenAI 的目標是「協助人類理解並控制人工智慧」。\n\nOpenAI 成立於 2015 年 12 月，自成立以來已經籌集了 6 億美元的資金。2017 年 1 月，Elon Musk 宣布將透過 Tesla 投資 1 億美元加入 OpenAI。\n\nWhat is EGFR mutation?\n\nEGFR mutation is a type of genetic mutation that can occur in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor, which is found on the surface of cells. The EGFR protein is involved in signaling pathways that control cell growth and division. Mutations in the EGFR gene can cause abnormally high activity of the EGFR protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.268192052Z","tags":null},"/Ophthalmologic-complications-of-HIV-AIDS":{"title":"Ophthalmologic-complications of HIV AIDS","content":"# Ophthalmologic-complications of HIV AIDS\n\n\n* CMV retinitis (CD4 usu \u003c50); Rx: ganciclovir or valganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir\n* HZV, VZV, syphilis (any CD4 count, treat as neurosyphilis) or Toxo (CD4 usually \u003c100)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.268192052Z","tags":null},"/Opioids-toxicology":{"title":"Opioids-toxicology","content":"# Opioids-toxicology\n\n\n↓ mentation, ↓ RR, miosis\n\nIV naloxone\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.268192052Z","tags":null},"/Optimal-medical-therapy-stable-ischemic-heart-disease":{"title":"Optimal-medical-therapy-stable ischemic heart disease","content":"# Optimal-medical-therapy-stable ischemic heart disease\n\n* ASA 75–162 mg/d; can substitute clopi if ASA-intolerant. ~12 mos after PCI, clopi monoRx ↓ risk of ischemic and bleeding events by ~30% c/w ASA monoRx (Lancet 2021;397:2487).\n* βB for 3 years post-MI or if ↓ EF; can consider in all Pts w/ SIHD\n* ACEI (or ARB if intolerant of ACEI) if HTN, DM, CKD, or ↓ EF (Lancet 2006;368:581)\n* Dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA + P2Y12 inhibitor): ↓ CV events by ~10% in Pts with known IHD w/o MI but w/ DM, but ↑ bleeding (THEMIS, NEJM 2019; 381:1309)\n* Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + ASA 100 mg/d: 24% ↓ CV events and 18% ↓ death vs. ASA alone, but ↑ major bleeding in stable ASCVD (COMPASS, NEJM 2017;377:1319)\n* Colchicine (0.5 mg/d): ↓ CV events by 31%, but ? ↑ non-CV death (NEJM 2020;383:1838)\n\nMedical therapies for symptomatic relief (Circ 2014;130:1749)\n\n* Beta-blockers 1st-line therapy; CCB (except short-acting dihydropyridines)\n* Long-acting nitrates\n* Ranolazine (↓ late inward Na+ current to ↓ myocardial demand): 2nd-line anti-anginal\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.268192052Z","tags":null},"/Oral-anticoagulation-atrial-fibrillation":{"title":"Oral anticoagulation-atrial fibrillation","content":"# Oral anticoagulation-atrial fibrillation\n\n (Circ 2014;130:e199 \u0026 2019;140:125; EHJ 2021;42:373)\n* All valvular AF because stroke risk very high\n* Nonvalvular AF (NVAF): stroke risk ~4.5%/y but varies; a/c → 68% ↓ stroke but ↑ bleeding\n* [[CHA2DS2-VASc]] to guide Rx:\n## Score Points\n* score \u003e=2 in ♂ or \u003e=3 in ♀→ anticoagulate;\n* scores 1 in ♂ or 2 in ♀ → consider anticoag or ASA or no Rx;\n* score 0 → reasonable to not Rx\n## Treatment options\n* Rx options: DOAC (NVAF only) prefered over warfarin (INR 2–3); if Pt refuses anticoag, ASA + clopi or, even less effective, ASA alone (NEJM 2009;360:2066)\n* AF + CAD/ PCI: consider DOAC + clopi (not ticag or prasugrel) + ASA (d/c ~1–4 wks) (Circ 2021;143:583); consider DOAC only after 12 mos (JACC 2021;77:629)\n* If concern for procedural bleed, interrupt OAC (1–2 d DOAC, 4–5 d VKA).

In the care of the suffering, [the physician] needs technical skill, scientific knowledge, and human understanding. Tact, sympathy, and understanding are expected of the physician, for the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered functions, damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. [The patient] is human, fearful, and hopeful, seeking relief, help, and reassurance. —Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine, 1950 \n\nThe practice of medicine has changed in significant ways since the first edition of this book was published in 1950. The advent of molecular genetics, sophisticated new imaging techniques, robotics, and advances in bioinformatics and information technology have contributed to an explosion of scientific information that has changed fundamentally the way physicians define, diagnose, treat, and attempt to prevent disease. This growth of scientific knowledge continues to evolve at an accelerated pace. The widespread use of electronic medical records and the Internet have altered the way physicians and other health care providers access and exchange information as a routine part of medical education and practice **(Fig. 1-1)**. As today’s physicians strive to integrate an everexpanding body of scientific knowledge into everyday practice, it is critically important to remember two key principles: first, the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and, when it occurs, to diagnose it early and provide effective treatment; and second, despite 70 years of scientific advances since the first edition of this text, a trusting relationship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of effective patient care. \n\n#### ■ THE SCIENCE AND ART OF MEDICINE \n\nDeductive reasoning and applied technology form the foundation for the approach and solution to many clinical problems. Extraordinary advances in biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, and genomics, \n\n coupled with newly developed imaging techniques, provide a window into the most remote recesses of the body and allow access to the innermost parts of the cell. Revelations about the nature of genes and single cells have opened a portal for formulating a new molecular basis for the physiology of systems. Researchers are deciphering the complex mechanisms by which genes are regulated, and increasingly, physicians are learning how subtle changes in many different genes, acting in an integrative contextual way, can affect the function of cells and organisms. Clinicians have developed a new appreciation of the role of stem cells in normal tissue function, in the development of cancer and other disorders, and in the treatment of certain diseases. Entirely new areas of research, including studies of the human microbiome, epigenetics, and noncoding RNAs as regulatory features of the genome, have become important for understanding both health and disease. Information technology enables the interrogation of medical records from millions of individuals, yielding new insights into the etiology, characteristics, prognosis, and stratification of many diseases. With the increasing availability of very large data sets (“big data”) from omic analyses and the electronic medical record, there is now a growing need for machine learning and artificial intelligence for unbiased analyses that enhance clinical predictive accuracy. The knowledge gleaned from the science of medicine continues to enhance the understanding by physicians of complex pathologic processes and to provide new approaches to disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. With continued refinement of unique omic signatures coupled with nuanced clinical pathophenotypes, the profession moves ever closer to practical precision medicine. Yet, skill in the most sophisticated applications of laboratory technology and in the use of the latest therapeutic modality alone does not make a good physician. Extraordinary advances in vaccine platform technology and the use of cryo-electron microscopy for the structure-based design of vaccine immunogens have transformed the field of vaccinology, resulting in the unprecedented speed and success with which COVID-19 vaccines were developed. When a patient poses challenging clinical problems, an effective physician must be able to identify the crucial elements in a complex history and physical examination; order the appropriate laboratory, imaging, and diagnostic tests; and extract the key results from densely populated computer screens to determine whether to treat or to “watch.” As the number of tests increases, so does the likelihood that some incidental finding, completely unrelated to the clinical problem at hand, will be uncovered. Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth pursuing or should be dismissed as a “red herring” and weighing whether a proposed test, preventive measure, or treatment entails a greater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled clinician must make many times each day. This combination of medical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of medicine , which is as necessary to the practice of medicine and the precision medicine of the future as is a sound scientific base, and as important for contemporary medical practice as it has been in earlier eras. \n\n#### ■ CLINICAL SKILLS \n\n#### History-Taking The recorded history of an illness should include \n\n all the facts of medical significance in the life of the patient. Recent events should be given the most attention. Patients should, at some early point, have the opportunity to tell their own story of the illness without frequent interruption and, when appropriate, should receive expressions of interest, encouragement, and empathy from the physician. Any event related by a patient, however trivial or seemingly irrelevant, may provide the key to solving the medical problem. A methodical review of systems is important to elicit features of an underlying disease that might not be mentioned in the patient’s narrative. In general, patients who feel comfortable with the physician will offer more complete information; thus, putting the patient at ease contributes substantially to obtaining an adequate history. \n\n**FIGURE 1-1 The Doctor by Luke Fildes depicts the caring relationship** between this Victorian physician and a very ill child. Painted in 1891, the painting reflects the death of the painter’s young son from typhoid fever and was intended to reflect the compassionate care provided by the physician even when his tools were not able to influence the course of disease. (Source: History and Art Collection/Alamy Stock Photo.) \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n An informative history is more than eliciting an orderly listing of symptoms. By listening to patients and noting the ways in which they describe their symptoms, physicians can gain valuable insight. Inflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude (i.e., “body language”) may offer important clues to patients’ perception of and reaction to their symptoms. Because patients vary considerably in their medical sophistication and ability to recall facts, the reported medical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The social history also can provide important insights into the types of diseases that should be considered and can identify practical considerations for subsequent management. The family history not only identifies rare genetic disorders or common exposures, but often reveals risk factors for common disorders, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, autoimmunity, and asthma. A thorough family history may require input from multiple relatives to ensure completeness and accuracy. An experienced clinician can usually formulate a relevant differential diagnosis from the history alone, using the physical examination and diagnostic tests to narrow the list or reveal unexpected findings that lead to more focused inquiry. The very act of eliciting the history provides the physician with an opportunity to establish or enhance a unique bond that can form the basis for a good patient–physician relationship. This process helps the physician develop an appreciation of the patient’s view of the illness, the patient’s expectations of the physician and the health care system, and the financial and social implications of the illness for the patient. Although current health care settings may impose time constraints on patient visits, it is important not to rush the encounter. A hurried approach may lead patients to believe that what they are relating is not of importance to the physician, and, as a result, they may withhold relevant information. The confidentiality of the patient–physician relationship cannot be overemphasized. \n\n#### Physical Examination The purpose of the physical examination is \n\n to identify physical signs of disease. The significance of these objective indications of disease is enhanced when they confirm a functional or structural change already suggested by the patient’s history. At times, however, physical signs may be the only evidence of disease and may not have been suggested by the history. The physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with consideration given to the patient’s comfort and modesty. Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited—not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Physical examination skills should be learned under direct observation of experienced clinicians. Even highly experienced clinicians can benefit from ongoing coaching and feedback. Simulation laboratories and standardized patients play an increasingly important role in the development of clinical skills. Although the skills of physical diagnosis are acquired with experience, it is not merely technique that determines success in identifying signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers, but of a mind alert to those findings. Because physical findings can change with time, the physical examination should be repeated as frequently as the clinical situation warrants. Given the many highly sensitive diagnostic tests now available (particularly imaging techniques), it may be tempting to place less emphasis on the physical examination. Some are critical of physical diagnosis based on perceived low levels of specificity and sensitivity. Indeed, many patients are seen by consultants only after a series of diagnostic tests have been performed and the results are known. This fact should not deter the physician from performing a thorough physical examination since important clinical findings may have escaped detection by diagnostic tests. Especially important, a thorough and thoughtful physical examination may render a laboratory finding unimportant (i.e., certain echocardiographic regurgitant lesions). The act of a hands-on examination of the patient also offers an opportunity \n\n for communication and may have reassuring effects that foster the patient–physician relationship. \n\n#### Diagnostic Studies Physicians rely increasingly on a wide array \n\n of laboratory and imaging tests to make diagnoses and ultimately to solve clinical problems; however, such information does not relieve the physician from the responsibility of carefully observing and examining the patient. It is also essential to appreciate the limitations of diagnostic tests. By virtue of their apparent precision, these tests often gain an aura of certainty regardless of the fallibility of the tests themselves, the instruments used in the tests, and the individuals performing or interpreting the tests. Physicians must weigh the expense involved in laboratory procedures against the value of the information these procedures are likely to provide. Single laboratory tests are rarely ordered. Instead, physicians generally request “batteries” of multiple tests, which often prove useful and can be performed with a single specimen at relatively low cost. For example, abnormalities of hepatic function may provide the clue to nonspecific symptoms such as generalized weakness and increased fatigability, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic liver disease. Sometimes a single abnormality, such as an elevated serum calcium level, points to a particular disease, such as hyperparathyroidism. The thoughtful use of screening tests (e.g., measurement of lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol) may allow early intervention to prevent disease (Chap. 6). Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases and when their results indicate whether other potentially useful—but often costly—tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as routine serum chemistries, blood counts, and urinalysis, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is often wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed routinely for screening purposes, it is not unusual for one or two values to be slightly abnormal. Nevertheless, even if there is no reason to suspect an underlying illness, tests yielding abnormal results ordinarily are repeated to rule out laboratory error. If an abnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential significance in the context of the patient’s condition and other test results. There is almost continual development of technically improved imaging studies with greater sensitivity and specificity. These tests provide remarkably detailed anatomic information that can be pivotal in informing medical decision-making. MRI, CT, ultrasonography, a variety of isotopic scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) have supplanted older, more invasive approaches and opened new diagnostic vistas. In light of their capabilities and the rapidity with which they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of imaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which imaging studies revealed findings that led to an unexpected diagnosis. Nonetheless, patients must endure each of these tests, and the added cost of unnecessary testing is substantial. Furthermore, investigation of an unexpected abnormal finding may lead to an iatrogenic complication or to the diagnosis of an irrelevant or incidental problem. A skilled physician must learn to use these powerful diagnostic tools judiciously, always considering whether the results will alter management and benefit the patient. \n\n#### ■ MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT CARE \n\n#### Team-Based Care Medical practice has long involved teams, \n\n particularly physicians working with nurses and, more recently, with physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Advances in medicine have increased our ability to manage very complex clinical situations (e.g., intensive care units [ICUs], bone marrow transplantation) and have shifted the burden of disease toward chronic illnesses. Because an individual patient may have multiple chronic diseases, he or she may be cared for by several specialists as well as a primary care physician. In the inpatient setting, care may involve multiple consultants along with \n\n---\n\n#### The Practice of Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 1 \n\nthe primary admitting physician. Communication through the medical record is necessary but not sufficient, particularly when patients have complex medical problems or when difficult decisions need to be made about the optimal management plan. Physicians should optimally meet face-to-face or by phone to ensure clear communication and thoughtful planning. It is important to note that patients often receive or perceive different messages from various care providers; thus, attempts should be made to provide consistency among these messages to the patient. Management plans and treatment options should be outlined succinctly and clearly for the patient. Another dimension of team-based care involves allied health professions. It is not unusual for a hospitalized patient to encounter physical therapists, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, radiology technicians, social workers, dieticians, and transport personnel (among others) in addition to physicians and nurses. Each of these individuals contributes to clinical care as well as to the patient’s experience with the health care system. In the outpatient setting, disease screening and chronic disease management are often carried out by nurses, physician assistants, or other allied health professionals. The growth of team-based care has important implications for medical culture, student and resident training, and the organization of health care systems. Despite diversity in training, skills, and responsibilities among health care professionals, common values need to be espoused and reinforced. Many medical schools have incorporated interprofessional teamwork into their curricula. Effective communication is inevitably the most challenging aspect of implementing teambased care. While communication can be aided by electronic devices, including medical records, apps, or text messages, it is vitally important to balance efficiency with taking the necessary time to speak directly with colleagues. \n\n#### The Dichotomy of Inpatient and Outpatient Internal \n\n#### Medicine The hospital environment has undergone sweeping \n\nchanges over the past few decades. Emergency departments and critical care units have evolved to manage critically ill patients, allowing them to survive formerly fatal conditions. In parallel, there is increasing pressure to reduce the length of stay in the hospital and to manage complex disorders in the outpatient setting. This transition has been driven not only by efforts to reduce costs but also by the availability of new outpatient technologies, such as imaging and percutaneous infusion catheters for long-term antibiotics or nutrition, minimally invasive surgical procedures, and evidence that outcomes often are improved by reducing inpatient hospitalization. In addition to traditional medical beds, hospitals now encompass multiple distinct levels of care, such as the emergency department, procedure rooms, overnight observation units, critical care units, and palliative care units. A consequence of this differentiation has been the emergence of new specialties (e.g., emergency medicine and endof-life care) and the provision of in-hospital care by hospitalists and intensivists. Most hospitalists are board-certified internists who bear primary responsibility for the care of hospitalized patients and whose work is limited entirely to the hospital setting. The shortened length of hospital stay means that most patients receive only acute care while hospitalized; the increased complexities of inpatient medicine make the presence of an internist with specific training, skills, and experience in the hospital environment extremely beneficial. Intensivists are board-certified physicians who are further certified in critical care medicine and who direct and provide care for very ill patients in critical care units. Clearly, an important challenge in internal medicine today is to ensure the continuity of communication and information flow between a patient’s primary care physician and those who are in charge of the patient’s hospital care. Maintaining these channels of communication is frequently complicated by patient “handoffs”—i.e., transitions from the outpatient to the inpatient environment, from the critical care unit to a general medicine floor, from a medical to a surgical service and vice versa, from the hospital environment to the recently developed “home hospital” setting (for select patients with adequate home support), and from the hospital or home hospital to the outpatient environment. \n\n The involvement of many care providers in conjunction with these transitions can threaten the traditional one-to-one relationship between patient and primary care physician. Of course, patients can benefit greatly from effective collaboration among a number of health care professionals; however, it is the duty of the patient’s principal or primary physician to provide cohesive guidance through an illness. To meet this challenge, primary care physicians must be familiar with the techniques, skills, and objectives of specialist physicians and allied health professionals who care for their patients in the hospital. In addition, primary care physicians must ensure that their patients benefit from scientific advances and the expertise of specialists, both in and out of the hospital. Primary care physicians should explain the role of these specialists to reassure patients that they are in the hands of physicians best trained to manage their current illness. However, the primary care physician should assure patients and their families that decisions are being made in consultation with these specialists. The evolving concept of the “medical home” incorporates team-based primary care with subspecialty care in a cohesive environment that ensures smooth transitions of care. \n\n#### Mitigating the Stress of Acute Illness Few people are prepared \n\n for a new diagnosis of cancer or anticipate the occurrence of a myocardial infarction, stroke, or major accident. The care of a frightened or distraught patient is confounded by these understandable responses to life-threatening events. The physician and other health providers can reduce the shock of life-changing events by providing information in a clear, calm, consistent, and reassuring manner. Often, information and reassurance need to be repeated. Caregivers should also recognize that, for the typical patient, hospital emergency rooms, operating rooms, ICUs, and general medical floors represent an intimidating environment. Hospitalized patients find themselves surrounded by air jets, buttons, and glaring lights; invaded by tubes and wires; and beset by the numerous members of the health care team—hospitalists, specialists, nurses, nurses’ aides, physician assistants, social workers, technologists, physical therapists, medical students, house officers, attending and consulting physicians, and many others. They may be transported to special laboratories and imaging facilities replete with blinking lights, strange sounds, and unfamiliar personnel; they may be left unattended at times; and they may be obligated to share a room with other patients who have their own health problems. It is little wonder that patients may find this environment bewildering and stressful. The additive effects of an acute illness, unfamiliar environment, multiple medications, and sleep deprivation can lead to confusion or delirium, especially in older hospitalized patients. Physicians who appreciate the hospital experience from the patient’s perspective and who make an effort to guide the patient through this experience may make a stressful situation more tolerable and enhance the patient’s chances for an optimal recovery. \n\n#### Medical Decision-Making Medical decision-making is a fun\n\n damental responsibility of the physician and occurs at each stage of the diagnostic and therapeutic process. The decision-making process involves the ordering of additional tests, requests for consultations, decisions about treatment, and predictions concerning prognosis. This process requires an in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of disease. Formulating a differential diagnosis requires not only a broad knowledge base but also the ability to assess the relative probabilities of various diseases for a given patient. Application of the scientific method, including hypothesis formulation and data collection, is essential to the process of accepting or rejecting a particular diagnosis. Analysis of the differential diagnosis is an iterative process. As new information or test results are acquired, the group of disease processes being considered can be contracted or expanded appropriately. Whenever possible, decisions should be evidence-based, taking advantage of rigorously designed clinical trials or objective comparisons of different diagnostic tests. Evidence-based medicine stands in sharp contrast to anecdotal experience, which is often biased. Unless attuned to the importance of using larger, objective studies for making decisions, even the most experienced physicians can be influenced \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n to an undue extent by recent encounters with selected patients. Evidence-based medicine has become an increasingly important part of routine medical practice and has led to the publication of many useful practice guidelines. It is important to remember, however, that only a small fraction of the many decisions made in clinical practice are based on rigorous clinical trial evidence; other guideline recommendations are, therefore, predicated on expert consensus and weaker evidentiary support. Thus, the importance of evidence-based medicine notwithstanding, much medical decision-making still relies on good clinical judgment, an attribute that is difficult to quantify or even to assess qualitatively. Physicians must use their knowledge and experience as a basis for weighing known factors, along with the inevitable uncertainties, and then making a sound judgment; this synthesis of information is particularly important when a relevant evidence base is not available. Several quantitative tools may be invaluable in synthesizing the available information, including diagnostic tests, Bayes’ theorem (the probability of an event predicated on prior knowledge of conditions possibly related to the event), and multivariate statistical models (Chap. 4). Diagnostic tests serve to reduce uncertainty about an individual’s diagnosis or prognosis and help the physician decide how best to manage that individual’s condition. The battery of diagnostic tests complements the history and physical examination. The accuracy of a particular test is ascertained by determining its sensitivity (true-positive rate) and specificity (true-negative rate), as well as the predictive value of a positive and a negative result. See Chap. 4 for a more thorough discussion of decision-making in clinical medicine. \n\n#### Practice Guidelines Many professional organizations and govern\n\n ment agencies have developed formal clinical-practice guidelines to aid physicians and other caregivers in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions that are evidence-based, cost-effective, and most appropriate to a particular patient and clinical situation. As the evidence base of medicine increases, guidelines can provide a useful framework for managing patients with particular diagnoses or symptoms. Clinical guidelines can protect patients—particularly those with inadequate health care benefits—from receiving substandard care. These guidelines also can protect conscientious caregivers from inappropriate charges of malpractice and society from the excessive costs associated with the overuse of medical resources. There are, however, caveats associated with clinical-practice guidelines since they tend to oversimplify the complexities of medicine. Furthermore, groups with different perspectives may develop divergent recommendations regarding issues as basic as the need for screening of women by mammography or of men with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements. Finally, guidelines, as the term implies, do not—and cannot be expected to—account for the uniqueness of each individual and his or her illness. The physician’s challenge is to integrate into clinical practice the useful recommendations offered by experts without accepting them blindly or being inappropriately constrained by them. \n\n#### Precision Medicine The concept of precision or personalized \n\n medicine reflects the growing recognition that diseases once lumped together can be further stratified on the basis of genetic, biomarker, phenotypic, and/or psychosocial characteristics that distinguish a given patient from other patients with similar clinical presentations. Inherent in this concept is the goal of targeting therapies in a more specific way to improve clinical outcomes for the individual patient and minimize unnecessary side effects for those less likely to respond to a particular treatment. In some respects, precision medicine represents the evolution of clinical practice guidelines, which are usually developed for populations of patients or a particular diagnosis (e.g., hypertension, thyroid nodule). As the pathobiology, prognosis, and treatment responses of subgroups within these diagnoses become better understood (i.e., through refined genomic analysis or enhanced deep phenotyping), the relevant clinical guidelines incorporate progressively more refined recommendations for individuals within these subgroups. The role of precision medicine is best illustrated for cancers in which genetic testing is able to predict responses (or the lack thereof ) to \n\n targeted therapies (Chap. 73). One can anticipate similar applications of precision medicine in pharmacogenomics, immunologic disorders, and diseases in which biomarkers can predict treatment responses. See Chap. 5 for a more thorough discussion of precision medicine. \n\n#### Evaluation of Outcomes Clinicians generally use objective and \n\n readily measurable parameters to judge the outcome of a therapeutic intervention. These measures may oversimplify the complexity of a clinical condition as patients often present with a major clinical problem in the context of multiple complicating background illnesses. For example, a patient may present with chest pain and cardiac ischemia, but with a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal insufficiency. For this reason, outcome measures, such as mortality, length of hospital stay, or readmission rates, are typically riskadjusted. An important point to remember is that patients usually seek medical attention for subjective reasons; they wish to obtain relief from pain, to preserve or regain function, and to enjoy life. The components of a patient’s health status or quality of life can include bodily comfort, capacity for physical activity, personal and professional function, sexual function, cognitive function, and overall perception of health. Each of these important domains can be assessed through structured interviews or specially designed questionnaires. Such assessments provide useful parameters by which a physician can judge patients’ subjective views of their disabilities and responses to treatment, particularly in chronic illness. The practice of medicine requires consideration and integration of both objective and subjective outcomes. Many health systems use survey and patient feedback data to assess qualitative features such as patient satisfaction, access to care, and communication with nurses and physicians. In the United States, HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) surveys are used by many systems and are publicly reported. Social media is also being used to assess feedback in real time as well as to share patient experiences with health care systems, potentially enriching the information available for use in medical decisions. \n\n#### Errors in the Delivery of Health Care A series of reports from \n\n the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) called for an ambitious agenda to reduce medical error rates and improve patient safety by designing and implementing fundamental changes in health care systems (Chap. 8). It is the responsibility of hospitals and health care organizations to develop systems to reduce risk and ensure patient safety. Medication errors can be reduced through the use of ordering systems that rely on electronic processes or, when electronic options are not available, that eliminate misreading of handwriting. Whatever the clinical situation, it is the physician’s responsibility to use powerful therapeutic measures wisely, with due regard for their beneficial actions, potential dangers, and cost. Implementation of infection control systems, enforcement of hand-washing protocols, and careful oversight of antibiotic use can minimize the complications of nosocomial infections. Central-line infection rates and catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been dramatically reduced at many centers by careful adherence of trained personnel to standardized protocols for introducing and maintaining central lines and urinary catheters, respectively. Rates of surgical infection and wrong-site surgery can likewise be reduced by the use of standardized protocols and checklists. Falls by patients can be minimized by judicious use of sedatives and appropriate assistance with bed-to-chair and bed-to-bathroom transitions. Taken together, these and other measures are saving thousands of lives each year. \n\n#### Electronic Medical Records Both the growing reliance on \n\n computers and the strength of information technology now play central roles in medicine, including efforts to reduce medical errors. Laboratory data are accessed almost universally through computers. Many medical centers now have electronic medical records (EMRs), computerized order entry, and bar-coded tracking of medications. Some of these systems are interactive, sending reminders or warning of potential medical errors. EMRs offer rapid access to information that is invaluable in enhancing health care quality and patient safety, including relevant data, \n\n---\n\n#### The Practice of Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 1 \n\nhistorical and clinical information, imaging studies, laboratory results, and medication records. These data can be used to monitor and reduce unnecessary variations in care and to provide real-time information about processes of care and clinical outcomes. Ideally, patient records are easily transferred across the health care system; however, technological limitations and concerns about privacy and cost continue to limit broad-based use of EMRs in many clinical settings. For all of the advantages of EMRs, they can create distance between the physician and patient if care is not taken to preserve face-to-face contact. EMRs also require training and time for data entry. Many providers spend significant time entering information to generate structured data and to meet billing requirements. They may feel pressured to take short cuts, such as “cutting and pasting” parts of earlier notes into the daily record, thereby increasing the risk of errors. EMRs also structure information in a manner that disrupts the traditional narrative flow across time and among providers. These features, which may be frustrating for some providers, must be weighed against the advantages of ready access to past medical history, imaging, laboratory data, and consultant notes. Furthermore, the effort, time, and attention needed to maintain and utilize the EMR have led to a growing sense of dissatisfaction among physicians, lessening professional and personal well-being as a result. Clearly, this is an area of daily practice that requires improvement both for the delivery of safe and optimal care and physician wellness. It is important to emphasize that information technology is merely a tool and can never replace the clinical decisions that are best made by the physician. Clinical knowledge and an understanding of a patient’s needs, supplemented by quantitative tools, still represent the best approach to decision-making in the practice of medicine. \n\n## THE PATIENT–PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP \n\n The significance of the intimate personal relationship between physician and patient cannot be too strongly emphasized, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both the diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it. One of the essential qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient. —Francis W. Peabody, October 21, 1925, Lecture at Harvard Medical School \n\nPhysicians must never forget that patients are individuals with problems that all too often transcend their physical complaints. They are not “cases” or “admissions” or “diseases.” Patients do not fail treatments; treatments fail to benefit patients. This point is particularly important in this era of high technology in clinical medicine. Most patients are anxious and fearful. Physicians should instill confidence and offer reassurance, but they must never come across as arrogant, patronizing, impatient, or hurried. A professional attitude, coupled with warmth and openness, can do much to alleviate anxiety and to encourage patients to share all aspects of their medical history. Empathy and compassion are the essential features of a caring physician. The physician needs to consider the setting in which an illness occurs—in terms not only of patients themselves but also of their familial, social, and cultural backgrounds. The ideal patient–physician relationship is based on thorough knowledge of the patient, mutual trust, and the ability to communicate. \n\n#### Informed Consent The fundamental principles of medical ethics \n\nrequire physicians to act in the patient’s best interest and to respect the patient’s autonomy. Both principles are reflected in the process of informed consent. Patients are required to sign consent forms for most diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Many patients possess limited medical knowledge and must rely on their physicians for advice. Communicating in a clear and understandable manner, physicians must fully discuss the alternatives for care and explain the risks, benefits, and likely consequences of each alternative. The physician is responsible for ensuring that the patient thoroughly understands these risks and benefits; encouraging questions is an important part of this process. It may be necessary to go over certain issues with the patient more than once. This is the very definition of informed consent. Complete, clear \n\n explanation and discussion of the proposed procedures and treatment can greatly mitigate the fear of the unknown that commonly accompanies hospitalization. Often the patient’s understanding is enhanced by repeatedly discussing the issues in an unthreatening and supportive way, answering new questions that occur to the patient as they arise. Continuing efforts to educate the patient are essential. Patients are frequently inhibited from understanding by the fear of an uncertain future and potential impact of the illness on themselves and their families. Clear communication can also help alleviate misunderstandings in situations where complications of intervention occur. Special care should also be taken to ensure that a physician seeking a patient’s informed consent has no real or apparent conflict of interest. \n\n#### Approach to Grave Prognoses and Death No circumstance is \n\n more distressing than the diagnosis of an incurable disease, particularly when premature death is inevitable. What should the patient and family be told? What measures should be taken to maintain life? What can be done to optimize quality of life? Transparency of information, delivered in an appropriate manner, is essential in the face of a terminal illness. Even patients who seem unaware of their medical circumstances, or whose family members have protected them from diagnoses or prognoses, often have keen insights into their condition. They may also have misunderstandings that can lead to additional anxiety. The patient must be given an opportunity to speak with the physician and ask questions. A wise and insightful physician uses such open communication as the basis for assessing what the patient wants to know and when he or she wants to know it. On the basis of the patient’s responses, the physician can assess the most appropriate time and pace for sharing information. Ultimately, the patient must understand the expected course of the disease so that appropriate plans and preparations can be made. The patient should participate in decision-making with an understanding of the goal of treatment (palliation) and its likely effects. The patient’s religious beliefs should be taken into consideration. Some patients may find it easier to share their feelings about death with their physician, nurses, or members of the clergy than with family members or friends. The physician should provide or arrange for emotional, physical, and spiritual support, and must be compassionate, unhurried, and open. In many instances, there is much to be gained by the laying on of hands. Pain should be controlled adequately, human dignity maintained, and isolation from family and close friends avoided. These aspects of care tend to be overlooked in hospitals, where the intrusion of life-sustaining equipment can detract from attention to the individual person and encourage concentration instead on the life-threatening disease, against which the battle ultimately will be lost in any case. In the face of terminal illness, the goal of medicine must shift from cure to care in the broadest sense of the term. Primum succurrere, first to help, is a guiding principle. In offering care to a dying patient, a physician should be prepared to provide information to family members and deal with their grief and sometimes their feelings of guilt or even anger. It is important for the physician to assure the family that everything reasonable is being done. A substantial challenge in these discussions is that the physician often does not know exactly how to gauge the prognosis. In addition, various members of the health care team may offer different opinions. Good communication among providers is essential so that consistent information is provided to patients. This is especially important when the best path forward is uncertain. Advice from experts in palliative and terminal care should be sought whenever appropriate to ensure that clinicians are not providing patients with unrealistic expectations. For a more complete discussion of end-oflife care, see Chap. 12. \n\n#### Maintaining Humanism and Professionalism Many trends \n\n in the delivery of health care tend to make medical care impersonal. These trends, some of which have been mentioned already, include (1) vigorous efforts to reduce the escalating costs of health care; (2) the growing number of managed-care programs, which are intended to reduce costs but where the patient may have little choice in selecting a physician; (3) increasing reliance on technological advances and \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n computerization; and (4) the need for numerous physicians and other health professionals to be involved in the care of most patients who are seriously ill. In light of these changes in the medical care system, it is a major challenge for physicians to maintain the humane aspects of medical care. The American Board of Internal Medicine, working together with the American College of Physicians–American Society of Internal Medicine and the European Federation of Internal Medicine, has published a Charter on Medical Professionalism that underscores three main principles in physicians’ contract with society: (1) the primacy of patient welfare, (2) patient autonomy, and (3) social justice. While medical schools appropriately place substantial emphasis on professionalism, a physician’s personal attributes, including integrity, respect, and compassion, also are extremely important. In the United States, the Gold Humanism Society recognizes individuals who are exemplars of humanistic patient care and serve as role models for medical education and training. Availability to the patient, expression of sincere concern, willingness to take the time to explain all aspects of the illness, and a nonjudgmental attitude when dealing with patients whose cultures, lifestyles, attitudes, and values differ from those of the physician are just a few of the characteristics of a humane physician. Every physician will, at times, be challenged by patients who evoke strongly negative or positive emotional responses. Physicians should be alert to their own reactions to such situations and should consciously monitor and control their behavior so that the patient’s best interest remains the principal motivation for their actions at all times. Another important aspect of patient care involves an appreciation of the patient’s “quality of life,” a subjective assessment of what each patient values most. This assessment requires detailed, sometimes intimate knowledge of the patient, which usually can be obtained only through deliberate, unhurried, and often repeated conversations. Time pressures will always threaten these interactions, but they should not diminish the importance of understanding and seeking to fulfill the priorities of the patient. \n\n#### ■ EXPANDING FRONTIERS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE \n\n#### The Era of “Omics” In the spring of 2003, announcement of \n\n the complete sequencing of the human genome officially ushered in the genomic era. However, even before that landmark accomplishment, the practice of medicine had been evolving as a result of insights into both the human genome and the genomes of a wide variety of microbes. The clinical implications of these insights are illustrated by the complete genome sequencing of H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 and even faster sequencing of COVID-19 in early 2020, leading to the swift development and dissemination of effective vaccines. Today, gene expression profiles are being used to guide therapy and inform prognosis for a number of diseases, and genotyping is providing a new means to assess the risk of certain diseases as well as variations in response to a number of drugs. Despite these advances, the use of complex genomics in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease is still in its early stages. The task of physicians is complicated by the fact that phenotypes generally are determined not by genes alone but by the complex interactions among genes and gene products, and by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Rapid progress is also being made in other areas of molecular medicine. Epigenetics is the study of alterations in chromatin and histone proteins and methylation of DNA sequences that influence gene expression (Chap. 483). Every cell of the body has identical DNA sequences; the diverse phenotypes a person’s cells manifest are, in part, the result of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic alterations are associated with a number of cancers and other diseases. Proteomics, the study of the entire library of proteins made in a cell or organ and the complex relationship of these proteins to disease, is enhancing the repertoire of the 23,000 genes in the human genome through alternate splicing, posttranslational processing, and posttranslational modifications that often have unique functional consequences. The presence or absence of particular proteins in the circulation or in cells is being explored for many diagnostic and disease-screening \n\n applications. Microbiomics is the study of the resident microbes in humans and other mammals, which together compose the microbiome. The human haploid genome has ~23,000 genes, whereas the microbes residing on and in the human body encompass more than 3–4 million genes; these resident microbes are likely to be of great significance with regard to health status. Ongoing research is demonstrating that the microbes inhabiting human mucosal and skin surfaces play a critical role in maturation of the immune system, in metabolic balance, in brain function, and in disease susceptibility. A variety of environmental factors, including the use and overuse of antibiotics, have been tied experimentally to substantial increases in disorders such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and immune-mediated diseases in both adults and children. Metagenomics, of which microbiomics is a part, is the genomic study of environmental species that have the potential to influence human biology directly or indirectly. An example is the study of exposures to microorganisms in farm environments that may be responsible for the lower incidence of asthma among children raised on farms. Metabolomics is the study of the range of metabolites in cells or organs and the ways they are altered in disease states. The aging process itself may leave telltale metabolic footprints that allow the prediction (and possibly the prevention) of organ dysfunction and disease. It seems likely that disease-associated patterns will be found in lipids, carbohydrates, membranes, mitochondria and mitochondrial function, and other vital components of cells and tissues. Exposomics is the study of the exposome—i.e., the environmental exposures such as smoking, sunlight, diet, exercise, education, and violence that together have an enormous impact on health. All of this new information represents a challenge to the traditional reductionist approach to medical thinking. The variability of results in different patients, together with the large number of variables that can be assessed, creates challenges in identifying preclinical disease and defining disease states unequivocally. Accordingly, the tools of systems biology and network medicine are being applied to the enormous body of information (“big data”) now obtainable for every patient and may eventually provide new approaches to classifying disease. For a more complete discussion of a complex systems and network science approach to human disease, see Chap. 486. The rapidity of these advances may seem overwhelming to practicing physicians; however, physicians have an important role to play in ensuring that these powerful technologies and sources of new information are applied judiciously to patient care. Since omics are evolving so rapidly, physicians and other health care professionals must engage in continuous learning so that they can apply this new knowledge to the benefit of their patients’ health and well-being. Genetic testing requires wise counsel based on an understanding of the value and limitations of the tests as well as the implications of their results for specific individuals. For a more complete discussion of genetic testing, see Chap. 467. \n\n#### The Globalization of Medicine \nPhysicians should be cognizant  of diseases and health care services beyond local boundaries. Global travel has critical implications for disease spread, and it is not uncommon for diseases endemic to certain regions to be seen in other regions after a patient has traveled to and returned from those regions. The outbreak of Zika virus infections in the Americas is a cogent example of this phenomenon. In addition, factors such as wars, the migration of refugees, and increasing climate extremes are contributing to changing disease profiles worldwide. Patients have broader access to unique expertise or clinical trials at distant medical centers, even those in other countries, and the cost of travel may be offset by the quality of care at those distant locations. As much as any other factor influencing global aspects of medicine, the Internet has transformed the transfer of medical information throughout the world. This change has been accompanied by the transfer of technological skills through telemedicine and international consultation—for example, interpretation of radiologic images and pathologic specimens. For a complete discussion of global issues, see Chap. 472. \n\n#### Medicine on the Internet On the whole, \nthe Internet has had a  positive effect on the practice of medicine; through personal computers, a wide range of information is available to physicians and patients \n\n---\n\n#### The Practice of Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 1 \n\nalmost instantaneously at any time and from anywhere in the world. This medium holds enormous potential for the delivery of current information, practice guidelines, state-of-the-art conferences, journal content, textbooks (including this text), and direct communications with other physicians and specialists, expanding the depth and breadth of information available to the physician regarding the diagnosis and care of patients. Medical journals are now accessible online, providing rapid sources of new information. By bringing them into direct and timely contact with the latest developments in medical care, this medium also serves to lessen the information gap that has hampered physicians and health care providers in remote areas. Patients, too, are turning to the Internet in increasing numbers to acquire information about their illnesses and therapies and to join Internet-based support groups. Patients often arrive at a clinic visit with sophisticated information about their illnesses. In this regard, physicians are challenged in a positive way to keep abreast of the latest relevant information while serving as an “editor” as patients navigate this seemingly endless source of information, the accuracy and validity of which are not uniform. A critically important caveat is that virtually anything can be published on the Internet, with easy circumvention of the peer-review process that is an essential feature of academic publications. Both physicians and patients who search the Internet for medical information must be aware of this danger. Notwithstanding this limitation, appropriate use of the Internet is revolutionizing information access for physicians and patients, and in this regard represents a remarkable resource that was not available to practitioners a generation ago. \n\n#### Public Expectations and Accountability The general public’s \n\nlevel of knowledge and sophistication regarding health issues has grown rapidly over the past few decades. As a result, expectations of the health care system in general and of physicians in particular have risen. Physicians are expected to master rapidly advancing fields (the science of medicine) while considering their patients’ unique needs (the art of medicine). Thus, physicians are held accountable not only for the technical aspects of the care they provide but also for their patients’ satisfaction with the delivery and costs of care. In many parts of the world, physicians increasingly are expected to account for the way in which they practice medicine by meeting certain standards prescribed by federal and local governments. The hospitalization of patients whose health care costs are reimbursed by the government and other third parties is subjected to utilization review. Thus, a physician must defend the cause for and duration of a patient’s hospitalization if it falls outside certain “average” standards. Authorization for reimbursement increasingly is based on documentation of the nature and complexity of an illness, as reflected by recorded elements of the history and physical examination. A growing “payfor-performance” movement seeks to link reimbursement to quality of care. The goal of this movement is to improve standards of health care and contain spiraling health care costs. In many parts of the United States, managed (capitated) care contracts with insurers have replaced traditional fee-for-service care, placing the onus of managing the cost of all care directly on the providers and increasing the emphasis on preventive strategies. In addition, physicians are expected to give evidence of their current competence through mandatory continuing education, patient record audits, maintenance of certification, and relicensing. \n\n#### Medical Ethics and New Technologies The rapid pace of tech\n\nnological advances has profound implications for medical applications that go far beyond the traditional goals of disease prevention, treatment, and cure. Cloning, genetic engineering, gene therapy, human– computer interfaces, nanotechnology, and use of targeted therapies have the potential to modify inherited predispositions to disease, select desired characteristics in embryos, augment “normal” human performance, replace failing tissues, and substantially prolong life span. Given their unique training, physicians have a responsibility to help shape the debate on the appropriate uses of and limits placed on these new technologies and to consider carefully the ethical issues associated with the implementation of such interventions. As medicine becomes more complex, shared decision-making is increasingly important, not \n\n only in areas such as genetic counseling and end-of-life care, but also in diagnostic and treatment options. \n\n#### Learning Medicine More than a century has passed since the \n\n publication of the Flexner Report, a seminal study that transformed medical education and emphasized the scientific foundations of medicine as well as the acquisition of clinical skills. In an era of burgeoning information and access to medical simulation and informatics, many schools are implementing new curricula that emphasize lifelong learning and the acquisition of competencies in teamwork, communication skills, system-based practice, and professionalism. The tools of medicine also change continuously, necessitating formal training in the use of EMRs, large datasets, ultrasound, robotics, and new imaging techniques. These and other features of the medical school curriculum provide the foundation for many of the themes highlighted in this chapter and are expected to allow physicians to progress, with experience and learning over time, from competency to proficiency to mastery. At a time when the amount of information that must be mastered to practice medicine continues to expand, increasing pressures both within and outside of medicine have led to the implementation of restrictions on the amount of time a physician-in-training can spend in the hospital and in clinics. Because the benefits associated with continuity of medical care and observation of a patient’s progress over time were thought to be outstripped by the stresses imposed on trainees by long hours and by fatigue-related errors, strict limits were set on the number of patients that trainees could be responsible for at one time, the number of new patients they could evaluate in a day on call, and the number of hours they could spend in the hospital. In 1980, residents in medicine worked in the hospital more than 90 hours per week on average. In 1989, their hours were restricted to no more than 80 per week. Resident physicians’ hours further decreased by ~10% between 1996 and 2008, and in 2010, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education further restricted (i.e., to 16 hours per shift) consecutive in-hospital duty hours for first-year residents. The impact of these changes is still being assessed, but the evidence that medical errors have decreased as a consequence is sparse. An unavoidable by-product of fewer hours at the bedside is an increase in the number of “handoffs” of patient responsibility from one physician to another. These transfers often involve a transition from a physician who knows the patient well, having evaluated that individual on admission, to a physician who knows the patient less well. It is imperative that these transitions of responsibility be handled with care and thoroughness, with all relevant information exchanged and acknowledged. These issues highlight the challenge our profession has in establishing a reliable measure of physician effectiveness. \n\n#### The Physician as Perpetual Student From the time physi\n\n cians graduate from medical school, it becomes all too apparent that this milestone is symbolic and that they must embrace the role of a “perpetual student.” This realization is at the same time exhilarating and anxiety-provoking. It is exhilarating because physicians can apply constantly expanding knowledge to the treatment of their patients; it is anxiety-provoking because physicians realize that they will never know as much as they want or need to know. Ideally, physicians will translate the latter feeling into energy through which they can continue to improve and reach their potential. It is the physician’s responsibility to pursue new knowledge continually by reading, attending conferences and courses, and consulting colleagues and the Internet. This is often a difficult task for a busy practitioner; however, a commitment to continued learning is an integral part of being a physician and must be given the highest priority. \n\n#### The Physician as Citizen Being a physician is a privilege. The \n\n capacity to apply one’s skills for the benefit of fellow human beings is a noble calling. The physician–patient relationship is inherently unbalanced in the distribution of power. In light of their influence, physicians must always be aware of the potential impact of what they do and say, and must always strive to strip away individual biases and preferences to find what is best for their patients. To the extent possible, physicians should also act within their communities to promote health \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n and alleviate suffering. Meeting these goals begins by setting a healthy example and continues in taking action to deliver needed care even when personal financial compensation may not be available. \n\n#### Research, Teaching, and the Practice of Medicine The word \n\n doctor is derived from the Latin docere, “to teach.” As teachers, physicians should share information and medical knowledge with colleagues, students of medicine and related professions, and their patients. The practice of medicine is dependent on the sum total of medical knowledge, which in turn is based on an unending chain of scientific discovery, clinical observation, analysis, and interpretation. Advances in medicine depend on the acquisition of new information through research, and improved medical care requires the transmission of that information. As part of their broader societal responsibilities, physicians should encourage patients to participate in ethical and properly approved clinical investigations if these studies do not impose undue hazard, discomfort, or inconvenience. Physicians engaged in clinical research must be alert to potential conflicts of interest between their research goals and their obligations to individual patients. The best interests of the patient must always take priority. \n\n To wrest from nature the secrets which have perplexed philosophers in all ages, to track to their sources the causes of disease, to correlate the vast stores of knowledge, that they may be quickly available for the prevention and cure of disease—these are our ambitions. —William Osler, 1849–1919 \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Cheston CC et al: Social media use in medical education: A systematic review.

The ultimate goal of preventive strategies is to avoid premature death. However, as longevity has increased dramatically \n\n# 2 \n\n## Promoting Good Health \n\n Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, Kathleen M.

Representation of normative aging with loss of the full stock of health with which individuals are born (indicating gain of morbidity), contrasted with a squared curve with greater longevity and fuller stock of health (less morbidity) until shortly before death. The “squared curve” represents the likely ideal situation for most patients. \n\n worldwide over the last century (largely as a result of public health practices), increasing emphasis is placed on prevention for the purpose of preserving quality of life and extending the health span, not just the life span. Given that all patients will eventually die, the goal of prevention ultimately becomes compression of morbidity toward the end of the life span; that is, reduction of the amount of burden and time spent with disease prior to dying. As shown in Fig. 2-1 , normative aging tends to involve a steady decline in the stock of health, with accelerating decline over time. Successful prevention offers the opportunity both to extend life and to extend healthy life, thus “squaring the curve” of health loss during aging. Prevention strategies have been characterized as tertiary, secondary, primary, and primordial. Tertiary prevention requires rapid action to prevent imminent death in the setting of acute illness, such as through percutaneous coronary intervention in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Secondary prevention strategies focus on avoiding the recurrence of disease and death in an individual who is already affected. For example, tamoxifen is recommended for women with surgically treated early-stage, estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, because it reduces the risk of recurrent breast cancer (including in the contralateral breast) and death. Primary prevention attempts to reduce the risk of incident disease among individuals with one or more risk factors. Treatment of elevated blood pressure in individuals who have not yet experienced cardiovascular disease represents one example of primary prevention that has proven effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease. Primordial prevention is a more recent concept (first introduced in 1979) that focuses on prevention of the development of risk factors for disease, not just prevention of disease. Primordial prevention strategies emphasize upstream determinants of risk for chronic diseases, such as eating patterns, physical activity, and environmental and social determinants of health. It therefore encompasses medical treatment strategies for some individuals as well as a strong reliance on public health and social policy. It is increasingly clear that primordial prevention represents the ultimate means for reducing the burden of chronic diseases of aging. Once risk factors develop, it is difficult to restore risk to the low level of someone who never developed the risk factor. The time spent with adverse levels of the risk factor often causes irreversible damage that precludes complete restoration of low risk. For example, individuals with hypertension who are treated back to optimal levels (\u003c120/\u003c80 mmHg) do have a lower risk compared with untreated patients with hypertension, but they still have twice the risk of cardiovascular events as those who maintained optimal blood pressure without medications. Patients with elevated blood pressure that is subsequently treated have greater left ventricular mass index, worse renal function, and more evidence of atherosclerosis and other target organ damage as a result of the time spent with elevated blood pressure; such damage cannot be fully reversed despite efficacious therapy with antihypertensive medications. Conversely, as described below in greater detail, individuals who maintain optimal levels of all major \n\n---\n\n#### Promoting Good Health \n\n#### CHAPTER 2 \n\n may improve adherence; ignoring them will likely lead to therapeutic failure. Numerous studies demonstrate that, even in high-functioning health systems, only ~50% of patients are taking recommended, evidence-based secondary prevention medications, such as statins, by 1 year after a myocardial infarction. In patients who are eligible for primary prevention strategies, it is important to frame the discussion around the overall evidence base as well as an individual patient’s likelihood of benefit from a given preventive intervention. A first step is to understand the patient’s estimated absolute risk for disease in the foreseeable future or during their remaining life span. However, absolute risk estimation and presentation of those risks are generally insufficient to motivate behavior change. It is critical to assess the patient’s understanding and tolerance of the risk, their readiness to implement lifestyle changes or adhere to drug therapy, and their overall preferences regarding use of drug therapy to prevent an event (e.g., cancer, myocardial infarction, stroke). The clinician can help the patient by informing them of the risks for disease and potential for absolute benefits (and harms) from the available evidence-based choices. This may take more than one conversation, but given that diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, are the leading causes of premature death and disability, the time is well spent. Partnering with the patient through motivational interviewing may assist in the process of selecting initial approaches to prevention. Selecting an area that the patient feels they are ready to change can lead to better adherence and greater achievement of success in the short and longer term. If the patient is uncertain what course to choose, prudence would dictate focusing on control of risk factors that may lead to the most rapid reduction in risk for acute events. For example, blood pressure is both a chronic risk factor and an acute trigger for cardiovascular events. Thus, if a patient has both significant elevations in blood pressure and dyslipidemia, it would be appropriate to focus initial efforts on blood pressure control. Likewise, a focus on smoking cessation can lead to more rapid reductions in risk for acute events than some other lifestyle interventions. \n\n#### ■ PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION ACROSS \n\n#### THE LIFE COURSE \n\n#### Periodic Health Evaluations The “routine annual physical” has \n\n in many ways become an expected part of the patient-physician relationship in primary care practice. However, evidence for the efficacy of the periodic health evaluation in asymptomatic adults unselected for risk factors or disease is mixed and depends on the outcome. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of published trials have consistently observed lack of benefit (and also lack of harm) in terms of total mortality in association with periodic health evaluations. Data are more heterogeneous but overall suggest no benefit for canceror cardiovascular-specific mortality, with the potential for either benefit or harm depending on number of evaluations and patient-level factors. Well-designed studies on nonfatal clinical events and morbidity have been sparsely reported, but there appear to be no large effects. Periodic health evaluations do appear to lead to greater diagnosis of certain conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, as expected. Likewise, periodic health examinations also improve the delivery of recommended preventive services, such as gynecologic examinations and Papanicolaou smears, fecal occult blood testing, and cholesterol screening. The benefits and risks associated with screening tests are discussed in detail in Chap. 6. Risks of routine evaluations include inappropriate testing or overtesting or false-positive findings that require follow-up and induce patients to worry. Periodic health examinations appear to be associated with less patient worry. On balance, given the lack of convincing evidence of harm and the potential for better delivery of appropriate screening, counseling, and preventive services, periodic health evaluations appear reasonable for general populations at average risk for chronic conditions. It is important to note that routine annual comprehensive physical examinations of asymptomatic adult patients have very low yield and may take an inordinate amount of time in a wellness visit. Such time \n\ncardiovascular risk factors into middle age through primordial prevention essentially abolish their lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease while also living substantially longer and having a lower burden and later onset of other comorbid illnesses (compression of morbidity). Prevention strategies should be distinguished from disease screening strategies. Screening attempts to detect evidence of disease at its earliest stages, when treatment is likely to be more efficacious than for advanced disease **(Chap. 6)**. Screening can be performed in service of prevention, especially if it aids in identifying preclinical markers, such as dyslipidemia or hyperglycemia, associated with elevated disease risk. \n\n#### ■ HEALTH PROMOTION \n\nIn recent decades, medical practice has increasingly focused on clinical and public health approaches to promote health, and not just prevent disease. Prevention of disease is a worthy individual and societal goal in and of itself, but it does not necessarily guarantee health. Health is a broader construct encompassing more than just absence of disease. It includes biologic, physiologic, and psychological domains (among others) in a continuum, rather than occurring as a dichotomous trait. Health is therefore somewhat subjective, but attempts have been made to use more objective criteria to define health in order to raise awareness, prevent disease, and promote healthy longevity. For example, in 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) defined a new construct of “cardiovascular health” based on evidence of associations with longevity, disease avoidance, healthy longevity, and quality of life. The definition of cardiovascular health is based on seven health behaviors and health factors (eating pattern, physical activity, smoking status, body mass index [BMI], and levels of blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose) and includes a spectrum from poor to ideal. Individuals with optimal levels of all seven metrics simultaneously are considered to have ideal cardiovascular health. The state of cardiovascular health for an individual or a population can be assessed with simple scoring by counting the number of ideal metrics (out of seven) or applying 0 points for each poor metric, 1 point for each intermediate metric, and 2 points for each ideal metric, thus creating a composite cardiovascular health score ranging from 0 to 14 points. Higher cardiovascular health scores in younger and middle ages have been associated with greater longevity, lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, lower incidence of other chronic diseases of aging (including dementia, cancer, and more), compression of morbidity, greater quality of life, and lower health care costs, achieving both individual and societal goals for healthy aging and further establishing the critical importance of primordial prevention and cardiovascular health promotion. Focusing on health promotion, rather than just disease prevention, may also provide greater motivation for patients to pursue lifestyle changes or adhere to clinician recommendations. Extensive literature suggests that providing patients solely with information regarding disease risk, or risk reduction with treatment, is unlikely to motivate desired behavior change. Empowering patients with strategies to achieve positive health goals after discussing risks can provide more effective adherence and better long-term outcomes. In the case of smoking cessation, enumerating only the risks of smoking can lead to patient inertia and therapeutic nihilism and has proven to be an ineffective approach, whereas strategies that incorporate positive health messaging, support, and feedback, with appropriate use of evidence-based therapies, have proven far more effective. \n\n#### ■ PRIORITIZING PREVENTION STRATEGIES \n\nIn secondary prevention, the patient already has manifest clinical disease and is therefore at high risk for progression. The approach should be to work with the patient to implement all evidence-based strategies that will help to prevent recurrence or progression. This will typically include drug therapy as well as therapeutic lifestyle changes to control ongoing risk factors that may have caused disease in the first place. Juggling priorities can be difficult, and barriers to implementation are many, including costs, time, patient health literacy, and patient and caregiver capacity to organize the regimen. Addressing these potential barriers with the patient can help to forge a therapeutic bond and \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n TABLE 2-1 Guidelines and Key Recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , 2020–2025 GUIDELINES KEY RECOMMENDATIONS \n\n**1. Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life**     **stage.** For the first 6 months of life, infants should     exclusively be fed human milk, or iron-fortified     formula if human milk is unavailable. From 6 to     12 months, infants should be introduced to a     variety of complementary nutrient-dense foods.     From 12 months to older adulthood, the dietary     pattern should meet nutrient needs, help achieve     a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of     chronic disease. \n\n**2. Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and**     **beverage choices to reflect personal preferences,**     **cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.**     The Dietary Guidelines provide a framework of     several dietary patterns intended to be customized     to individual needs and preferences, as well as     the foodways of the diverse cultures in the United     States. \n\n**3. Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-**     **dense foods and beverages, and stay within**     **calorie limits.** Nutrient-dense foods provide     vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting     components and have no or little added sugars,     saturated fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary     pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of     foods and beverages across all food groups, in     recommended amounts, and within calorie limits. \n\n**4. Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars,**     **saturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic**     **beverages.** At every life stage, meeting food group     recommendations, even with nutrient-dense     choices, fulfills most of a person’s daily calorie     needs and sodium limits, with little room for extra     added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium, or for     alcoholic beverages. \n\n The Dietary Guidelines’ Key Recommendations for healthy eating patterns should be applied in their entirety, given the interconnected relationship that each dietary component can have with others. They are also intended as a framework to accommodate personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations. Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages, and stay within calorie limits to achieve a healthy weight and reduce the risk of chronic disease. The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include: *\tVegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and lentils; starchy; and other vegetables *\tFruits, especially whole fruit *\tGrains, at least half of which are whole grain *\tDairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or lactose-free versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as alternatives *\tProtein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products *\tOils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts A healthy eating pattern limits: *\tAdded sugars—Less than 10% of calories per day starting at age 2. Avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for those younger than age 2. *\tSaturated fat—Less than 10% of calories per day starting at age 2. *\tSodium—Less than 2300 mg per day—and even less for children younger than age 14. *\tAlcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who are pregnant. Meet the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans In tandem with the recommendations above, Americans of all ages—children, adolescents, adults, and older adults—should meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to help promote health and reduce the risk of chronic disease. Americans should aim to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. The relationship between diet and physical activity contributes to calorie balance and managing body weight. \n\n Source: Adapted from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; \n\n2020. Available at https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025.pdf. \n\n may be better spent on assessing and counseling the patient on other aspects of their health, as discussed below. Evidence-based components that should be included in periodic evaluations focused on health and prevention include a number of age-appropriate screening tests for chronic disease and risk factors, preventive interventions including immunizations and chemoprevention for at-risk individuals, and preventive counseling. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force publishes its Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, which contains evidence-based recommendations from the Task Force on preventive services for which there is a high degree of certainty that the service provides at least moderate net clinical benefit (i.e., benefits outweigh harms significantly and to a reasonable magnitude). \n\n#### Healthy Behaviors and Lifestyles Owing to the paucity of \n\n evidence, the heterogeneity of study designs, and the diverse nature of interventions studied, many clinicians are uncertain as to how to deliver advice regarding healthy behaviors and lifestyles. Nevertheless, adverse behaviors and lifestyles contribute to \u003e75% of premature, preventable deaths and disability. Estimates from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that fewer than 1% of Americans achieve an optimal heart-healthy eating pattern. Thus, whereas there are many demands on time during a typical patientclinician encounter, few things may have more impact on longevity, health, and quality of life for asymptomatic patients than an efficient approach to assessing, documenting, and improving patients’ health behaviors. Indeed, the mere act of assessing health behaviors has been shown to affect patients’ health behaviors. Facility with tools for assessment of lifestyle and with strategies for counseling are therefore of paramount importance. \n\n#### Healthy Eating Patterns (see Chap. 332) Despite the existence \n\n of numerous “fad” diets and seemingly inconsistent recommendations \n\n on dietary composition, there is remarkable agreement about what should constitute a healthy eating pattern for the broad population to avoid nutritional deficits (i.e., vitamin deficiency) and excesses (i.e., excessive caloric intake) and to maximize potential health (Table 2-1). Optimal eating patterns consist of whole fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy oils, and allow for nonfat or low-fat dairy intake. They tend to exclude frequent ingestion of foods high in refined sugars and starches, saturated fat, and sodium. Since sodium and refined sugars and starches are the hallmark of much of the processed/packaged food supply, a simple rule of thumb is to provide or cook the majority of one’s own meals starting from whole foods and emphasizing fruits and vegetables. Likewise, foods prepared outside of the home tend to have higher fat and sodium content, so special attention to menu choices focused on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, while minimizing sauces and dressings, can help most individuals follow healthier eating patterns when eating food prepared outside the home. In all cases, sugar-sweetened beverages and nonnutritious snack foods should be minimized. If snacks are included, small amounts of healthy nuts and seeds or more fruits and vegetables should be encouraged. Specific conditions and diseases, such as diabetes, other metabolic disorders, allergies, and gastrointestinal disorders, may require tailored approaches to diet. In counseling most patients, the general approach should focus on whole foods, eating patterns, and appropriate calorie balance, rather than on specific micronutrients such as electrolytes or selected vitamins. It should be remembered that most patients have difficulty understanding nutritional labels on packaged foods, with the attendant demands on numeracy and health literacy. Dietary guidelines are published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services every 5 years, and these guidelines have undergone substantial \n\n---\n\n#### Promoting Good Health \n\n#### CHAPTER 2 \n\nevolution over time. The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines and Key Recommendations for 2020–2025 are summarized in Table 2-1 and emphasize the importance of healthy eating patterns for every stage of life, to avoid chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The core elements include eating patterns with nutrient-dense (rather than calorie-dense) whole foods and appropriate caloric intake to achieve and maintain healthy weight. The USDA guidelines focus on the concept of a healthy plate (rather than the prior food pyramid) for ease of counseling and adoption. Fifty percent of the plate should consist of vegetables and whole fruits, with remaining portions for whole grains and lean protein foods. When using fat for cooking, it should be done by sauteing in healthier oils (e.g., canola oil), and addition of judicious amounts of healthy raw oils (e.g., olive oil, nuts) to dishes is appropriate. Recommendations also focus on limitation of foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and moderation or avoidance of alcohol intake. The USDA guidelines focus on specific healthy eating patterns that adhere to these broad recommendations and are appropriate for ~97% of the general population. They identify a “Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern” that adheres closely to the evidence-based Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern but is customizable for different cultural or personal preferences. Alternative patterns, which vary more in emphasis than in content, include a “Healthy MediterraneanStyle Dietary Pattern” and a “Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern.” \n\n**AGEAND SEX-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS** Current dietary framework recommendations are generally similar for all life stages from ages ≥12 months, but recommended levels of caloric intake (and hence amounts of foods) differ by age, sex, and physical activity level. For example, recommended caloric intake ranges from 1000 calories/d for sedentary 2-year-old children to as high as 3200 calories/d for active 16to 18-year-old young men. Recommended caloric intakes peak in late adolescence or early adulthood for men and women and gradually decrease over ensuing decades. As with all lifestyle counseling aimed at behavior change, dietary approaches that partner with the patient and utilize motivational interviewing strategies and shared goals and commitments tend to work best, as described below (see “Approach to the Patient”). \n\n#### Physical Activity Similar to the approach to counseling regarding \n\nhealthy eating patterns, recommendations on participation in physical activity emphasize the point that any physical activity is better than none. A simple rule of thumb for patients is: “If you are doing nothing, do something; and if you are doing something, do more, every day.” The evidence base for physical activity indicates that the marginal benefits from physical activity are greatest in advancing from no activity to low levels of moderate activity. With increasing duration and intensity of activity, there is a continued curvilinear increase in health benefits, but the marginal gains for each additional minute of moderate-tovigorous activity slowly diminish. Thus, for adults, the recommended amount of physical activity is 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, performed in episodes of at least 5 min, and preferably spread throughout the week, plus participation in muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week. Additional health benefits can be realized by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. In counseling patients regarding physical activity, it is important to note that sedentary time (e.g., seated at work or at home in front of electronic screens) has adverse health consequences independent of the lack of physical activity during these episodes. Therefore, even modest efforts like standing at the desk and doing gentle stretching for periods during the day may be beneficial. It is also important to emphasize that participating in a variety of aerobic activities (biking, swimming, walking, jogging, rowing, elliptical training, stair-climbing, etc.) can be beneficial and may help to avoid overuse injuries and boredom with the exercise regimen. If patients choose to participate in muscle-strengthening activities for health improvement, emphasis should be placed on weights that allow more repetitions (e.g., 3 sets of 15–20 repetitions that can be performed comfortably, with a rest period in between) and on avoiding breath-holding and straining against a closed glottis. \n\n SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH RISK Patients may express concerns regarding the risk of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Whereas the risk of sudden death during exercise does increase directly with the amount of time spent exercising, this association is substantially mitigated by training effects. Thus, patients embarking on an exercise program should be encouraged to increase the duration of aerobic exercise gradually as tolerated, aiming for episodes of at least 30 min 5 times a week as an ideal. Once a comfortable duration is reached, incorporating interval training periods of more intensive activity interspersed during the exercise can provide greater fitness gains. EXTREME ENDURANCE ACTIVITIES As with other forms of exercise, extreme endurance activities such as triathlons and marathons should be undertaken only with appropriate and graded training. Such activities tend to take a greater toll on the musculoskeletal system over time than less extreme activities, and they are also associated with measurable damage to the myocardium and greater risks for other organ damage. Athletes participating in endurance activities routinely have elevations in cardiac troponin (a specific circulating marker of myocardial cell damage and death) at the end of the race, although elevations are lower in those who are well trained. Patients and clinicians should consider the patient’s overall health, specific limitations, potential for injury, and ability to train in decision-making regarding participation in endurance events. AGE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, second edition (2018) (Table 2-2) , recommend that preschool-aged children (aged 3–5 years) should be physically active throughout the day in a variety of activity types to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6–17 years should participate in ≥60 min of physical activity daily, most of which should be moderateor vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, including vigorous, muscle-strengthening, and bonestrengthening activities at least 3 days a week each. As noted above, adults aged 18–64 years are recommended to pursue at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week (or equivalent combinations), with at least 2 days of musclestrengthening activities. Adults aged ≥65 years should follow the adult guidelines or be as active as possible as abilities and conditions allow. For older adults, special emphasis is also placed on multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. \n\n#### Sleep Hygiene Sleeping between 7 and 9 h per night appears to be \n\n optimal for health in adults aged ≥18 years. Sleeping \u003c7 h is associated with adverse outcomes, including obesity, diabetes, elevated blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, depression, and all-cause mortality, as well as physiologic disturbances such as impaired immune function, increased pain sensitivity, and impaired cognitive performance. Conversely, achieving appropriate levels of sleep is associated with more success in weight loss, better blood pressure control among patients with hypertension, and improved mental health and performance. Regular sleep more than 9 h per night is appropriate for children and adolescents or individuals recovering from sleep deprivation or illness, but for most individuals, the effects on health are uncertain. Patients often express concerns about the quantity and quality of their sleep. With aging, both aspects of sleep tend to decline, even without overt sleep disorders. Documentation of sleep using a sleep log may assist in understanding different types of insomnia and sleep disorders. Encouraging daily activity to promote fatigue, avoidance of eating and drinking alcohol too close to bedtime, and regular daily sleep habits may help patients achieve better sleep. Regular use of sedative medications should generally be discouraged given the high potential for dependence, addiction, and altered sleep quality. DISORDERS OF SLEEP The prevalence of sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is poorly documented. A recent systematic review suggested that that the prevalence of clinically important OSA in the general adult population may be between 9% and 38%, with higher rates in men versus women, older versus younger adults, and those with higher versus lower BMI. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n TABLE 2-2 Recommendations from Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans AGE RECOMMENDATIONS 3–5 years *\tPreschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. *\tAdult caregivers of preschool-aged children should encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types. 6–17 years *\tIt is important to provide young people opportunities and encouragement to participate in physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that offer variety. *\tChildren and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years should do 60 min (1 h) or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily: *\tAerobic: Most of the 60 min or more per day should be either moderateor vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and should include vigorous-intensity physical activity on at least 3 days a week. *\tMuscle-strengthening: As part of their 60 min or more of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include musclestrengthening physical activity on at least 3 days a week. *\tBone-strengthening: As part of their 60 min or more of daily physical activity, children and adolescents should include bone-strengthening physical activity on at least 3 days a week. 18–64 years *\tAdults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better than none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. *\tFor substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 min (2 h and 30 min) to 300 min (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity or 75 min (1 h and 15 min) to 150 min (2 h and 30 min) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderateand vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. *\tAdditional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 min (5 h) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. *\tAdults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits. ≥65 years *\tThe key guidelines for adults also apply to older adults. In addition, the following key guidelines are just for older adults: *\tAs part of their weekly physical activity, older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. *\tOlder adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness. *\tOlder adults with chronic conditions should understand whether and how their conditions affect their ability to do regular physical activity safely. *\tWhen older adults cannot do 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow. Moderate-intensity physical activity: Aerobic activity that increases a person’s heart rate and breathing to some extent. On a scale relative to a person’s capacity, moderate-intensity activity is usually a 5 or 6 on a 0 to 10 scale. Brisk walking, dancing, swimming, or bicycling on a level terrain are examples. Vigorous-intensity physical activity: Aerobic activity that greatly increases a person’s heart rate and breathing. On a scale relative to a person’s capacity, vigorous-intensity activity is usually a 7 or 8 on a 0 to 10 scale. Jogging, singles tennis, swimming continuous laps, or bicycling uphill are examples. Muscle-strengthening activity: Physical activity, including exercise that increases skeletal muscle strength, power, endurance, and mass. It includes strength training, resistance training, and muscular strength and endurance exercises. Bone-strengthening activity: Physical activity that produces an impact or tension force on bones, which promotes bone growth and strength. Running, jumping rope, and lifting weights are examples.

A number of clinical tools have been developed to screen for sleep apnea, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the STOP (snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, high blood pressure) Questionnaire, and the STOP-Bang Questionnaire (STOP plus assessment of BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender), among others. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults owing to a lack of validation data in primary care settings. Nonetheless, the high prevalence and significant health consequences of sleep apnea suggest that clinicians should be alert for its potential presence, particularly in patients who are obese with symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence or witnessed apnea episodes. Other sleep disorders, such as restless leg syndrome, may be identified with simple history. \n\n#### Weight Management Overweight and obesity are prevalent in \n\n epidemic proportions in the United States and other industrialized nations (Chaps. 401 and 402). Since 1985, the prevalence of obesity in the United States has increased from ~10 to ~35%, and the prevalence of overweight is now ~40%. Overweight and obesity disproportionately affect individuals in lower socioeconomic strata and in many underserved minority populations, including black Americans, Latino Americans, and American Indians. In all race/ethnic groups, both overweight and obesity are associated with adverse health consequences, including diabetes, certain cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and degenerative joint disease. Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are much less common but pose major health consequences \n\n for affected patients and should be suspected particularly in younger women with history of rapid weight shifts or underweight status. Weight loss is one of the most difficult preventive interventions to achieve and sustain over time. However, several key factors can assist the patient and clinician, and early referral to a dietician can be very helpful. The first therapeutic goal is to aim for weight stabilization. Many of the risks of overweight and obesity are driven more strongly by continued weight gain, rather than overweight/obese status per se. Working with the patient to find initial strategies for weight maintenance can be a successful initial step with success for many patients. For those who can progress to considering weight loss, it is critical to help the patient understand that there is no standard solution. Experimentation and documentation are key. Tools to assist patients can include food and weight logs, activity logs, and smart phone apps. Some patients respond best to structured approaches such as intermittent fasting regimens or commercial dietary programs where meals are provided. Any of these approaches can be tried with or without social group supports. The key construct for weight loss is, of course, negative calorie balance. This is achieved through a combination of reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity. Patients may already understand, from prior weight loss attempts, what combination works best for them to achieve this. Some patients find that they cannot lose weight without increasing their exercise. For many, reduction of caloric intake is most efficient. Encouraging the patient to find what works for them is most important. The same principle holds for dietary content. Well-done feeding studies indicate that weight loss is dependent far more on the reduction of caloric intake than on the relative composition of fat, protein, and carbohydrate in the diet. There may be other medical reasons \n\n---\n\n#### Vaccine Opposition and Hesitancy \n\n#### CHAPTER 3 \n\nto choose one approach over another, but if not, encouraging the patient to pick one approach and document the results is an important start. Once weight loss is achieved, increase in activity is often required for its successful maintenance. \n\n#### Tobacco Cessation (see Chap. 454) Escaping nicotine depen\n\ndence is another major, but critical, challenge to prevention and wellness efforts. The addictive effects of nicotine have been well documented, with effects that can last for years after successful cessation. Assessing a patient’s past history of cessation attempts and current readiness for change are key first steps in forging a successful approach. Frequent follow-up and reinforcement, as well as use of nicotine replacement therapy and other cessation-promoting medications, are additional critical elements. Recidivism is the rule, and patients should expect to resume smoking and attempt again as they journey to tobacco cessation. Electronic cigarettes have some evidence for benefit in adult smoking cessation, but their potential for use by adolescents and young adults who are not smokers represents a major public health threat for a new generation of nicotine addiction, with unknown health consequences as a result of the high doses of nicotine delivered to developing organs, including the brain. Vaping of other substances, often in association with flavoring compounds, has also been associated with pulmonary and cardiovascular damage and should be actively discouraged. \n\n#### ■ VACCINATION (CHAP. 123) \n\nOne of the major advances in public health that has contributed to increases in health and longevity worldwide is the development of safe and effective vaccinations against endemic and epidemic infectious diseases. Patients should be counseled regarding age-appropriate vaccinations for their children and for themselves. Some individuals may be reluctant to receive a vaccination; in these cases, listening to the patient’s concerns is important, followed by explanation of the benefits to the individual, their family, and their community and review of the low risk for potential harms. It is true to say that no current vaccines are ever worse than the disease they prevent, although side effects may occur rarely. Thorough knowledge of the data on side effect rates and of efficacy will aid the clinician in helping the patient make a fully informed decision. \n\n#### ■ MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION \n\nAssessment for depression and cognitive impairment is important to address when patients exhibit symptoms or they or their family members express concerns. Both of these common conditions play a major role in reducing quality of life and are high on patients’ lists of concerns, even if not clearly expressed. Screening tools for depression are reviewed in **Chap. 452**. Cognitive function decline with aging or comorbid illness, including depression, should be anticipated. Assessment tools such as the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Mini-CogTM test are widely available and effective rapid assessment tools. \n\n#### Alcohol and Opioids (see Chaps. 453 and 456) Alcohol \n\ndependence and abuse are common and underdiagnosed. Rapid screening tools have proven efficacy for identifying patients with alcohol problems. In a systematic review, the CAGE (cut down, annoyed, guilty, eye opener) questionnaire was most effective at identifying alcohol abuse and dependence, with reasonable sensitivity and high specificity. The present opioid epidemic in the United States presents a new and substantial public health challenge given the high potential for dependency and abuse of these drugs. Rapid screening tools are available to assist clinicians in screening for opioid dependence. \n\n#### ■ ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDE \n\nRegular assessment of patient safety through simple questions about seat belt use, domestic violence, and gun safety in the home continues to be an important part of health promotion and wellness. Longstanding recommendations for assessment of suicidal ideation among patients with depression or a history of suicide attempts also continue to be relevant. \n\n### APPROACH TO THE PATIENT \n\n In the context of a clinical visit focused on health assessment, health promotion, and prevention, the basic skills of history-taking are of paramount importance. Much of the evaluation, counseling, and management that focus on health promotion and prevention also require engagement and buy-in from the patient in order to assist with recognition of contributing behaviors and to promote adherence to therapeutic plans. Therefore, in addition to standard history-taking, additional skills such as motivational interviewing and eliciting patient commitments and contracting may prove of significant value. The availability of additional tools to assist with screening, monitoring, and chronic management, both online and through wearable devices and mobile health technologies, is rapidly expanding, with uncertain implications for the future. Major research gaps exist in our understanding of how best to employ these newer technologies to improve health outcomes. Concepts of behavioral economics are being explored to better understand the psychology of decision-making and incentives as a means to improve lifestyle choices and adherence to treatment plans (Chap. 481). The limited time available to clinicians and patients during a wellness visit or periodic health examination (not driven by specific patient issues) makes it important to prioritize assessment and counseling for factors that affect longevity, health span, and quality of life over approaches that may have low yield, such as the annual comprehensive physical examination in an asymptomatic patient. Setting clear expectations for the content of a wellness visit may be a first step, and scheduling follow-up visits for findings or to continue indicated counseling are important steps to achieving better health outcomes. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Boulware LE et al: Systematic review: The value of the periodic health evaluation.

Dramatic declines in the morbidity and mortality of vaccine-preventable diseases have been observed, and the contribution of vaccines to the elimination, control, and prevention of infectious disease cannot be overstated. However, opposition and hesitancy to vaccines exist and are not new. Vaccine hesitancy has existed \n\n# 3 \n\n## Vaccine Opposition and \n\n## Hesitancy \n\n Julie A. Bettinger, Hana Mitchell \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n crisis of confidence many patients feel toward HCPs and the health care system. Studies demonstrate that an unambiguous, strong recommendation by trusted HCPs is most often the reason that patients, including those who are vaccine hesitant, choose to vaccinate. Strategies for counseling vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-resistant patients will be presented and examples of strong vaccine recommendations provided. Presenting strategies to increase vaccine demand at a system and policy level is beyond the scope of this chapter. While some physicians may have roles that allow them to act at this level, all physicians can act and influence their individual patients. Strategies to create active vaccine demand at the individual level alone will not solve vaccine hesitancy, but vaccine hesitancy cannot be addressed without these efforts. For further discussion of immunization principles and vaccine use, see Chap. 123. \n\n#### ■ VACCINE COVERAGE AND OUTBREAKS \n\n The epidemiologic data from measles outbreaks over the past 10 years provide an interesting illustration of the effects of vaccine opposition and hesitancy. For further discussion of measles, see Chap. 205. \n\n#### North America Herd immunity occurs when enough individuals \n\n in a population become immune to an infectious disease, usually through vaccination, that transmission of the infection stops. The level of immunity (or level of vaccine coverage) required to confer herd immunity varies with the specific infectious disease. Because measles is a highly contagious virus, a coverage rate of 93–95% must be achieved for vaccination to confer herd immunity and interrupt measles transmission. National coverage estimates place one-dose measles vaccine coverage rates in 2-year-old children at 92% in the United States and 88% in Canada. In spite of these relatively high levels of coverage in young children, numerous measles outbreaks have occurred in both countries since 2010 (Table 3-1). The vast majority (\u003e80%) of measles cases described in Table 3-1 occurred in underor completely unvaccinated individuals. Of note, many of these outbreaks highlight pockets of significantly underor unvaccinated individuals that are not apparent in national vaccine coverage statistics. Moreover, many of the outbreaks listed in Table 3-1 were ignited by unvaccinated returned travelers from areas with existing \n\n TABLE 3-1 Measles Outbreaks in North America YEAR/PLACE NO. OF CASES REASON 2010/Canada 70 An infected traveler to the 2010 Winter Olympics transmitted infection to an underand unvaccinated local population in British Columbia. 2011/Canada 776 Disease was imported from France by an unvaccinated returned traveler to Quebec.

A majority of cases occurred in underand unvaccinated persons. 2011/United States 118 Of 118 cases, 46 were in returned travelers from Europe and Asia/Pacific regions; 105 cases (89%) occurred in unvaccinated persons. 2013/United States 58 Disease was imported by a returned unvaccinated traveler from Europe.

So why did the World Health Organization rank these attitudes as one of the ten greatest threats to public health in 2019? Are current opposition and hesitancy any different from what has been seen before? Many sociologists, public health experts, and health care providers (HCPs) argue yes. Recent social and cultural trends, combined with new communication formats, have converged to create a particularly potent form of hesitancy and what some have labeled a crisis of confidence. This crisis manifests as a lack of trust in specific vaccines, vaccine programs, researchers, HCPs, the health care system, pharmaceutical companies, academics, policymakers, governments, and authority in general. (See “Focus: COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,” below.) The roots of modern vaccine hesitancy and opposition—defined as delay or rejection of vaccines in spite of availability—vary depending on the place and the population. For some individuals and communities, pseudoscience and false claims about the safety of existing vaccines (e.g., an unsupported link between measles vaccine and autism) have driven fears, increased hesitancy, and decreased acceptance. For others, real safety events, such as the association of narcolepsy with a specific pandemic influenza vaccine (Pandemrix), have justified concerns. In a few locations (e.g., Ukraine, Pakistan), vaccine hesitancy is the result of failed health systems or even state failures. Finally, for some groups, including some fundamentalist religious groups and alternativeculture communities, vaccine hesitancy and opposition reflect exclusion from and rejection of mainstream society and allopathic health care and manifest as a deep distrust of these institutions and their HCPs. Although the genesis of modern vaccine hesitancy is multifactorial, its outcomes are uniform: a decrease in vaccine demand and uptake, a decrease in coverage by childhood and adult vaccines, and an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases, outbreaks, and epidemics of disease. Addressing this crisis and moving people from vaccine hesitancy and refusal to acceptance and active demand require intervention at multiple levels: the individual, the health system (including public health), and the state. This chapter will define vaccine hesitancy and briefly describe its determinants and effects in North America (the United States and Canada). Physicians and other HCPs are well positioned to address the \n\n---\n\n#### Vaccine Opposition and Hesitancy \n\n#### CHAPTER 3 \n\noutbreaks or epidemics, who spread disease into an unvaccinated or under-vaccinated community. Many of the outbreaks were contained within the nonvaccinating community, but several spread to other under-vaccinated communities geographically contiguous with the outbreak community. More concerning still are the cases and outbreaks originating in communities that had not previously been identified as nonvaccinating. These cases likely highlight pockets of unvaccinated individuals who object for cultural rather than religious reasons. In the past, these nonvaccinating individuals did not exist in large enough clusters to sustain the spread of measles. Of further concern is the number of individuals included in outbreak statistics who have had one or sometimes even two doses of vaccine and who were thought to be protected but who still end up with the disease. The assumption is that one or two doses provide full disease immunity, but this is not always true. Often, individual level characteristics (age, immune compromise, etc.) affect the individual’s response to the vaccine and their level of protection. In other instances, vaccine protection can wane over time, thus leaving fully immunized individuals susceptible to infection. In fact, when herd immunity breaks (i.e., the level of immunity in a community becomes too low to prevent transmission of disease), the occurrence of cases even in fully immunized persons is seen, as reflected in outbreak statistics. As a result of decreased vaccination rates and the resulting disruption of herd immunity, these individuals may become more identifiable as non-immune. \n\n#### Outside North America Although overall coverage rates may still \n\nbe high in North America, they are lower in other parts of the world. In Samoa, for example, measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage before a recent outbreak was 31%; in the Philippines, it was 67%. Twenty years ago, vaccine coverage was sufficiently high in some parts of the world, including Europe, that an unvaccinated traveler from a nonvaccinating community to most regions would have been protected by herd immunity at their destinations. Today that is not the case: such travelers are likely to become infected in a country with active measles transmission and return home to spread the infection into their communities and possibly beyond. Thus active measles transmission, whether at home or abroad, places individuals who rely on herd immunity (e.g., immunocompromised persons and young infants) at increased risk. \n\n#### ■ FACTORS IN VACCINE HESITANCY \n\n Vaccination coverage rates provide an estimate of the proportion of children or adults in the population who have been vaccinated, but they do not indicate the proportion of individuals who are vaccine hesitant. An individual may be fully vaccinated but still be hesitant about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, or an individual may be unvaccinated as a result of access issues but may not be hesitant. Therefore, in attempts to understand a patient’s lack of vaccination, it is important to distinguish persons who are hesitant and refuse vaccines from those who need assistance to access the health care system and successfully complete vaccination. To this end, an understanding of vaccine hesitancy and its determinants is needed. Vaccine hesitancy and opposition are defined by the World Health Organization’s SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy as a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services.” The SAGE group describes vaccine hesitancy as “complex and context specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines.” It is useful to frame vaccine acceptance as a continuum pyramid, with active demand for all vaccines representing the largest group at the bottom of the pyramid and outright refusal of all vaccines depicted in the smallest group at the top. In the middle lies vaccine hesitancy, in which the degree of vaccine demand and acceptance varies. Fortunately, for disease control efforts, most individuals fall within the active-demand category or, if they are hesitant, still accept all vaccines. Hesitancy can be influenced by complacency, convenience, and confidence (Fig. 3-1). Complacency is self-satisfaction when accompanied by a lack of awareness for real dangers or deficiencies. Complacency exists in communities and individuals when the perceived risks of vaccinepreventable diseases are low and vaccination is not deemed a necessary preventive action. This attitude can apply to vaccination in general or to specific vaccines, such as influenza vaccines. Actual or perceived vaccine efficacy and effectiveness contribute to complacency. Patients who are complacent about vaccine-preventable diseases prioritize other lifestyle or health factors over vaccination. These individuals can be influenced toward vaccination by a strong recommendation from a trusted HCP or a local influenza outbreak. They can be influenced away from vaccination by a vaccine scare or misinformation on social \n\n- Strong distrust of health system/pharmaceutical industry/government \n\n- Strong-willed and committed against vaccines \n\n- Negative or traumatic experiences with HCPs and health system \n\n- May use natural approach to health/alternative HCPs \n\n- May have strong religious/moral considerations for refusal \n\n- May cluster in communities (geographic and online) \n\n- Vaccination is very unlikely; alternative strategies to protect individual and community must be discussed. \n\n Refuses \n\u003c!--ID: 1660788425405--\u003e\n\n- Questions safety and necessity of vaccines \n\n- Actively seeks information from many sources \n\n- Has conflicting feelings on whom to trust \n\n- Social norm is not vaccinating. \n\n- May have had negative or traumatic experience with health system \n\n- Vaccination may not occur; a strong trust relationship with HCP and many visits and conversations are required. \n\n Late and selective \n\u003c!--ID: 1660788425434--\u003e\n\n- Focused on vaccine risks \n\n- Conversation with trusted HCP strongly influential \n\n- Trusts HCPs \n\n- Actively seeking information and wants to verify it \n\n- Wants advice specific for their child \n\n- Confused by conflicting information \n\n- Social norm is vaccinating, but individual may feel conflicted by this norm. \n\n- Vaccination requires longer conversation and may require multiple visits. \n\n- Focused toward vaccine risk \n\n- Complacency: low perceived benefits of vaccination \n\n- Can move up or down continuum as a result of various influences (HCP recommendation, vaccine scare, outbreak) \n\n- Trusts HCPs and health system \n\n- Convenience: need few barriers to vaccination \n\n- Vaccination requires longer conversation but likely can be performed at same visit; potential exists to move to active demand. \n\n Hesitant – minor doubts and concerns \n\u003c!--ID: 1660788425441--\u003e\n\n- Confidence \n\n- Considers vaccines important \n\n- Considers vaccines safe \n\n- Trusts HCP/vaccines/health system \n\n- Social norm is vaccinating \n\n- Very short conversation with HCP about vaccination, in which HCP should address any questions to maintain active-demand status \n\n Active demand – no doubts or concerns \n\u003c!--ID: 1660788425448--\u003e\n\n Accepts vaccines \n\n Rejects vaccines \n\n Characteristics \n\n Presumptive Communication Approach \n\n Hesitant – many doubts and concerns \n\n Participatory Communication Approach \n\n**FIGURE 3-1 Vaccine acceptance continuum.** HCPs, health care providers.

Finally, the real or perceived ability of patients to take the action required for vaccination (i.e., self-efficacy) influences the role complacency plays in hesitancy and willingness to seek vaccination. Convenience is determined by the degree to which conversations about vaccination and other services can be provided in culturally safe contexts that are convenient and comfortable for the individual. Clearly, convenience varies by community, health clinic, and even patient. Persons who are criticized or scolded for not vaccinating themselves or their children may not feel comfortable or safe accessing health services. Factors such as affordability, geographic accessibility, language, and health literacy are important considerations when evaluating the convenience of existing clinical care. Any of these factors can affect vaccine acceptance and can push a patient who has some hesitancy toward vaccinating or not vaccinating. Confidence is based on trust in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, in the health care system that delivers vaccines (including HCPs), and in the policymakers or governments who decide which vaccines are needed and used. A continual erosion of confidence around vaccination, health systems, and governments drives today’s hesitancy and has been amplified by larger social and cultural trends in medicine, parenting, and information availability. \n\n#### ■ SOCIAL AND CULTURAL TRENDS \n\n#### Individualized Health Care Over the past 30 years, the focus of \n\n medicine and health care has shifted to patient-oriented, individualized care, with an increasing emphasis on treatment and prevention options tailored to the individual patient. In vaccination programs, this shift has manifested as requests for individualized vaccine recommendations and customized immunization schedules. The increasing personalization of medicine, while positive overall, has forced public health away from a focus on the community and its common good and has created tension between individual rights and community health. \n\n#### Parenting Trends The desire for an individualized approach to \n\n medicine and vaccination reflects broader cultural trends concerning individual risk management: accordingly, the individual is to blame for bad outcomes, and public institutions cannot be trusted to manage technological (i.e., vaccine-related) risks. This viewpoint is directly linked with cultural shifts in parenting and social norms defining what it means to be a “good parent.” The image of a good parent has been reframed to refer to someone whom several investigators have described as “a critical consumer of health services and products, accounting for their own individual situation as they see it with little regard for the implications of their decision on other children.” The archetypical good parent no longer unquestioningly trusts HCPs and other authorities and experts. According to this social norm, “good parents” should seek individual medical advice that is tailored for their child and specific to that child’s needs. While in essence not a bad thing, this norm can conflict directly with public health vaccine recommendations and schedules that are organized to maximize community health and to facilitate efficient provision of care at a community level. \n\n#### Traditional Media Newspapers, radio, and television have been \n\n criticized for their coverage of vaccines and in particular their coverage of the alleged link between MMR vaccine and autism. By offering equal coverage throughout the early to mid-2000s for both the scientific evidence and unproven claims of MMR vaccine harms, traditional media outlets provided a forum and a megaphone for the spread of pseudoscience. Equal coverage leads to false equivalencies. Celebrity advocates further amplified the message via this channel. The boost that traditional media provided to active vaccine resistance and, less directly, to vaccine hesitancy has not been adequately measured but must be considered in any discussion of vaccine hesitancy. After headlines about multiple outbreaks of measles and other vaccinepreventable diseases and continued direct criticism of the equalcoverage approach, some traditional media now reject and attempt to discredit pseudoscience. The effect this stance will have on increasing vaccine confidence is unknown. \n\n#### The Internet and Social Media Approximately 90% of Americans \n\n and 91% of Canadians use the Internet, and 80% of Americans and 60% of Canadians have a social network profile. Widespread access to social media can be empowering, but it is also problematic. The Internet and social media require users to select their information sources, creating an environment described as an “echo chamber” in which individuals choose information sources harboring beliefs or opinions similar to their own and thereby reinforcing their existing views. This situation has created a new platform for further spread of vaccine misinformation (inaccuracies due to error) and disinformation (deliberate lies) and has provided a forum for vaccine-resistant individuals, including celebrities, to organize and raise funds to support their efforts. The harmful effects of Internet and social media use on vaccine hesitancy have been well documented. Vaccine hesitancy increases for parents who seek their information from the Internet. Unfortunately, public health and health care institutions have been slow to adapt to this new communication medium and to recognize its influence and impact. In this medium, personal stories and anecdotes are now viewed as data and disproportionately influence vaccine decision-making, while traditional, more authoritative, fact-based information sources are deemphasized. Centralized monitoring by jurisdiction of vaccine misinformation and disinformation, with summaries of the relevant discourses and rebuttals provided to HCPs, has been proposed as a potential way to counter the influence of social media on vaccine hesitancy. While such strategies have been applied in single jurisdictions and appear to have had some success, their applicability to a broader context is unknown. Moreover, the resources for such a coordinated response have not been made available, and individual HCPs have been left to counter popular, shifting, viral communications on their own, patient by patient. As with traditional media, the social media landscape appears to be shifting. In 2019, the proliferation of anti-vaccination information combined with measles outbreaks in North America and increasing pressure from health leaders led large social media companies (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) to deemphasize anti-vaccination information by removing relevant advertisements and recommendations and decreasing their prominence in search results. While it is too soon to determine the effects of these measures, critics are skeptical that they will have the intended result of reducing vaccine misinformation and disinformation. Early evidence shows that misleading content is still widely available, with anti-vaccine advertisements now using the term “vaccine choice” to avoid censorship. More disturbingly, public health advertisements in support of vaccination have been included in social bans and removed from social media sites. In a more grassroots effort, providers and vaccine supporters have united on social media to provide online support and evidence-based facts to providers and others who support vaccines when they are attacked digitally by anti-vaccine supporters. For example, Shots Heard Round the World (www.shotsheard.com) is an effort led by two U.S. pediatricians to provide advice and support for HCPs who speak out about the importance of vaccines. Such efforts harness the power of social media in ways similar to those used by vaccine opponents and may prove successful in combating vaccine hesitancy. Given these social and cultural trends, no one should be surprised when individuals now question vaccination, express confusion about conflicting information and information sources, and feel unsure whom to trust. Their broader social context is telling them they should question everything and trust no one. This message is reinforced via misinformation and disinformation on social media. Recent vaccinepreventable disease outbreaks illustrate that effective engagement with individuals cannot be accomplished through one-way, top-down information provision (which still is often the de facto choice for health system communication), but rather requires a dialogue that takes into account the social processes surrounding individual vaccination decisions. It is at the interface between the individual and the health system in which conversations between HCPs and their patients can have the greatest impact. It is critical for all HCPs to discuss vaccines and provide strong vaccine recommendations—including HCPs who do not administer vaccines but who have established trust with their patients. \n\n---\n\n#### Vaccine Opposition and Hesitancy \n\n#### CHAPTER 3 \n\n### APPROACH TO THE PATIENT \n\nAn ideal vaccine-hesitancy intervention would result in full compliance with vaccination, the patient’s satisfaction with the health care encounter, and sustained trust in the HCP’s recommendations. On a programmatic level, vaccine-hesitancy interventions should be multicomponent, dialogue based, and tailored to specific under-vaccinated populations. Communicating with vaccine-hesitant individuals can be challenging and time-consuming. HCPs may feel that vaccine-hesitant patients cast doubt on their personal and professional integrity, their authority as medical experts, and their competence as communicators. Some HCPs may be reluctant to initiate conversations about vaccination because of concerns that discussing a sensitive topic may compromise their clinical rapport with their patients. Other HCPs may believe that they have not received sufficient training to confidently recommend vaccines and answer questions. Discussing vaccines with hesitant patients, while not always easy, provides an opportunity to honor the principles of patient-centered care by demonstrating an interest in patients’ opinions, engaging in dialogue, and ideally increasing patients’ confidence in vaccine recommendations. \n\nFACTORS IN EFFECTIVE VACCINE RECOMMENDATIONS \n\nVaccine recommendations ideally should be made within an established, trusting patient–provider relationship in which patients are comfortable asking questions and voicing concerns, even if their views on vaccines contradict the HCP’s recommendations. Recommending vaccines requires both provision of information and effective communication. There is no single “best practice” for how providers should approach recommending vaccines to vaccinehesitant individuals. In general, all vaccine recommendations should be (1) strong, making it clear that the provider supports and recommends vaccination; (2) tailored, acknowledging the vaccine attitudes and potential concerns of individual patients; (3) transparent and accurate, highlighting the benefits of vaccines while also communicating the risks; (4) supported by trustworthy information resources that patients can access and review after the clinical encounter; and (5) revisited, with repetition and reinforcement during follow-up health care encounters. \n\n**Strength of the Recommendation** HCPs should make it explicit (in the absence of medical contraindications) that vaccination based on the recommended schedule is the best option. While HCPs should take time to elicit patients’ questions and address concerns, the recommendation for vaccination should be made in clear and unambiguous terms. \n\n**Tailored Communication** Vaccine hesitancy occurs on a continuum (Fig. 3-1). Therefore, it is helpful for HCPs to have some understanding of their patients’ attitudes toward vaccination at the start of the health care appointment. Unfortunately, vaccine-hesitancy surveys for use as part of vaccine consultation visits have not been validated on a large scale. However, the following are some examples of questions that can be asked, depending on the setting. (1) Did you have a chance to review the vaccine leaflet we provided? Did you have any questions about it? (2) Have you ever been reluctant or hesitant about getting a vaccination for yourself or your child? If so, what were the reasons? (3) Are there other pressures in your life that prevent you from getting yourself or your child immunized on time? (4) Whom/what resources do you trust the most for information about vaccines? Whom/what resources do you trust the least? Communication style and content for patients in the activedemand category for vaccination will be different from those for individuals who are hesitant, late and selective, or strongly inclined to refuse vaccines. Two communication styles have been proposed for vaccine recommendations. Evidence shows that a presumptive/ directive approach (“Your child is due for MMR vaccination.”) results in higher rates of vaccine uptake than a participatory/guiding approach (“What are your thoughts about the MMR vaccine?”). \n\n However, adopting a strictly presumptive/directive approach may alienate some patients, especially those who are higher up on the hesitancy pyramid and who may feel that they are being pressured into vaccination before their concerns have been heard and addressed. Adopting a participatory/guiding approach and clarifying receptivity to vaccines may be more suitable for hesitant individuals with many doubts and concerns, persons with a late or selective attitude, and those who are strongly inclined to refuse vaccines. In addition, a participatory/guiding approach provides an opportunity for ongoing clinical rapport and dialogue between unvaccinated or under-vaccinated patients and their HCPs, even when it does not result in immediate vaccine uptake. Regardless of which approach is used, a strong vaccine recommendation should be made at each encounter. \n\n Transparency and Accuracy Vaccine recommendations should be transparent, should include accurate information about both the benefits and the risks of the vaccine, and should emphasize why the benefits outweigh the risks. For example, when evidence supports an association between a vaccine and an adverse event, the occurrence of the adverse event is often very rare and the event quickly resolves (Chap. 123). U.S. Federal law (under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) requires HCPs to provide a copy of the current Vaccine Information Statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which describes both benefits and risks of vaccines to an adult patient or to a child’s parent/ legal representative before vaccination. CDC Vaccine Information Statements should not replace a discussion with the HCP. Depending on the provider and the patient, a description of benefits and risks may include words and numbers, graphics, and personal anecdotes (e.g., why the provider vaccinates his or her own children). Personal anecdotes are powerful, and many hesitant patients seek and are influenced by them. A discussion of benefits and risks provides an opportunity to address specific misconceptions about a particular vaccine or about vaccines overall. For example, patients may be concerned about adverse events following vaccination that are not supported by evidence, such as autism following MMR vaccination or myocardial infarction following influenza vaccination in the elderly. Most adults—even those whose children are fully immunized— still have questions, misconceptions, or concerns about vaccines that should be addressed. A risk/benefit discussion allows HCPs to describe the vaccine safety monitoring systems in place. Providers should emphasize that vaccines are developed and approved through a highly regulated process that includes prelicensure clinical trials, review and approval by designated regulatory authorities (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada), strict manufacturing regulations, and ongoing postmarketing safety surveillance. \n\n Support from Accessible Information Sources All vaccine recommendations should be supported by additional information sources patients can assess after the health care encounter. HCPs play an important role as information intermediaries for their patients. They can navigate information (and misinformation) about vaccines and direct patients toward reliable, appropriate resources. HCPs should consider what resources will be suitable for a patient or patient population. Vaccine information resources are available in different media formats and use a combination of images and text to communicate the information to various audiences. See “Further Reading,” below, for suggestions or refer to resources provided by local health authorities. \n\n Revisiting and Reinforcement of Vaccine Recommendations All health care encounters offer an opportunity to revisit and reinforce vaccine recommendations. Vaccine-hesitant individuals who do not accept vaccines but are willing to review information should be offered a follow-up appointment to reinforce previously made recommendations and address further questions. Vaccine-hesitant \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n TABLE 3-2 Sample Vaccine Conversations STRONG VACCINE RECOMMENDATION “We are headed into the flu season. Getting flu vaccine not only protects you, but it helps protect other people around you who can get very sick from flu. I strongly recommend you get your flu shot. Do you know where to get it?” “You will be turning 50 next year. This means you will be eligible for a vaccine that prevents shingles, and I strongly recommend you receive it. Have you heard about this vaccine before? Can I answer your questions about it?” “I know you are not comfortable getting vaccinated today. I do want to make it clear that I recommend vaccines because I am convinced they are the best way to protect you from some serious diseases. Is there something that would lead you to think about getting vaccinated in the future?” TAILORED COMMUNICATION “I recommend that children and adults stay up to date on recommended vaccines. I see from your vaccine record that you’ve had your childhood vaccines, but you haven’t gotten any adult vaccines. I wanted to clarify whether this is because you decided not to get vaccines or something else prevented you from getting vaccinated.” “I understand that you are here for your pneumococcal vaccine. This is the best way to protect yourself and those around you from pneumonia. Do you have any questions before I give you the vaccine?” “I understand you have some concerns about vaccines. What are you most concerned about? Would you like me to explain why I recommend giving your child these vaccines?” TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY “Serious side effects can develop after MMR vaccination but are very rare. On average, 3 out of 10,000 children who get MMR vaccine will have a febrile seizure/ convulsion in the days after vaccination. Febrile seizures can be frightening, but nearly all children who have a febrile seizure recover very quickly and without any long-term consequences. On the other hand, 1 out of 1000 children who get measles will develop encephalitis (brain inflammation) that not only causes seizures but can also lead to permanent damage.” “About 10 out of every 10,000 Americans who do not get vaccinated against flu die because of influenza every year, and many more are hospitalized. While flu vaccine does not prevent all cases of influenza, it is the most effective vaccine we have. By getting the vaccine, you also help protect people around you from getting sick.” “You are correct, aluminum is used in some vaccines to help the body’s immune system respond. However, aluminum is also present in food and drinking water. In fact, the amount of aluminum present in vaccines is similar to or less than what is present in breast milk or infant formulas.” SUPPORT FROM ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION SOURCES “Your child and other boys and girls his age will be eligible for the human papillomavirus vaccine this coming school year. Have you heard about this vaccine before? What questions do you have about it? Here’s a list of websites for parents and teenagers that explain what it is about.” “There’s a lot of information about vaccines on the internet, and a lot of that information is not based on facts. Here is a list of websites that have been reviewed by health care professionals and accurately describe benefits and risks of each vaccine. The information is written in lay language and includes helpful illustrations.” REVISITING AND REINFORCEMENT OF THE RECOMMENDATION “During our last visit, we talked about MMR vaccine for your son and some of the concerns you had about potential side effects. Have you had a chance to look at the take-home information I gave you? Was there anything else you would like to ask about? I recommend that we vaccinate your child today.” “During our last visit, we talked about receiving a pertussis booster during pregnancy and where you can get vaccinated. Have you had a chance to get your pertussis vaccine?” “I see that you got your vaccines at the public health clinic last week. How did it go? Did you have any questions?” “It’s possible that the symptoms you experienced after receiving the vaccine were an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I will report this to the health authority. Let’s discuss what we can do next time to prevent symptoms from occurring again.” Note: Specific vaccine recommendations, vaccine eligibility guidelines, and statistics used to communicate benefits and risks will vary with the health jurisdiction and the country. Several sample statements here are adapted from the Australian National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance website (www. talkingaboutimmunisation.org.au). For patient vaccine information resources, see also the Immunization Action Coalition website for the public developed in partnership with the CDC (vaccineinformation.org). \n\n patients who accept vaccines should be seen at a follow-up appointment to confirm and document vaccine receipt (if vaccine is not given at the point of care), ascertain whether the vaccine was well tolerated, and reinforce the message about vaccine safety and effectiveness. Patients who actively demand vaccines usually do not require much follow-up other than to confirm and document the receipt of vaccine (if it is not given at the point of care) and to address additional questions or concerns arising subsequent to vaccination. Often this follow-up can be covered without an office visit. WHAT TO SAY TO VACCINE-HESITANT PATIENTS Engaging vaccine-hesitant individuals requires confidence, knowledge, skills, time, and creativity to tailor the approach to each individual patient. Examples for each part of the vaccine recommendation are listed in Table 3-2. \n\n#### ■ OTHER CONSIDERATIONS DURING CLINICAL \n\n#### ENCOUNTERS \n\n#### Missed Opportunities The World Health Organization defines \n\n a missed opportunity for vaccination as “any contact with health services by an individual (child or person of any age) who is eligible \n\n for vaccination (e.g., unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and free of contraindications to vaccination), which does not result in the person receiving one or more of the vaccine doses for which he or she is eligible.” HCPs who do not offer point-of-care vaccination frequently miss the opportunity to recommend vaccines to their patients. Missed opportunities for recommending and providing vaccines during routine health care encounters contribute to under-vaccination. Studies show that up to 45% of under-vaccinated children could be up to date with all ageappropriate vaccines and up to 90% of female adolescents could be up to date with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination if all opportunities to vaccinate were taken. Vaccine counseling and vaccination should be incorporated into clinical care for individuals of all ages, not just young children. Because many adolescents and adults do not have regular health care follow-up, providers need to take advantage of every health care encounter to recommend and provide vaccines. For example, a visit to an emergency department, a routine follow-up visit at a diabetes clinic, or a visit planning for elective orthopedic surgery offer opportunities to inquire about the patient’s vaccination status and to recommend vaccines. HCPs should make preemptive vaccine recommendations (e.g., initiating discussions about infant vaccines during pregnancy, informing parents about HPV vaccine before their child becomes eligible). Such advance discussions may be especially helpful in identifying \n\n---\n\n#### Vaccine Opposition and Hesitancy \n\n#### CHAPTER 3 \n\nvaccine-hesitant patients and ensuring that they have enough time to ask questions and make decisions before vaccines are due. HCPs should ensure that a vaccine recommendation is followed by vaccination. Providers who recommend vaccines but do not vaccinate at the point of care should inform patients where they can be vaccinated. This discussion may include information about public health clinics, travel clinics, and pharmacies or a referral to another provider. HCPs should follow up with their patients at subsequent appointments to confirm that they were vaccinated. \n\n#### Adverse Events Following Vaccination Although rare, adverse \n\nevents **(Chap. 123)** may influence vaccine acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated in the future. It is important for providers to identify and follow up with all patients who experience an adverse event, regardless of the patients’ vaccine attitudes prior to the event. Adverse events following vaccination should be reported to the relevant vaccine monitoring system: the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System or the Canadian Adverse Event Following Immunization Surveillance System. \n\n#### Addressing Inequities In Vaccine Access Discrepancies in \n\naccess to health care services create inequitable access to vaccines for children and adults and contribute to under-vaccination. A U.S. study found that socially disadvantaged individuals were more likely than other persons to be under-vaccinated, in part because of a lack of access to health care services. HCPs must recognize that socially disadvantaged individuals and populations are often at greater risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., as a result of crowded living conditions, limited access to sanitation, poor nutrition, or substance abuse) and also at greater risk of being under-vaccinated because they have limited access to health care services. In addition, specific vaccines may be recommended for some socially disadvantaged populations or communities. For example, in the wake of several outbreaks of hepatitis A among the U.S. homeless population, the CDC now recommends that everyone \u003e1 year of age experiencing homelessness receive hepatitis A vaccine. Depending on the setting and the patient, some recommended vaccines may not be covered through public funding or private insurance coverage. HCPs should be aware of alternative funding models, such as the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free vaccines for U.S. children (\u003c19 years of age) with financial barriers to vaccine access. When vaccines are not publicly funded or covered by private insurance and patients perceive that they cannot afford a vaccine, HCPs should not withhold a vaccine recommendation. The risks and benefits of vaccination still need to be communicated, with a strong recommendation, and the patient should be provided the opportunity to decide whether they can afford the vaccine. \n\n#### Further Communication With Patients Who Refuse Vaccines \n\nFortunately, the proportion of people who completely refuse all vaccines and are not willing to talk to their HCP is small. Nevertheless, in some cases, attempts to initiate discussion and address vaccine refusal may be futile. When possible, HCPs should focus on the common goals of care and preserve the therapeutic relationship. Vaccine refusal should be well documented in the patient’s chart. The HCP should continue with tailored communication and be open to future discussions. Vaccine demand and vaccine refusal are rarely static over time. **(See “Focus: COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy,” below.)** \n\n#### ■ CONCLUSION \n\nIn summary, vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific. It varies with time, place, patient, and vaccine. HCPs are well positioned to address vaccine hesitancy and should develop the skills, knowledge, and confidence to make strong vaccine recommendations to their patients. \n\n#### ■ FOCUS: COVID-19 VACCINE HESITANCY \n\nAs COVID-19 vaccines are used to control SARS-CoV-2, some individuals will have concerns about these vaccines and a proportion of \n\n the population will reject them. While worrisome, hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines is not unexpected; it mirrors public concerns expressed about past pandemic influenza vaccines and other newly introduced vaccines. It has been established that the newness of any vaccine, be it a pandemic influenza vaccine or a COVID-19 vaccine, raises concern in a large percentage of the population. Politicization of COVID-19 vaccines raises additional issues for some patients. \n\n#### Past Experience with New Vaccines Past experience with new \n\n vaccines, including the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009 and the human papillomavirus vaccine in the early 2000s, provides a guide to topics that need to be addressed with regard to COVID-19 vaccines. While resistance is often framed as uncertainty about a vaccine’s “newness,” further discussion translates this uncertainty into concern about the new vaccine’s safety. This concern encompasses both shortand long-term side effects. Frequent, acute adverse effects can be captured in clinical trial data, whereas worries about rare and long-term side effects can be addressed only by direct evidence after the initiation of a new vaccination program. In addition to queries about the overall safety of the vaccine, HCPs can expect specific questions regarding the safety of individual ingredients included in the vaccine, whether or not these ingredients are new and whether or not relevant safety data are available. Information on the incidence of common or expected health events in an unvaccinated population (i.e., background rates) over a 4-week period is helpful in distinguishing what is normal and expected from a point of concern. Studies that have examined this issue with regard to other vaccines can be used as a basis for presenting background rates of expected events in the context of COVID-19 vaccines for some groups; however, it is important to ensure that more specific background-rate information is available to HCPs with regard to the individual groups being vaccinated. HCPs, public health programs, and vaccine manufacturers can anticipate these questions and should develop answers and information to respond to them. \n\n#### Specific Concerns about COVID-19 Vaccines While some \n\n concerns can be anticipated on the basis of past experience with new vaccines, several characteristics of COVID-19 vaccines require new approaches to adequately address individual concerns, and HCPs need to educate themselves in several specific areas. First, an overwhelming amount of attention has been paid to the speed of development of COVID-19 vaccines, with some jurisdictions even skipping the usual clinical-trial steps in an effort to provide vaccine more rapidly to their populations. This situation directly increases concerns about the “newness” of the vaccine and its safety and, unfortunately, raises questions about the entire vaccine development process. Education is required to explain how a process that normally requires 5–10 years was condensed to this degree. (See Lurie et al [2020] for an excellent explanation of the COVID-19 vaccine development process.) In addition, transparency with regard to clinical trial data is required to enable scientists, HCPs, and consumers to read and understand the development and evaluation processes. The usually shrouded, proprietary development process is unsuitable if the final vaccine product is to garner public trust. Education on existing vaccine-safety monitoring systems also needs to be provided. HCPs must familiarize themselves with the vaccine development process and safety monitoring systems if they are to present this information to their patients. Second, several newer vaccine platforms that are being used for COVID-19 vaccines (e.g., nucleic acid–based vaccines, viral vector) have not been used in the past. This novelty exacerbates public concern about the unfamiliarity of new vaccines and further heightens misgivings about vaccine safety and the potential for long-term adverse effects. Again, HCPs need to familiarize themselves with the new technology and develop effective messaging for their patients. Public health officials have developed resources to address this issue (see http://www.cdc. gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence.html), but, even in the absence of such resources, HCPs can anticipate questions about the new technology involved and become comfortable explaining it. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n() The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is the most infamous example of medical experimentation in Black communities in the United States. (See Brandt [1978] for details.) Numerous examples of medical experimentation on Indigenous peoples are available. For example, a 12-year trial of an experimental bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine for tuberculosis was conducted on Cree and Nakoda Oyadebi infants in Saskatchewan during the 1930s. (See Lux [2016] for details.) Third, clinical trial safety and efficacy data were lacking for all groups initially prioritized to receive the vaccine. For example, longterm-care residents were prioritized for vaccine receipt, but clinical trial data were not available for the range of chronic health conditions that exist in older adults. While observational studies have filled some of these gaps, HCPs need to extrapolate on the basis of available evidence in considering individual patients and must make a recommendation without knowing all the answers. Fourth, some minority and marginalized communities who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 express hesitancy or reject COVID-19 vaccines. For some Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other communities, COVID-19 hesitancy stems directly from systematic discrimination, racism, and mistreatment in the health care system. Black and Indigenous communities also share a horrific legacy of unethical medical experimentation, which, when combined with current discrimination and overt racism, creates a powerful climate of mistrust in HCPs, the medical system, and science. \n\n#### Social and Cultural Trends The social and cultural trends \n\n already discussed in this chapter—in particular, traditional media, the Internet, and social media—are exerting influence and pressure that did not affect the introduction of older vaccines, even the H1N1 pandemic vaccines. The media attention given to the development of transverse myelitis in one clinical-trial participant following receipt of COVID-19 vaccine is but one example of the intense media scrutiny of the vaccine development process. Unfortunately, in the United States, efforts to control COVID-19, including vaccine development, have become highly politicized. This degree of politicization has not occurred with past vaccines, so HCPs are in uncharted territory in terms of how to address it or even to understand its potential influence on vaccine acceptance. Again, individual HCPs need to navigate complex conversations with their patients and possibly their communities. Below are some suggestions that may prove helpful in formulating these conversations. \n\n#### Tips for Discussion of COVID-19 Vaccines * ADDRESS \n\n CONCERNS ABOUT “NEWNESS” HCPs need to understand and be able to explain the newer vaccine platforms (mRNA, DNA, and viral vector vaccines) and to provide examples of other, older vaccines that have been developed by similar techniques. This information makes COVID-19 vaccines more familiar. ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT VACCINE SAFETY HCPs need to understand and explain how vaccines are evaluated before being approved for use and how vaccine safety is monitored after vaccines are used in the population. It is important to be honest and state that potential rare and long-term effects are not yet known, but then to speak to what is from the animal and clinical trial data and to comment on background rates for rare events. Placing potential vaccine risks in the context of known COVID-19 disease risks is helpful for some patients. Depending on the context, explain why specific high-risk groups may have been prioritized to receive the vaccine. Patients who have been prioritized may still need a strong recommendation from an HCP to accept the vaccine. An HCP recommendation is as important here as it is for acceptance of routine vaccines. As with other vaccines, many patients’ decision to accept a COVID-19 vaccine rests upon whether their HCP recommends it. \n\n Address implicit or overt racism and systemic discrimination in the medical system and create culturally safe health care spaces. HCPs need to be aware of the legacy of discrimination, racism, and medical experimentation and the distrust it fosters in some communities. While SARS-CoV-2 has critically highlighted fractures in our health care system for minority and marginalized communities, addressing these underlying issues goes beyond addressing vaccine hesitancy and is clearly needed for all types of medical care in these communities. EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING UP TO DATE WITH OTHER ROUTINE VACCINES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC These vaccines include but are not limited to seasonal influenza vaccine and the childhood primary vaccination series. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n#### Vaccine Hesitancy \n\n American Academy of Pediatrics: Vaccine hesitant parents.

What makes medical practice so difficult is not only the specialized technical knowledge required but also the intrinsic uncertainty that surrounds each decision. Mastering the technical aspects of medicine alone, unfortunately, does not ensure a mastery of the practice of medicine. Sir William Osler’s familiar quote “Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability” captures well this complex duality. Although the science of medicine is often taught as if the mechanisms of the human body operate with Newtonian predictability, every aspect of medical practice is infused with an element of irreducible uncertainty that the clinician ignores at her peril. Although deeply rooted in science, more than 100 years after the practice of medicine took its modern form, it remains at its core a craft, to which individual doctors bring varying levels of skill and understanding. With the exponential growth in medical literature and other technical information and an ever-increasing number of testing and treatment options, twenty-first century physicians who seek excellence in their craft must master a more diverse and complex set of skills than any of the generations that preceded them. This chapter provides an introduction to three of the pillars upon which the craft of modern medicine rests: (1) expertise in clinical reasoning (what it is and how it can be developed); (2) rational diagnostic test use and interpretation; and (3) integration of the best available research evidence with clinical judgment in the care of individual patients (evidence-based medicine [EBM]). \n\n#### ■ BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL REASONING \n\n#### Clinical Expertise Defining “clinical expertise” remains surpris\n\ningly difficult. Chess has an objective ranking system based on skill and performance criteria. Athletics, similarly, have ranking systems to distinguish novices from Olympians. But in medicine, after physicians complete training and pass the boards (or get recertified), no tests or benchmarks are used to identify those who have attained the highest levels of clinical performance. At each institution, there are often a few “elite” clinicians who are known for their “special problemsolving prowess” when particularly difficult or obscure cases have baffled everyone else. Yet despite their skill, even such master clinicians typically cannot explain their exact processes and methods, thereby limiting the acquisition and dissemination of the expertise used to achieve their impressive results. Furthermore, clinical virtuosity appears not to be generalizable, e.g., an expert on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be no better (and possibly worse) than a first-year medical resident at diagnosing and managing a patient with neutropenia, fever, and hypotension. Broadly construed, clinical expertise encompasses not only cognitive dimensions involving the integration of disease knowledge with verbal and visual cues and test interpretation but also potentially the complex fine-motor skills necessary for invasive procedures and tests. In addition, “the complete package” of expertise in medicine requires effective communication and care coordination with patients and members of the medical team. Research on medical expertise remains sparse overall and mostly centered on diagnostic reasoning, so in this chapter, we focus primarily on the cognitive elements of clinical reasoning. Because clinical reasoning occurs in the heads of clinicians, objective study of the process is difficult. One research method used for this area asks clinicians to “think out loud” as they receive increments of clinical information in a manner meant to simulate a clinical encounter. Another research approach focuses on how doctors should reason diagnostically, to identify remediable “errors,” rather than on how they actually do reason. Much of what is known about clinical \n\n# 4 \n\n## Decision-Making in \n\n## Clinical Medicine \n\n Daniel B. Mark, John B. Wong \n\n reasoning comes from empirical studies of nonmedical problemsolving behavior. Because of the diverse perspectives contributing to this area, with important contributions from cognitive psychology, medical education, behavioral economics, sociology, informatics, and decision sciences, no single integrated model of clinical reasoning exists, and not infrequently, different terms and reasoning models describe similar phenomena. \n\n#### Intuitive Versus Analytic Reasoning A useful contemporary \n\n model of reasoning, the dual-process theory distinguishes two general conceptual modes of thinking as fast or slow. Intuition (System 1) provides rapid effortless judgments from memorized associations using pattern recognition and other simplifying “rules of thumb” (i.e., heuristics). For example, a very simple pattern that could be useful in certain situations is “black woman plus hilar adenopathy equals sarcoid.” Because no effort is involved in recalling the pattern, the clinician is often unable to say how those judgments were formulated. In contrast, Analysis (System 2), the other form of reasoning in the dual-process model, is slow, methodical, deliberative, and effortful. A student might read about causes of hilar adenopathy and from that list (e.g., Chap. 66 ), identify diseases more common in black women or examine the patient for skin or eye findings that occur with sarcoid. These dual processes, of course, represent two exemplars taken from the cognitive continuum. They provide helpful descriptive insights but very little guidance in how to develop expertise in clinical reasoning. How these idealized systems interact in different decision problems, how experts use them differently from novices, and when their use can lead to errors in judgment remain the subject of study and considerable debate. Pattern recognition, an important part of System 1 reasoning, is a complex cognitive process that appears largely effortless. One can recognize people’s faces, the breed of a dog, an automobile model, or a piece of music from just a few notes within milliseconds without necessarily being able to articulate the specific features that prompted the recognition. Analogously, experienced clinicians often recognize familiar diagnostic patterns very quickly. The key here is having a large library of stored patterns that can be rapidly accessed. In the absence of an extensive stored repertoire of diagnostic patterns, students (as well as experienced clinicians operating outside their area of expertise and familiarity) often must use the more laborious System 2 analytic approach along with more intensive and comprehensive data collection to reach the diagnosis. The following brief patient scenarios illustrate three distinct patterns associated with hemoptysis that experienced clinicians recognize without effort: \n\n- A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint     of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy, nonsmoker, he is recovering     from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests     that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute     bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that     a more serious disorder is absent. \n\n- In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief     complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive     morning cough with blood-streaked sputum, and weight loss fits     the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the     chest x-ray, the clinician obtains a sputum cytology examination and     refers this patient for a chest CT scan. \n\n- In the third scenario, the clinician hears a soft diastolic rumbling     murmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation in a 46-year-old patient     with hemoptysis who immigrated from a developing country and     orders an echocardiogram as well, because of possible pulmonary     hypertension from suspected rheumatic mitral stenosis. \n\n Pattern recognition by itself is not, however, sufficient for secure diagnosis. Without deliberative systematic reflection, undisciplined pattern recognition can result in premature closure: mistakenly jumping to the conclusion that one has the correct diagnosis before all the relevant data are in. A critical second step, therefore, even when the diagnosis seems obvious, is diagnostic verification: considering whether \n\u003c!--ID: 1660788425461--\u003e\n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n the diagnosis adequately accounts for the presenting symptoms and signs and can explain all the ancillary findings. The following case based on a real clinical encounter provides an example of premature closure. A 45-year-old man presents with a 3-week history of a “flulike” upper respiratory infection (URI) including dyspnea and a productive cough. The emergency department (ED) clinician pulled out a “URI assessment form,” which defines and standardizes the information gathered. After quickly acquiring the requisite structured examination components and noting in particular the absence of fever and a clear chest examination, the physician prescribed a cough suppressant for acute bronchitis and reassured the patient that his illness was not serious. Following a sleepless night at home with significant dyspnea, the patient developed nausea and vomiting and collapsed. He was brought back to the ED in cardiac arrest and was unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy showed a posterior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? Presumably, the ED clinician felt that the patient was basically healthy (one can be misled by the way the patient appears on examination—a patient that does not appear “sick” may be incorrectly assumed to have an innocuous illness). So, in this case, the physician, upon hearing the overview of the patient from the triage nurse, elected to use the URI assessment protocol even before starting the history, closing consideration of the broader range of possibilities and associated tests required to confirm or refute these possibilities. In particular, by concentrating on the abbreviated and focused URI protocol, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which was precipitated by exertion and accompanied by chest heaviness and relieved by rest, suggesting a far more serious disorder. Heuristics or rules of thumb are a part of the intuitive system. These cognitive shortcuts provide a quick and easy path to reaching conclusions and making choices, but when used improperly, they can lead to errors. Two major research programs have studied heuristics in a mostly nonmedical context and have reached very different conclusions about the value of these cognitive tools. The “heuristics and biases” program focuses on how these mental shortcuts can lead to incorrect judgments. So far, however, little evidence exists that educating physicians and other decision makers to watch for the \u003e100 cognitive biases identified to date has had any effect on the rate of diagnostic errors. In contrast, the “fast and frugal heuristics” research program explores how and when relying on simple heuristics can produce good decisions. Although many heuristics have relevance to clinical reasoning, only four will be mentioned here. When diagnosing patients, clinicians usually develop diagnostic hypotheses based on the similarity of that patient’s symptoms, signs, and other data to their mental representations (memorized patterns) of the disease possibilities. In other words, clinicians pattern match to identify the diagnoses that share the most similar findings to the patient at hand. This cognitive shortcut is called the representativeness heuristic. Consider a patient with hypertension who has headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Based on the representativeness heuristic, clinicians might judge pheochromocytoma to be quite likely given this classic presenting symptom triad suggesting pheochromocytoma. Doing so, however, would be incorrect given that other causes of hypertension are much more common than pheochromocytoma and this triad of symptoms can occur in patients who do not have it. Thus, clinicians using the representativeness heuristic may overestimate the likelihood of a particular disease based on the presence of representative symptoms and signs, failing to account for its low underlying prevalence (i.e., the prior, or pretest, probabilities). Conversely, atypical presentations of common diseases may lead to underestimating the likelihood of a particular disease. Thus, inexperience with a specific disease and with the breadth of its presentations may also lead to diagnostic delays or errors, e.g., diseases that affect multiple organ systems, such as sarcoid or tuberculosis, may be particularly challenging to diagnose because of the many different patterns they may manifest. A second commonly used cognitive shortcut, the availability heuristic, involves judgments based on how easily prior similar cases or outcomes can be brought to mind. For example, a clinician may recall \n\n a case from a morbidity and mortality conference in which an elderly patient presented with painless dyspnea of acute onset and was evaluated for a pulmonary cause but was eventually found to have acute MI, with the diagnostic delay likely contributing to the development of ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the case was associated with a malpractice accusation, such examples may be even more memorable. Errors with the availability heuristic arise from several sources of recall bias. Rare catastrophic outcomes become memorable cases with a clarity and force disproportionate to their likelihood for future diagnosis—for example, a patient with a sore throat eventually found to have leukemia or a young athlete with leg pain subsequently found to have an osteosarcoma—and those publicized in the media or recently experienced are, of course, easier to recall and therefore more influential on clinical judgments. The third commonly used cognitive shortcut, the anchoring heuristic (also called conservatism or stickiness), involves insufficiently adjusting the initial probability of disease up (or down) following a positive (or negative test) when compared with Bayes’ theorem, i.e., sticking to the initial diagnosis. For example, a clinician may still judge the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) to be high despite a negative exercise perfusion test and go on to cardiac catheterization (see “Measures of Disease Probability and Bayes’ Rule,” below). The fourth heuristic states that clinicians should use the simplest explanation possible that will adequately account for the patient’s symptoms and findings (Occam’s razor or, alternatively, the simplicity heuristic). Although this is an attractive and often used principle, it is important to remember that no biologic basis for it exists. Errors from the simplicity heuristic include premature closure leading to the neglect of unexplained significant symptoms or findings. For complex or unfamiliar diagnostic problems, clinicians typically resort to analytic reasoning processes (System 2) and proceed methodically using the hypothetico-deductive model of reasoning. Based on the patient’s stated reasons for seeking medical attention, clinicians develop an initial list of diagnostic possibilities in hypothesis generation. During the history of the present illness, the initial hypotheses evolve in diagnostic refinement as emerging information is tested against the mental models of the diseases being considered with diagnoses increasing and decreasing in likelihood or even being dropped from consideration as the working hypotheses of the moment. These mental models often generate additional questions that distinguish the diagnostic possibilities from one another. The focused physical examination contributes to further distinguishing the working hypotheses. Is the spleen enlarged? How big is the liver? Is it tender? Are there any palpable masses or nodules? Diagnostic verification involves testing the adequacy (whether the diagnosis accounts for all symptoms and signs) and coherency (whether the signs and symptoms are consistent with the underlying pathophysiologic causal mechanism) of the working diagnosis. For example, if the enlarged and quite tender liver felt on physical examination is due to acute hepatitis (the hypothesis), then certain specific liver function tests will be markedly elevated (the prediction). Should the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have to be discarded and others reconsidered. Although often neglected, negative findings are as important as positive ones because they reduce the likelihood of the diagnostic hypotheses under consideration. Chest discomfort that is not provoked or worsened by exertion and not relieved by rest in an active patient lowers the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart disease is the underlying cause. The absence of a resting tachycardia and thyroid gland enlargement reduces the likelihood of hyperthyroidism in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The acuity of a patient’s illness may override considerations of prevalence and the other issues described above. “Diagnostic imperatives” recognize the significance of relatively rare but potentially catastrophic conditions if undiagnosed and untreated. For example, clinicians should consider aortic dissection routinely as a possible cause of acute severe chest discomfort. Although the typical presenting symptoms of dissection differ from those of MI, dissection may mimic MI, and because it is far less prevalent and potentially fatal if mistreated, diagnosing dissection remains a challenging diagnostic imperative (Chap. 280). \n\n---\n\n#### Decision-Making in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 4 \n\nClinicians taking care of acute, severe chest pain patients should explicitly and routinely inquire about symptoms suggestive of dissection, measure blood pressures in both arms for discrepancies, and examine for pulse deficits. When these are all negative, clinicians may feel sufficiently reassured to discard the aortic dissection hypothesis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, the hypothesis should be reinstated and an appropriate imaging test ordered (e.g., thoracic computed tomography [CT] scan or transesophageal echocardiogram). In nonacute situations, the prevalence of potential alternative diagnoses should play a much more prominent role in diagnostic hypothesis generation. Cognitive scientists studying the thought processes of expert clinicians have observed that clinicians group data into packets, or “chunks,” that are stored in short-term or “working memory” and manipulated to generate diagnostic hypotheses. Because short-term memory is limited (classically humans can accurately repeat a list of 7 ± 2 numbers read to them), the number of diagnoses that can be actively considered in hypothesis-generating activities is similarly limited. For this reason, the cognitive shortcuts discussed above play a key role in the generation of diagnostic hypotheses, many of which are discarded as rapidly as they are formed, thereby demonstrating that the distinction between analytic and intuitive reasoning is an arbitrary and simplistic, but nonetheless useful, representation of cognition. Research into the hypothetico-deductive model of reasoning has had difficulty identifying the elements of the reasoning process that distinguish experts from novices. This has led to a shift from examining the problem-solving process of experts to analyzing the organization of their knowledge for pattern matching as exemplars, prototypes, and illness scripts. For example, diagnosis may be based on the resemblance of a new case to patients seen previously (exemplars). As abstract mental models of disease, prototypes incorporate the likelihood of various disease features. Illness scripts include risk factors, pathophysiology, and symptoms and signs. Experts have a much larger store of exemplar and prototype cases, an example of which is the visual long-term memory of experienced radiologists. However, clinicians do not simply rely on literal recall of specific cases but have constructed elaborate conceptual networks of memorized information or models of disease to aid in arriving at their conclusions (illness scripts). That is, expertise involves an enhanced ability to connect symptoms, signs, and risk factors to one another in meaningful ways; relate those findings to possible diagnoses; and identify the additional information necessary to confirm the diagnosis. No single theory accounts for all the key features of expertise in medical diagnosis. Experts have more knowledge about presenting symptoms of diseases and a larger repertoire of cognitive tools to employ in problem solving than nonexperts. One definition of expertise highlights the ability to make powerful distinctions. In this sense, expertise involves a working knowledge of the diagnostic possibilities and those features that distinguish one disease from another. Memorization alone is insufficient, e.g., photographic memory of a medical textbook would not make one an expert. But having access to detailed case-specific relevant information is critically important. In the past, clinicians primarily acquired clinical knowledge through their patient experiences, but now clinicians have access to a plethora of information sources. Clinicians of the future will be able to leverage the experiences of large numbers of other clinicians using electronic tools, but, as with the memorized textbook, the data alone will be insufficient for becoming an expert. Nonetheless, availability of these data removes one barrier for acquiring experience with connecting symptoms, signs, and risk factors to the possible diagnoses and identifying the additional distinguishing information necessary to confirm the diagnosis, thereby potentially facilitating the development of the working knowledge necessary for becoming an expert. Despite all of the research seeking to understand expertise in medicine and other disciplines, it remains uncertain whether any didactic program can actually accelerate the progression from novice to expert or from experienced clinician to master clinician. Deliberate effortful practice (over an extended period of time, sometimes said to be 10 years or 10,000 practice hours) and personal coaching are two strategies often used outside medicine (e.g., music, athletics, chess) to cultivate \n\n expertise. Their use in developing medical expertise and maintaining or enhancing it has not yet been adequately explored. Some studies in medicine suggest that the most beneficial approach to education exposes students to both the signs and symptoms of specific diseases (disease pattern recognition) and, in addition, the lists of diseases that can present with specific symptoms and signs (differential diagnosis). Active learning opportunities useful for those in training include developing a personal learning system, e.g., systematically reflecting on diagnostic processes used (metacognition) and following-up to identify diagnoses and treatments for patients in their care. \n\n#### ■ DIAGNOSTIC VERSUS THERAPEUTIC \n\n#### DECISION-MAKING \n\n The modern ideal of medical therapeutic decision-making is to “personalize” treatment recommendations. In the abstract, personalizing treatment involves combining the best available evidence about what works with an individual patient’s unique features (e.g., risk factors, genomics, and comorbidities) and his or her preferences and health goals to craft an optimal treatment recommendation with the patient. Operationally, two different and complementary levels of personalization are possible: individualizing the risk of harm and benefit for the options being considered based on the specific patient characteristics (precision medicine), and personalizing the therapeutic decision process by incorporating the patient’s preferences and values for the possible health outcomes. This latter process is sometimes referred to as shared decision-making and typically involves clinicians sharing their knowledge about the options and the associated consequences and trade-offs and patients sharing their health goals (e.g., avoiding a short-term risk of dying from coronary artery bypass grafting to see their grandchild get married in a few months). Individualizing the evidence about therapy does not mean relying on physician impressions of benefit and harm from their personal experience. Because of small sample sizes and rare events, the chance of drawing erroneous causal inferences from one’s own clinical experience is very high. For most chronic diseases, therapeutic effectiveness is only demonstrable statistically in large patient populations. It would be incorrect to infer with any certainty, for example, that treating a hypertensive patient with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors necessarily prevented a stroke from occurring during treatment, or that an untreated patient would definitely have avoided their stroke had they been treated. For many chronic diseases, a majority of patients will remain event free regardless of treatment choices; some will have events regardless of which treatment is selected; and those who avoided having an event through treatment cannot be individually identified. Blood pressure lowering, a readily observable surrogate endpoint, does not have a tightly coupled relationship with strokes prevented. Consequently, in most situations, demonstrating therapeutic effectiveness cannot rely simply on observing the outcome of an individual patient but should instead be based on large groups of patients carefully studied and properly analyzed. Therapeutic decision-making, therefore, should be based on the best available evidence from clinical trials and well-done outcome studies. Trustworthy clinical practice guidelines that synthesize such evidence offer normative guidance for many testing and treatment decisions. However, all guidelines recognize that “one size fits all” recommendations may not apply to individual patients. Increased research into the heterogeneity of treatment effects seeks to understand how best to adjust group-level clinical evidence of treatment harms and benefits to account for the absolute level of risks faced by subgroups and even by individual patients, using, for example, validated clinical risk scores. \n\n#### ■ NONCLINICAL INFLUENCES ON CLINICAL \n\n#### DECISION-MAKING \n\n More than three decades of research on variations in clinician practice patterns has identified important nonclinical forces that shape clinical decisions. These factors can be grouped conceptually into three overlapping categories: (1) factors related to an individual physician’s practice, (2) factors related to practice setting, and (3) factors related to payment systems. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n#### Factors Related to Practice Style To ensure that necessary care \n\n is provided at a high level of quality, physicians fulfill a key role in medical care by serving as the patient’s advocate. Factors that influence performance in this role include the physician’s knowledge, training, and experience. Clearly, physicians cannot practice EBM if they are unfamiliar with the evidence. As would be expected, specialists generally know the evidence in their field better than do generalists. Beyond published evidence and practice guidelines, a major set of influences on physician practice can be subsumed under the general concept of “practice style.” The practice style serves to define norms of clinical behavior. Differing practice styles may be based on training, personal experience, and medical evidence. Beliefs about effectiveness of different therapies and preferred patterns of diagnostic test use are examples of different facets of a practice style. For example, cardiologists evaluating patients with lower risk chest pain symptoms often conceptualize their primary diagnostic objective as maximizing the detection of ischemia. For this reason, they may strongly favor stress imaging. Internists caring for the same patients may be more comfortable with initial use of exercise ECG testing without imaging. This latter practice style focuses less on ischemia detection and more on following guideline recommendations that indicate no outcome advantage for stress imaging in this context. Cardiologist may also favor a more liberal use of coronary angiography and revascularization in patients with stable ischemic symptoms relative to general internists. Beyond the patient’s welfare, physician perceptions about the risk of a malpractice suit resulting from either an erroneous decision or a bad outcome may drive clinical decisions and create a practice referred to as defensive medicine. This practice involves ordering tests and therapies with very small marginal benefits, ostensibly to preclude future criticism should an adverse outcome occur. With conscious or unconscious awareness of a connection to the risk of litigation or to payment, however, over time, such patterns of care may become accepted as part of the practice norm, thereby perpetuating their overuse, e.g., annual cardiac exercise testing in asymptomatic patients. \n\n#### Practice Setting Factors Factors in this category relate to work \n\n systems including tasks and workflow (interruptions, inefficiencies, workload), technology (poor design or implementation, errors in use, failure, misuse), organizational characteristics (e.g., culture, leadership, staffing, scheduling), and the physical environment (e.g., noise, lighting, layout). Physician-induced demand is a term that refers to the repeated observation that once medical facilities and technologies become available to physicians, they will find ways to use them. Other environmental factors that can influence decision-making include the local availability of specialists for consultations and procedures; “hightech” advanced imaging or procedure facilities such as MRI machines and proton beam therapy centers; and fragmentation of care. \n\n#### Payment Systems Economic incentives are closely related to the \n\n other two categories of practice-modifying factors. Financial issues can exert both stimulatory and inhibitory influences on clinical practice. Historically, physicians are paid on a fee-for-service, capitation, or salary basis. In fee-for-service, physicians who do more get paid more, thereby encouraging overuse, consciously or unconsciously. When fees are reduced (discounted reimbursement), clinicians tend to increase the number of services provided to maintain revenue. Capitation, in contrast, provides a fixed payment per patient per year to encourage physicians to consider a global population budget in managing individual patients and ideally reducing the use of interventions with small marginal benefit. To discourage volume-based excessive utilization, fixed salary compensation plans pay physicians the same regardless of the clinical effort expended but may provide an (unintended) incentive to see fewer patients. In recognition of the nonsustainability of continued growth in medical expenditures and the opportunity costs associated with that (funds that might be more beneficially applied to education, energy, social welfare, or defense), current efforts seek to transition to a value-based payment system to reduce overuse and to reflect benefit. Work to define how to actually tie payment to value has mostly focused so far on “pay for performance” models. High-quality \n\n clinical trial evidence for the effectiveness of these models is still mostly lacking. \n\n#### ■ INTERPRETATION OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS \n\n Despite impressive technological advances in medicine over the past century, uncertainty still abounds and challenges all aspects of medical decision-making. Compounding this challenge, massive information overload characterizes modern medicine. Clinicians on average subscribe to seven journals, presenting them with \u003e2500 new articles each year, and need access to 2 million pieces of information to practice medicine. Of course, to be useful, this information must be sifted for quality and examined for applicability for integration into patientspecific care. Although computers appear to offer an obvious solution both for information management and for quantification of medical care uncertainties, many practical problems remain to be solved before computerized decision support can be routinely incorporated into the clinical reasoning process in a way that demonstrably improves the quality of care. For the present, understanding the nature of diagnostic test information can help clinicians become more efficient users of such data. The next section reviews select concepts related to diagnostic testing. \n\n#### ■ DIAGNOSTIC TESTING: MEASURES OF TEST \n\n#### ACCURACY \n\n The purpose of performing a test on a patient is to reduce uncertainty about the patient’s diagnosis or prognosis in order to facilitate appropriate management. Although diagnostic tests commonly refer to laboratory (e.g., blood count) or imaging tests or procedures (e.g., colonoscopy or bronchoscopy), any information that changes a provider’s understanding of the patient’s problem qualifies as a diagnostic test. Thus, even the history and physical examination can be considered as diagnostic tests. In clinical medicine, it is common to reduce the results of a test to a dichotomous outcome, such as positive or negative, normal or abnormal. Although this simplification often suppresses useful information (such as the degree of abnormality), it facilitates illustrating some important principles of test interpretation that are described below. The accuracy of any diagnostic test is assessed relative to a “gold standard,” where a positive gold standard test defines the patients who have disease and a negative test securely rules out disease (Table 4-1). Characterizing the diagnostic performance of a new test requires identifying an appropriate population (ideally, patients representative of those in whom the new test would be used) and applying both the new and the gold standard tests to all subjects. Biased estimates of test performance occur when diagnostic accuracy is defined using an inappropriate population or one in which gold standard determination of disease status is incomplete. The accuracy of the new test in distinguishing disease from health is determined relative to the gold standard results and summarized in four estimates. The sensitivity or true-positive rate reflects how well the new test identifies patients with disease. It is the proportion of patients with disease (defined by the gold standard) who have a positive test. The proportion of patients with disease who have a negative test is the false-negative rate, calculated as 1 – sensitivity. The specificity, or true-negative rate, reflects how well \n\n TABLE 4-1 Measures of Diagnostic Test Accuracy DISEASE STATUS TEST RESULT PRESENT ABSENT Positive True positives (TP) False positives (FP) Negative False negatives (FN) True negatives (TN) Test Characteristics in Patients with Disease True-positive rate (sensitivity) = TP/(TP + FN) False-negative rate = FN/(TP + FN) = 1 – true-positive rate Test Characteristics in Patients without Disease True-negative rate (specificity) = TN/(TN + FP) False-positive rate = FP/(TN + FP) = 1 – true-negative rate \n\n---\n\n#### Decision-Making in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 4 \n\nthe new test correctly identifies patients without disease. It is the proportion of patients without disease (defined by the gold standard) who have a negative test. The proportion of patients without disease who have positive test is the false-positive rate, calculated as 1 – specificity. In theory, a perfect test would be one with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% and would completely distinguish patients with disease from those without it. A useful mnemonic to help remember the somewhat paradoxical relationship between what the test is best at technically versus what it is most useful for clinically is: a test with a very high sensitivity (Sn) when negative (N) helps rule out (out) disease (SnNout), and a test with a very high specificity (Sp) when positive (P) helps rule in (in) disease (SpPin). Calculating sensitivity and specificity requires selection of a threshold value or cut point above which the test is considered “positive.” Making the cut point “stricter” (e.g., raising it) lowers sensitivity but improves specificity, while making it “laxer” (e.g., lowering it) raises sensitivity but lowers specificity. This dynamic trade-off between more accurate identification of subjects with disease versus those without disease is often displayed graphically as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve **(Fig. 4-1)** by plotting sensitivity (y axis) versus 1 – specificity (x axis). Each point on the curve represents a potential cut point with an associated sensitivity and specificity value. The area under the ROC curve often is used as a quantitative measure of the information content of a test. Values range from 0.5 (no diagnostic information from testing at all; the test is equivalent to flipping a coin) to 1.0 (perfect test). The choice of cut point should in theory reflect the relative harms and benefits of treatment for those without versus those with disease. For example, if treatment was safe with substantial benefit, then choosing a high-sensitivity cut point (upper right of the ROC curve) for a low-risk test may be appropriate (e.g., phenylketonuria in newborns), but if treatment had substantial risk for harm, then choosing a high-specificity cut point (lower left of the ROC curve) may be appropriate (e.g., chemotherapy for cancer). The choice of cut point may also depend on the prevalence of disease, with low prevalence placing a greater emphasis on the harms of false-positive tests (e.g., HIV testing in marriage applicants) or the harms of false-negative tests (e.g., HIV testing in blood donors). \n\n#### ■ MEASURES OF DISEASE PROBABILITY AND \n\n#### BAYES’ RULE \n\n In the absence of perfect tests, the true disease state of the patient remains uncertain after every test. Bayes’ rule provides a way to quantify the revised uncertainty using simple probability mathematics (and thereby avoid anchoring bias). It calculates the posttest probability, or likelihood of disease after a test result, from three parameters: the pretest probability of disease, the test sensitivity, and the test specificity. The pretest probability is a quantitative estimate of the likelihood of the diagnosis before the test is performed and is usually estimated from the prevalence of the disease in the underlying population (if known) or clinical context (e.g., age, sex, and type of chest pain). For some common conditions, such as CAD, existing nomograms and statistical models generate estimates of pretest probability that account for history, physical examination, and test findings. The posttest probability (also called the predictive value of the test, see below) is a recalibrated statement of the probability of the diagnosis, accounting for both pretest probability and test results. For the probability of disease following a positive test (i.e., positive predictive value), Bayes’ rule is calculated as: \n\n = \n\n##### × \n\n##### ×+ \n\n##### × \n\n Posttest probability \n\n Pretestprobability test sensitivity Pretestprobability test sensitivity (1–Pretestprobability) (false-positivetestrate) \n\n For example, consider a 64-year-old woman with atypical chest pain who has a pretest probability of 0.50 and a “positive” diagnostic test result (assuming test sensitivity = 0.90 and specificity = 0.90). \n\n##### = \n\n##### + \n\n##### = \n\n Posttest probability \n\n##### (0.50)(0.90) \n\n##### (0.50)(0.90) (0.50)(0.10) \n\n##### 0.90 \n\n The term predictive value has often been used as a synonym for the posttest probability. Unfortunately, clinicians commonly misinterpret reported predictive values as intrinsic measures of test accuracy rather than calculated probabilities. Studies of diagnostic test performance compound the confusion by calculating predictive values from the same sample used to measure sensitivity and specificity. Such calculations are misleading unless the test is applied subsequently to populations with exactly the same disease prevalence. For these reasons, the term predictive value is best avoided in favor of the more descriptive posttest probability following a positive or a negative test result. The nomogram version of Bayes’ rule (Fig. 4-2) helps us to understand at a conceptual level how it estimates the posttest probability of disease. In this nomogram, the impact of the diagnostic test result is summarized by the likelihood ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the probability of a given test result (e.g., “positive” or “negative”) in a patient with disease to the probability of that result in a patient without disease, thereby providing a measure of how well the test distinguishes those with from those without disease. The likelihood ratio for a positive test is calculated as the ratio of the true-positive rate to the false-positive rate (or sensitivity/[1 – specificity]). For example, a test with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.90 has a likelihood ratio of 0.90/(1 – 0.90), or 9. Thus, for this hypothetical test, a “positive” result is 9 times more likely in a patient with the disease than in a patient without it. Most tests in medicine have likelihood ratios for a positive result between 1.5 and 20. Higher values are associated with tests that more substantially increase the posttest likelihood of disease. A very high likelihood ratio positive (\u003e10) usually implies high specificity, so a positive high specificity test helps “rule in” disease (the “SpPin” mnemonic introduced earlier). If sensitivity is excellent but specificity is less so, the likelihood ratio positive will be reduced substantially (e.g., with a 90% sensitivity but a 55% specificity, the likelihood ratio positive is 2.0). The corresponding likelihood ratio for a negative test is the ratio of the false-negative rate to the true-negative rate (or [1 – sensitivity]/specificity). \n\n Good Fair No predictive value \n\n 1 \n\n 0.9 \n\n 0.8 \n\n 0.7 \n\n 0.6 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 0.4 \n\n 0.3 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 0 \n\n Tr ue-positive \n\n ra \n\n te \n\n 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 False-positive rate \n\n 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 \n\n**FIGURE 4-1 Each receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve)** illustrates a tradeoff that occurs between improved test sensitivity (accurate detection of patients with disease) and improved test specificity (accurate detection of patients without disease), as the test value defining when the test turns from “negative” to “positive” is varied. A 45° line would indicate a test with no predictive value (sensitivity = specificity at every test value). The area under each ROC curve is a measure of the information content of the test. Thus, a larger ROC area signifies increased diagnostic accuracy. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n 99 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 5 \n\n 0.01 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 5 \n\n 10 \n\n 20 \n\n 30 \n\n 40 \n\n 50 \n\n 60 \n\n 70 \n\n 80 \n\n 90 \n\n 95 \n\n 98 \n\n 99 \n\n 0.02 \n\n 0.05 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 10 \n\n 99 \n\n 98 \n\n 95 \n\n 90 \n\n 80 \n\n 70 \n\n 60 \n\n 50 \n\n 40 \n\n 30 \n\n 20 \n\n 10 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 5 \n\n 10 \n\n 20 \n\n 50 \n\n 0.01 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 1 \n\n 2 \n\n 5 \n\n 10 \n\n 20 \n\n 30 \n\n 40 \n\n 50 \n\n 60 \n\n 70 \n\n 80 \n\n 90 \n\n 95 \n\n 98 \n\n 99 \n\n 0.02 \n\n 0.05 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 5 \n\n 2 \n\n 1 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 0.2 \n\n 0.1 \n\n 20 \n\n 50 \n\n 98 \n\n 95 \n\n 90 \n\n 80 \n\n 70 \n\n 60 \n\n 50 \n\n 40 \n\n 30 \n\n 20 \n\n 10 \n\n 5 \n\n 2 \n\n 1 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 0.5 \n\n 0.1 \n\n Pretest Probability, % \n\n Posttest Probability, % \n\n Likelihood Ratio \n\n Pretest Probability, % \n\n Posttest Probability, % \n\n Likelihood Ratio FIGURE 4-2 Nomogram version of Bayes’ theorem used to predict the posttest probability of disease (right-hand scale) using the pretest probability of disease (left-hand scale) and the likelihood ratio for a positive or a negative test (middle scale). See text for information on calculation of likelihood ratios. To use, place a straightedge connecting the pretest probability and the likelihood ratio and read off the posttest probability. The right-hand part of the figure illustrates the value of a positive exercise treadmill test (likelihood ratio 4, green line) and a positive exercise thallium single-photon emission CT perfusion study (likelihood ratio 9, broken yellow line) in a patient with a pretest probability of coronary artery disease of 50%. (Adapted from Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Likelihood ratios. Available at http://www. cebm.net/likelihood-ratios/.) \n\n Lower likelihood ratio negative values more substantially lower the posttest likelihood of disease. A very low likelihood ratio negative (falling below 0.10) usually implies high sensitivity, so a negative high sensitivity test helps “rule out” disease (the SnNout mnemonic). The hypothetical test considered above with a sensitivity of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.9 would have a likelihood ratio for a negative test result of (1 – 0.9)/0.9, or 0.11, meaning that a negative result is about onetenth as likely in patients with disease than in those without disease (or about 10 times more likely in those without disease than in those with disease). \n\n#### ■ APPLICATIONS TO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING IN CAD \n\n Consider two tests commonly used in the diagnosis of CAD: an exercise treadmill and an exercise single-photon emission CT (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging test (Chap. 241). A positive treadmill ST-segment response has an average sensitivity of ~60% and an average specificity of ~75%, yielding a likelihood ratio positive of 2.4 (0.60/ [1 – 0.75]) (consistent with modest discriminatory ability because it falls between 2 and 5). For a 41-year-old man with nonanginal pain and a 10% pretest probability of CAD, the posttest probability of disease after a positive result rises to only ~30%. For a 60-year-old woman with typical angina and a pretest probability of CAD of 80%, a positive test result raises the posttest probability of disease to ~95%. In contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more accurate for diagnosis of CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding of a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a sensitivity and \n\n a specificity of 90% (a bit higher than reported), yielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 (0.90/[1 – 0.90]) (consistent with intermediate discriminatory ability because it falls between 5 and 10). For the same 10% pretest probability patient, a positive test raises the probability of CAD to 50% (Fig. 4-2). However, despite the differences in posttest probabilities between these two tests (30 vs 50%), the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g., decision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more accurate test has only moved the physician from being fairly certain that the patient did not have CAD to a 50:50 chance of disease. In a patient with a pretest probability of 80%, exercise SPECT test raises the posttest probability to 97% (compared with 95% for the exercise treadmill). Again, the more accurate test does not provide enough improvement in posttest confidence to alter management, and neither test has improved much on what was known from clinical data alone. In general, positive results with an accurate test (e.g., likelihood ratio for a positive test of 10) when the pretest probability is low (e.g., 20%) do not move the posttest probability to a range high enough to rule in disease (e.g., 80%). In screening situations, pretest probabilities are often particularly low because patients are asymptomatic. In such cases, specificity becomes especially important. For example, in screening first-time female blood donors without risk factors for HIV, a positive test raised the likelihood of HIV to only 67% despite a specificity of 99.995% because the prevalence was 0.01%. Conversely, with a high pretest probability, a negative test may not rule out disease adequately if it is not sufficiently sensitive. Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likelihood following a test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain (i.e., pretest probability between 30 and 70%). For example, in patients with a pretest probability for CAD of 50%, a positive exercise treadmill test moves the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise SPECT perfusion test moves it to 90% (Fig. 4-2). As presented above, Bayes’ rule employs a number of important simplifications that should be considered. First, few tests provide only “positive” or “negative” results. Many tests have multidimensional outcomes (e.g., extent of ST-segment depression, exercise duration, and exercise-induced symptoms with exercise testing). Although Bayes’ theorem can be adapted to this more detailed test result format, it is computationally more complex to do so. Similarly, when multiple sequential tests are performed, the posttest probability may be used as the pretest probability to interpret the second test. However, this simplification assumes conditional independence—that is, that the results of the first test do not affect the likelihood of the second test result—and this is often not true. Finally, many texts assert that sensitivity and specificity are prevalence-independent parameters of test accuracy. This statistically useful assumption, however, is often incorrect. A treadmill exercise test, for example, has a sensitivity of ~30% in a population of patients with one-vessel CAD, whereas its sensitivity in patients with severe three-vessel CAD approaches 80%. Thus, the best estimate of sensitivity \n\n---\n\n#### Decision-Making in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 4 \n\nto use in a particular decision may vary, depending on the severity of disease in the local population. A hospitalized, symptomatic, or referral population typically has a higher prevalence of disease and, in particular, a higher prevalence of more advanced disease than does an outpatient population. Consequently, test sensitivity will likely be higher in hospitalized patients and test specificity higher in outpatients. \n\n#### ■ STATISTICAL PREDICTION MODELS \n\nBayes’ rule, when used as presented above, is useful in studying diagnostic testing concepts, but predictions based on multivariable statistical models can more accurately address these more complex problems by simultaneously accounting for additional relevant patient characteristics. In particular, these models explicitly account for multiple, even possibly overlapping, pieces of patient-specific information and assign a relative weight to each on the basis of its unique independent contribution to the prediction in question. For example, a logistic regression model to predict the probability of CAD ideally considers all the relevant independent factors from the clinical examination and diagnostic testing and their relative importance instead of the limited data that clinicians can manage in their heads or with Bayes’ rule. However, despite this strength, prediction models are usually too complex computationally to use without a calculator or computer. Guideline-driven treatment recommendations based on statistical prediction models available online, e.g., the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk calculator for primary prevention with statins and the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC calculator for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, have generated more widespread usage. When electronic health records (EHRs) will provide sufficient platform support to allow for routine use of predictive models in clinical practice and increase their impact on clinical encounters and outcomes remains uncertain. One reason for limited clinical use is that, to date, only a handful of prediction models have been validated sufficiently (for example, Wells criteria for pulmonary embolism; **Table 4-2** ). The importance of independent validation in a population separate from the one used to develop the model cannot be overstated. An unvalidated prediction model should be viewed with the skepticism appropriate for any new drug or medical device that has not had rigorous clinical trial testing. When statistical survival models in cancer and heart disease have been compared directly with clinicians’ predictions, the survival models have been found to be more consistent, as would be expected, but not always more accurate. On the other hand, comparison of clinicians with websites and apps that generate lists of possible diagnoses to help patients with self-diagnosis found that physicians outperformed the currently available programs. For students and less-experienced clinicians, the biggest value of diagnostic decision support may be in extending diagnostic possibilities and triggering “rational override,” but their impact on knowledge, information-seeking, and problemsolving needs additional research. \n\n## FORMAL DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS \n\n#### ■ DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS \n\n Over the past 50 years, many attempts have been made to develop computer systems to aid clinical decision-making and patient management. Conceptually, computers offer several levels of potentially useful support for clinicians. At the most basic level, they provide ready access to vast reservoirs of information, which may, however, be quite difficult to sort through to find what is needed. At higher levels, computers can support care management decisions by making accurate predictions of outcome, or can simulate the whole decision process, and provide algorithmic guidance. Computer-based predictions using Bayesian or statistical regression models inform a clinical decision but do not actually reach a “conclusion” or “recommendation.” Machine learning methods are being applied to pattern recognition tasks such as the examination of skin lesions and the interpretation of x-rays. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems attempt to simulate or replace human reasoning with a computer-based analogue. Natural language processing allows the system to access and process large amounts of data, both from the EHR and from the medical literature. To date, such approaches have achieved only limited success. The most prominent example, IBM’s Watson program, introduced publicly in 2011, has yet to produce persuasive evidence of clinical decision support utility. Reminder or protocol-directed systems do not make predictions but use existing algorithms, such as guidelines or appropriate utilization criteria, to direct clinical practice. In general, however, decision support systems have so far had little impact on practice. Reminder systems built into EHRs have shown the most promise, particularly in correcting drug dosing and promoting adherence to guidelines. Checklists may also help avoid or reduce errors. \n\n#### ■ DECISION ANALYSIS \n\n Compared with the decision support methods discussed earlier, decision analysis represents a normative prescriptive approach to decision-making in the face of uncertainty. Its principal application is in complex decisions. For example, public health policy decisions often involve trade-offs in length versus quality of life, benefits versus resource use, population versus individual health, and uncertainty regarding efficacy, effectiveness, and adverse events as well as values or preferences regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes. One recent analysis using this approach involved the optimal screening strategy for breast cancer, which has remained controversial, in part because a randomized controlled trial to determine when to begin screening and how often to repeat screening mammography is impractical. In 2016, the National Cancer Institute–sponsored Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) examined eight strategies differing by whether to initiate mammography screening at age 40, 45, or 50 years and whether to screen annually, biennially, or annually for women in their forties and biennially thereafter (hybrid). The six simulation models found biennial strategies to be the most efficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening for 1000 women from age 50–74 years versus no screening avoided seven breast cancer deaths. Screening annually from age 40–74 years avoided three additional deaths but required 20,000 additional mammograms and yielded 1988 more false-positive results. Factors that influenced the results included patients with a 2–4-fold higher risk for developing breast cancer in whom annual screening from age 40–74 years yielded similar benefits as biennial screening from age 50–74. For average-risk patients with moderate or severe comorbidities, screening could be stopped earlier, at age 66–68 years. This analysis involved six models that reproduced epidemiologic trends and a screening trial result, accounted for digital technology and treatments advances, and considered quality of life, risk factors, breast density, and comorbidity. It provided novel insights into a public health problem in the absence of a randomized clinical trial and helped weigh the pros and cons of such a health policy recommendation. Although such models have been developed for selected clinical problems, their benefit and application to individual real-time clinical management has yet to be demonstrated. \n\n TABLE 4-2 Wells Clinical Prediction Rule for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) CLINICAL FEATURE POINTS Clinical signs of deep-vein thrombosis 3 Alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE 3 Heart rate \u003e100 beats/min 1.5 Immobilization ≥3 days or surgery in previous 4 weeks \n\n 1.5 \n\n History of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism \n\n 1.5 \n\n Hemoptysis 1 Malignancy (with treatment within 6 months) or palliative \n\n 1 \n\n INTERPRETATION Score \u003e6.0 High Score 2.0–6.0 Intermediate Score \u003c2.0 Low \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n## DIAGNOSIS AS AN ELEMENT OF QUALITY \n\n## OF CARE \n\n High-quality medical care begins with accurate diagnosis. The incidence of diagnostic errors has been estimated by a variety of methods including postmortem examinations, medical record reviews, and medical malpractice claims, with each yielding complementary but different estimates of this quality of care patient-safety problem. In the past, diagnostic errors tended to be viewed as a failure of individual clinicians. The modern view is that they are mostly a system of care deficiencies. Current estimates suggest that nearly everyone will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, leading to mortality, morbidity, unnecessary tests and procedures, costs, and anxiety. Solutions to the “diagnostic errors as a system of care” problem have focused on system-level approaches, such as decision support and other tools integrated into EHRs. The use of checklists has been proposed as a means of reducing some of the cognitive errors discussed earlier in the chapter, such as premature closure. While checklists have been shown to be useful in certain medical contexts, such as operating rooms and intensive care units, their value in preventing diagnostic errors that lead to patient adverse events remains to be shown. \n\n## EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE \n\n Clinical medicine is defined traditionally as a practice combining medical knowledge (including scientific evidence), intuition, and judgment in the care of patients (Chap. 1). Evidence-based medicine (EBM) updates this construct by placing much greater emphasis on the processes by which clinicians gain knowledge of the most up-to-date and relevant clinical research to determine for themselves whether medical interventions alter the disease course and improve the length or quality of life. The phrase “evidence-based medicine” is now used so often and in so many different contexts that many practitioners are unaware of its original meaning. The intention of the EBM program, as described in the early 1990s by its founding proponents at McMaster University, becomes clearer through an examination of its four key steps: \n\n1. Formulating the management question to be answered \n\n2. Searching the literature and online databases for applicable research     data \n\n3. Appraising the evidence gathered with regard to its validity and     relevance \n\n4. Integrating this appraisal with knowledge about the unique aspects     of the patient (including the patient’s preferences about the possible     outcomes)     The process of searching the world’s research literature and apprais- ing the quality and relevance of studies can be time-consuming and requires skills and training that most clinicians do not possess. In a busy clinical practice, the work required is also logistically not feasible. This has led to a focus on finding recent systematic overviews of the problem in question as a useful shortcut in the EBM process. System- atic reviews are regarded by some as the highest level of evidence in the EBM hierarchy because they are intended to comprehensively summa- rize the available evidence on a particular topic. To avoid the potential biases found in narrative review articles, predefined reproducible explicit search strategies and inclusion and exclusion criteria seek to find all of the relevant scientific research and grade its quality. The pro- totype for this kind of resource is the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. When appropriate, a meta-analysis is used to quantitatively summarize the systematic review findings (discussed further below).     Unfortunately, systematic reviews are not uniformly the acme of the EBM process they were initially envisioned to be. In select cir- cumstances, they can provide a much clearer picture of the state of the evidence than is available from any individual clinical report, but their value is less clear when only a few trials are available, when trials and observational studies are mixed, or when the evidence base is only observational. They cannot compensate for deficiencies in the under- lying research available, and many are created without the requisite clinical insights. The medical literature is now flooded with systematic \n\n reviews of varying quality and clinical utility. The peer review system has, unfortunately, not proved to be an effective arbiter of quality of these papers. Therefore, systematic reviews should be used with circumspection in conjunction with selective reading of some of the best empirical studies. \n\n#### ■ SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: CLINICAL TRIALS AND \n\n#### REGISTRIES \n\n The notion of learning from observation of patients is as old as medicine itself. Over the past 50 years, physicians’ understanding of how best to turn raw observation into useful evidence has evolved considerably. Medicine has received a hard refresher lesson in this process from COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in the spring of 2020, case reports, personal and institutional anecdotal experience, and small singlecenter case series started appearing in the peer-reviewed literature and within months turned into a flood of confusing and often contradictory evidence. Observational reports of treatments for COVID-19 fueled the confusion. Despite \u003e40,000 publications appearing in the first 7 months of the pandemic, an enormous amount of uncertainty around prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease remained. Many of the early 2020 publications were either small observational series or reviews of published series, neither of which can resolve the key uncertainties clinicians need to address in caring for these patients. These small observational studies often have substantial limitations in validity and generalizability, and although they may generate important hypotheses or be the first reports of adverse events or therapeutic benefit, they have no role in formulating modern standards of practice. The major tools used to develop reliable evidence consist of randomized clinical trials supplemented strategically by large (high-quality) observational registries. A registry or database typically is focused on a disease or syndrome (e.g., different types of cancer, acute or chronic CAD, pacemaker capture, or chronic heart failure), a clinical procedure (e.g., bone marrow transplantation, coronary revascularization), or an administrative process (e.g., claims data used for billing and reimbursement). By definition, in observational data, the investigator does not control patient care. Carefully collected prospective observational data, however, can at times achieve a level of evidence quality approaching that of major clinical trial data. At the other end of the spectrum, data collected retrospectively (e.g., chart review) are limited in form and content to what previous observers recorded and may not include the specific research data being sought (e.g., claims data). Advantages of observational data include the inclusion of a broader population as encountered in practice than is typically represented in clinical trials because of their restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, observational data provide primary evidence for research questions when a randomized trial cannot be performed. For example, it would be difficult to randomize patients to test diagnostic or therapeutic strategies that are unproven but widely accepted in practice, and it would be unethical to randomize based on sex, racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status, or country of residence or to randomize patients to a potentially harmful intervention, such as smoking or deliberately overeating to develop obesity. A well-done prospective observational study of a particular management strategy differs from a well-done randomized clinical trial most importantly by its lack of protection from treatment selection bias. The use of observational data to compare diagnostic or therapeutic strategies assumes that sufficient uncertainty and heterogeneity exists in clinical practice to ensure that similar patients will be managed differently by diverse physicians. In short, the analysis assumes that a sufficient element of randomness (in the sense of disorder rather than in the formal statistical sense) exists in clinical management. In such cases, statistical models attempt to adjust for important imbalances to “level the playing field” so that a fair comparison among treatment options can be made. When management is clearly not random (e.g., all eligible left main CAD patients are referred for coronary bypass surgery), the problem may be too confounded (biased) for statistical correction, and observational data may not provide reliable evidence. \n\n---\n\n#### Decision-Making in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 4 \n\nIn general, the use of concurrent controls is vastly preferable to that of historical controls. For example, comparison of current surgical management of left main CAD with medically treated patients with left main CAD during the 1970s (the last time these patients were routinely treated with medicine alone) would be extremely misleading because “medical therapy” has substantially improved in the interim. Randomized controlled clinical trials include the careful prospective design features of the best observational data studies but also include the use of random allocation of treatment. This design provides the best protection against measured and unmeasured confounding due to treatment selection bias (a major aspect of internal validity). However, the randomized trial may not have good external validity (generalizability) if the process of recruitment into the trial resulted in the exclusion of many potentially eligible subjects or if the nominal eligibility for the trial describes a very heterogeneous population. Consumers of medical evidence need to be aware that randomized trials vary widely in their quality and applicability to practice. The process of designing such a trial often involves many compromises. For example, trials designed to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an investigational drug or device must fulfill regulatory requirements (such as the use of a placebo control) that may result in a trial population and design that differ substantially from what practicing clinicians would find most useful. \n\n#### ■ META-ANALYSIS \n\nThe Greek prefix meta signifies something at a later or higher stage of development. Meta-analysis is research that combines and summarizes the available evidence quantitatively. Although it is used to examine nonrandomized studies, meta-analysis is most useful for summarizing all available randomized trials examining a particular therapy used in a specific clinical context. Ideally, unpublished trials should be identified and included to avoid publication bias (i.e., missing “negative” trials that may not be published). Furthermore, the best meta-analyses obtain and analyze individual patient-level data from all trials rather than using only the summary data from published reports. Nonetheless, not all published meta-analyses yield reliable evidence for a particular problem, so their methodology should be scrutinized carefully to ensure proper study design and analysis. The results of a well-done meta-analysis are likely to be most persuasive if they include at least several large-scale, properly performed randomized trials. Metaanalysis can especially help detect benefits when individual trials are inadequately powered (e.g., the benefits of streptokinase thrombolytic therapy in acute MI demonstrated by ISIS-2 in 1988 were evident by the early 1970s through meta-analysis). However, in cases in which the available trials are small or poorly done, meta-analysis should not be viewed as a remedy for deficiencies in primary trial data or trial design. Meta-analyses typically focus on summary measures of relative treatment benefit, such as odds ratios or relative risks. Clinicians should also examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be expected from the therapy. A metric of absolute treatment benefit that is frequently reported is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse outcome event (e.g., death, stroke). NNT should not be interpreted literally as a causal statement. NNT is simply 1/ARR. For example, if a hypothetical therapy reduced mortality rates over a 5-year follow-up by 33% (the relative treatment benefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% (treatment arm), the ARR would be 12% – 8% = 4% and the NNT would be 1/.04, or 25. This does not mean literally that 1 patient benefits and 24 do not. However, it can be conceptualized as an informal measure of treatment efficiency. If the hypothetical treatment was applied to a lower-risk population, say, with a 6% 5-year mortality, the 33% relative treatment benefit would reduce absolute mortality by 2% (from 6% to 4%), and the NNT for the same therapy in this lower-risk group of patients would be 50. Although not always made explicit, comparisons of NNT estimates from different studies should account for the duration of follow-up used to create each estimate. In addition, the NNT concept assumes a homogeneity in response to treatment that may not be accurate. The NNT is simply another way of summarizing the absolute treatment difference and does not provide any unique information. \n\n#### ■ CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \n\n Per the 1990 Institute of Medicine definition, clinical practice guidelines are “systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances.” This definition emphasizes several crucial features of modern guideline development. First, guidelines are created by using the tools of EBM. In particular, the core of the development process is a systematic literature search followed by a review of the relevant peerreviewed literature. Second, guidelines usually are focused on a clinical disorder (e.g., diabetes mellitus, stable angina pectoris) or a health care intervention (e.g., cancer screening). Third, the primary objective of guidelines is to improve the quality of medical care by identifying care practices that should be routinely implemented, based on high-quality evidence and high benefit-to-harm ratios for the interventions. Guidelines are intended to “assist” decision-making, not to define explicitly what decisions should be made in a particular situation, in part because guideline-level evidence alone is never sufficient for clinical decisionmaking (e.g., deciding whether to intubate and administer antibiotics for pneumonia in a terminally ill individual, in an individual with dementia, or in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old mother). Guidelines are narrative documents constructed by expert panels whose composition often is determined by interested professional organizations. These panels vary in expertise and in the degree to which they represent all relevant stakeholders. The guideline documents consist of a series of specific management recommendations, a summary indication of the quantity and quality of evidence supporting each recommendation, an assessment of the benefit-to-harm ratio for the recommendation, and a narrative discussion of the recommendations. Many recommendations simply reflect the expert consensus of the guideline panel because literature-based evidence is insufficient or absent. A recent examination of this issue in cardiovascular guidelines showed that \u003c15% of guideline recommendations were based on the highest level of clinical trial evidence, and this proportion had not improved in 10 years despite a substantial number of trials being conducted and published. The final step in guideline construction is peer review, followed by a final revision in response to the critiques provided. Guidelines are closely tied to the process of quality improvement in medicine through their identification of evidence-based best practices. Such practices can be used as quality indicators. Examples include the proportion of acute MI patients who receive aspirin upon admission to a hospital and the proportion of heart failure patients with a depressed ejection fraction treated with an ACE inhibitor. \n\n## CONCLUSIONS \n\n Thirty years after the introduction of the EBM movement, it is tempting to think that all the difficult decisions practitioners face have been or soon will be solved and digested into practice guidelines and computerized reminders. However, EBM provides practitioners with an ideal rather than a finished set of tools with which to manage patients. Moreover, even with such evidence, it is always worth remembering that the response to therapy of the “average” patient represented by the summary clinical trial outcomes may not be what can be expected for the specific patient sitting in front of a provider in the clinic or hospital. In addition, meta-analyses cannot generate evidence when there are no adequate randomized trials, and most of what clinicians confront in practice will never be thoroughly tested in a randomized trial. For the foreseeable future, excellent clinical reasoning skills and experience supplemented by well-designed quantitative tools and a keen appreciation for the role of individual patient preferences in their health care will continue to be of paramount importance in the practice of clinical medicine. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Croskerry P: A universal model of diagnostic reasoning.

As the correlation between clinical signs and symptoms with pathoanatomy required autopsy material, diseases tended to be characterized by the end organ in which the primary syndrome was manifest and by late-stage presentations. Morgagni institutionalized this framework with the publication of De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomen Indagatis in 1761, in which he correlated the clinical features of patients with more than 600 autopsies at the University of Padua, demonstrating an anatomic basis for disease pathophysiology. Clinicopathologic observation served as the basis for inductive generalization coupled with the application of Occam’s razor in which disease complexity was reduced to its simplest possible form. While this approach to defining human disease has held sway for over a century and facilitated the conquest of many diseases previously considered incurable, overly inclusive and simplified Oslerian diagnostics suffer from significant shortcomings. These include, but are not limited to, failure to distinguish the underlying etiology of different diseases with common pathophenotypes. For example, many different diseases can cause end-stage kidney disease or heart failure. Over time, the classification of neurodegenerative disorders or lymphomas, as well as many other diseases, is becoming more refined and precise as the underlying etiologies are identified. These distinctions are important for providing predictable prognostic information for individual patients with even highly prevalent diseases. Additionally, therapies may be ineffective owing to a lack of understanding of the often subtle molecular complexities of specific disease drivers. \n\n# 5 \n\n## Precision Medicine and \n\n## Clinical Care \n\n The Editors \n\n Fanaroff AC et al: Levels of evidence supporting American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology Guidelines, 2008-2018.

Diagnosis (Berl) 7:191, 2020. \n\n Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, the era of molecular medicine offered the idealized possibility of identifying the underlying molecular basis of every disease. Using a conventional reductionist paradigm, physician-scientists explored disease mechanism at everincreasing molecular depth, seeking the single (or limited number of ) molecular cause(s) of many human diseases. Yet, as effective as this now conventional scientific approach was at uncovering many disease mechanisms, the clinical manifestations of very few diseases could be explained on the basis of a single molecular mechanism. Even knowledge of the globin β chain mutation that causes sickle cell disease does not predict the many different manifestations of the disease (stroke syndrome, painful crises, and hemolytic crisis, among others). Clearly, the profession had expected too much from oversimplified reductionism and failed to take into consideration the extraordinary biologic variety and its accompanying molecular and genetic complexity that underpin both normal and pathologic diversity. The promise of the Human Genome Project provided new tools and approaches and unleashed efforts to identify a monogenic, oligogenic, or polygenic cause for every disease (allowing for environmental modulation). Yet, once again, disappointment reigned as the pool of genomes expanded without the expected revelations (aside from rare variants). The arc of progressive reductionism (as illustrated for tuberculosis in Fig. 5-1 ) in refining and explaining disease reached a humbling plateau, revealing the need for new approaches to understand better the etiology, manifestations, and progression of most diseases. The stage was set for a return to holism. However, in contrast to the holism of ancient physicians, we adopted one that is integrative, taking genomic context into account in all dimensions. In the course of elaborating this complex pathobiologic landscape, disease definition must become more precise and progressively more individualized, setting the stage for what we term precision medicine. Oversimplification of phenotype is a natural outgrowth of the observational scientific method. Categorizing individuals as falling into groups or clusters that are reasonably similar simplifies the task of the diagnostician and also facilitates the application of “specific” therapies more broadly. Biomedicine has been viewed as less quantitative and precise than other scientific disciplines, with biologic and pathobiologic diversity (biologic “noise”) viewed as the norm. Thus, distilling such observational complexity to a fundamental group of symptoms or signs that are reasonably invariant across a group of sick individuals has served as the basis for the approach to disease and its treatment since the earliest days of medicine. This approach to diagnosis and therapy has remained in place into the twenty-first century, serving as the basis for the development of standard diagnostic tests and of broadly applied drug therapies. Targeting larger groups of patients is efficient when applied to large populations. As successful as this approach has been in advancing medical care, it is important to point out its limitations, which include significant predictive inaccuracies and sizeable segments of the disease population who do not respond to the most “effective” drugs (upward of 60% by some estimates). Clearly, a more nuanced approach to diagnosis and therapy is required to achieve better prognostic and therapeutic outcomes. Turning first to phenotype, astute clinicians know full well the subtle and vivid differences in presentation that are often manifest among individuals with the same disease. In some cases, these differences in pathophenotype lead to new subclassifications of the disease, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction versus heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Often, these relatively crude efforts at making diagnoses more precise are driven by new technologies or new ways of applying established technologies. In other cases, differences in pathophenotype are more subtle, not necessarily clinically apparent, and often driven by measures of endophenotype, such as distinctions among vasculitides facilitated by refinements in serologies or immunophenotyping. The impetus to create these subclasses of disease is largely determined by the need to improve prognosis and apply more precise and effective therapies. Based on these guiding principles, many experienced clinicians will argue—and rightly so—that they have been practicing personalized, precision medicine throughout their careers: they characterize each patient’s illness in great detail, and choose therapies that respect and are guided by those individualized clinical and laboratory features, limited though they may be. \n\n---\n\n#### Precision Medicine and Clinical Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 5 \n\nFor many diseases, genomic variation, whether inherited or acquired, provides opportunities to refine diagnostic precision with even greater fidelity and predictive accuracy. For this reason, the field of precision medicine has now entered a new era that couples the molecular reductionism of the last century with an integrative, systems-level understanding of the basis for pathophenotype. Equally important, modern genomics has established that genomic context, sometimes referred to as modifier genes, is distinctive for each individual person; hence, understanding that context provides the insight necessary to predict how a primary disease driver or drivers may manifest a clinical pathophenotype—e.g., why some individuals with sickle cell anemia will develop stroke, while others will develop acute chest syndrome. This concept that primary genetic and/or environmental drivers of a disease differentially affect disease expression based on an individual’s unique genomic context serves as the ultimate basis for much of what we denote as precision medicine. To develop a precision medicine strategy for any disease, the clinician needs to be aware of two important, confounding principles. First, patients with different diseases can manifest similar pathophenotypes, i.e., convergent phenotypes. Examples of this principle include the hypertrophied myocardium found in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, critical aortic stenosis, and untreated, long-standing hypertension; and the thrombotic microangiopathy found in malignant hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, eclampsia, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Second, patients with the same basic disease can manifest very different pathophenotypes, i.e., divergent phenotypes **(Chap. 466)**. Examples of this principle include the different clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease and the incomplete penetrance of \n\n many common genetic diseases. These common presentations of different diseases and different presentations of the same disease are both a consequence of genomic context coupled with unique exposures over an individual’s lifetime (Fig. 5-2). Understanding the interplay among these many complex molecular determinants of disease expression is essential for the success of precision medicine. Given the complexity of the genomic and environmental context of an individual, one must ask the question: How precise do we need to be in order to practice effective precision medicine? Complete knowledge of a person’s comprehensive genome (DNA, gene expression, mitochondrial function, proteome, metabolome, posttranslational modification of the proteome, and metagenome, among others) and quantitative assessments of environmental and social history are not possible to acquire; yet, this shortcoming does not render the general problem intractable. Owing to the fact that the molecular networks that govern phenotype are overdetermined (i.e., redundant) and that there are primary drivers of disease expression that are modified in a weighted way by other genomic features of an individual, the practice of precision medicine can be realized without complete knowledge of all dimensions of the genome. Examples of how best to realize this strategy are discussed later in this chapter. \n\n#### ■ REQUIREMENTS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE \n\n The essential elements of any precision medicine effort include phenotyping, endophenotyping (defining the characteristics of a disorder that are not readily observable), and genomic profiling (Fig. 5-3). While subtle distinctions among individuals with the same disease are well known to clinicians, formalizing these nuanced differences is critical for achieving more precise phenotypes.

Biochemical, immunologic, and molecular tests of body fluids provide additional detail to the overall phenotype. Importantly, these objective laboratory tests together with functional studies compose an assessment of the endophenotype (or endotype) of an individual, refining the overall discriminant power of the evaluation. One additional concept that has gained traction in recent years is the notion of orthogonal phenotyping, i.e., assessing clinical, molecular, imaging, or functional (endo)phenotypes seemingly unrelated to the clinical presentation. These features further enhance the ability to distinguish (sub) phenotypes and derive from the fact that diseases can be subtly (subclinically) manifest in organ systems different from that in which the primary symptoms or signs are expressed. While some diseases are well known to affect multiple organ systems (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus) and in many cases involvement of those many systems is assessed at initial diagnosis, such is not the case for most other diseases. As we begin to understand the differences in the organ-specific expression of genomic variants that drive or modify disease, it is becoming increasingly apparent that orthogonal—or more appropriately, unbiased comprehensive—phenotyping should become the norm. Genomic profiling must next be coupled to detailed phenotyping. The complex levels of genomic assessment continue to mature and include DNA sequencing (exomic, whole genome), gene expression (mRNA and protein expression), and metabolomics. In addition, the epigenome, the posttranslationally modified proteome, and the metagenome (the personal microbiome of an individual) are gaining traction as additional elements of comprehensive genomics (Chap. 483). Not all of these genomic features are yet available for clinical laboratory testing, and those that are available are largely confined to blood testing. While DNA sequencing using whole blood would generally apply to any organ-based disease, \n\n---\n\n#### Precision Medicine and Clinical Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 5 \n\ngene expression, metabolomics, and epigenetics are often tissue specific. As tissue specimens cannot always or easily be obtained from the organ of interest, attempts at correlating whole-blood mRNA, protein, or metabolite profiles with those of the involved organ are critical for precise prognostics and therapeutic choices. In many cases, systemic consequences to an organ-specific disease (e.g., systemic inflammatory responses in individuals with atherosclerosis) can be ascertained and may provide useful prognostic information or therapeutic strategies. These biomarker signatures are the subject of ongoing discovery and have provided useful guidance toward improved diagnostic precision in many diseases. However, in many diseases, the correlations between these plasma or blood markers and organ-based diseases are weak, indicating a need to analyze each condition and each resulting signature before applying it to clinical decision-making. It is important to note that one of the key determinants of the functional consequences of a genetic variant believed to drive a disease phenotype is not simply its expression in a tissue of interest but, more importantly, the coexpression of protein binding partners in that same tissue comprising specific (dys)functional pathways that govern phenotype **(Fig. 5-4)**. An alternative strategy currently under investigation is the conversion of induced pluripotent stem cells from a patient into a cell type of interest for gene expression or metabolomics study. As rational as this approach seems from first principles, it is important to note that gene expression patterns in these induced, differentiated cell types are not completely consonant with their native counterparts, offering often limited additional information at potentially great additional expense. While phenotype features of many chronic diseases are assessed over time, genomic features tend to be limited to single time point sampling. Time trajectories are extremely informative in precision genotyping and phenotyping, with gene expression patterns and phenotypes changing over time in different ways among different patients with the same overarching phenotype. Cost, feasible sampling frequency, predictive power, and therapeutic choices will all drive the optimal strategy for the acquisition of timed samples in any given patient; however, with continued cost reduction in genomics technologies, this limitation may be progressively mitigated and clinical application may become a reality. One important class of diseases that does not have most of these limitations in genomic profiling is cancer. Cancers can be (and are) sampled (biopsied) frequently to monitor temporal changes in the somatically mutating oncogenome and its consequences for the limited number of well-defined oncogenic driver pathways **(Chap. 68)**. A unique limitation of cancer in this regard, however, is that the frequency of somatic mutations over time (and, especially, with treatment) is great and the functional consequences of many of these mutations unknown. Equally important, assessment of single-cell mRNA sequencing patterns demonstrates great variability between apparently similar cells, challenging functional interpretation. Lastly, in solid tumors, stromal cells interact in a variety of ways (e.g., metabolically) with the associated malignant cells, and their gene expression signatures are also modified by the changing somatic mutational landscape of the primary malignancy. Thus, while much more information can be obtained over time in most cancer patients, the interpretation of these rich data sets continues to remain largely semi-empirical. The possibility of identifying specific therapeutic targets remains a major goal of precision medicine. Doing so requires more than simple DNA sequencing and must include analysis of some level of gene expression, ideally in the involved organ(s). In addition to demonstrating the expression of a variant protein in the organ, one must ideally also demonstrate its functional consequences, which requires ascertaining the expression of binding partner proteins and the functional pathways they comprise. To achieve this goal, a variety of approaches have been tried, one of the most successful of which is the construction of the protein-protein interactome (the interactome), which is a comprehensive network map of the protein-protein interactions in a cell or organ of interest **(Chap. 486)**. This template provides information on the subnetworks that govern a disease phenotype (disease modules), which can be further individualized by incorporating individual variants and differentially expressed proteins that are patient specific. This type of analysis leads to the creation of an individual “reticulome” or \n\n reticulotype, which links the genotype to the phenotype of an individual (Fig. 5-5). Using this approach, one can identify potential drug targets in a rational way or can even repurpose existing drugs by demonstrating the proximity of a known drug target to a disease module of interest (Fig. 5-6). For example, in multicentric Castleman’s disease, a disorder of unclear etiology, recognition that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is highly activated led to trials with an existing, approved drug, sirolimus. Precision medicine offers additional opportunities for optimizing the utilization of a drug by assessing the individualized pharmacogenomics of its disposition and metabolism, as demonstrated for the adverse consequences of variants in TPMT on azathioprine metabolism and in CYP2C19 on clopidogrel metabolism (Chap. 68). \n\n#### ■ EXAMPLES OF PRECISION MEDICINE \n\n#### APPLICATIONS \n\n The field of precision medicine did not appear abruptly in medical history but, rather, evolved gradually as clinicians became more aware of differences among patients with the same disease. With the advent of modern genomics, in the ideal situation, these phenotype differences can now be mapped to genotype differences. Thus, we can consider precision medicine from the perspective of the pregenomic era and the postgenomic era. Pregenomic precision medicine was applied to many diseases as therapeutic classes expanded for those disorders. A prime example of this approach is in the field of heart failure, where diuretics, digoxin, beta blockers, afterload-reducing agents, venodilators, reninangiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, and brain natriuretic peptide (nesiritide) are commonly used in some combination for most patients. The choice of agents is governed by the evidence basis for their use, but tailored to the primary pathophysiologic phenotypes manifest in a patient, such as congestion, hypertension, and impaired contractility. These treatments were developed in the latter half of the last century based on empiric observation, reductionist experiments of specific pathways believed to be involved in the pathophysiology, and clinical response in prospective trials. As phenotyping became more refined (e.g., echocardiographic assessments of ventricular function and tissue Doppler characterization of ventricular relaxation), the syndrome was subclassified into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the latter of which does not respond well to any of the classes of therapeutic agents currently available. In the postgenomic era, ever more refined and detailed methods are under investigation to characterize pathophenotypes as well as genotypes, which may then be matched to the idealized combination of therapeutic classes of agents. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is another disease for which definitive therapies straddle the preand postgenomic eras of precision medicine. Prior to the 1990s, there were no effective therapies for this highly morbid and lethal condition. With the advent of molecular and biochemical characterization of vascular abnormalities in individuals with established disease, however, therapies with agents that restored normal vascular function improved morbidity and mortality. These included calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin congeners, and endothelin receptor antagonists. As genomic characterization of the disease has progressed over the past two decades, there is increasing recognition of distinct genotypes that yield unique phenotypes (Chap. 283) , such as the demonstration of a primarily fibrotic endophenotype governed by the (oxidized) scaffold protein NEDD-9 and its aldosterone-dependent, TGF-β-independent enhancement of collagen III expression. This approach will continue to evolve as therapies become more effective (e.g., for perivascular fibrosis) and therapeutic choices better targeted to individual patients. Precision genomics has also led to a new classification of the dementias, conditions previously thought to have a single cause with varied clinical expression. These disorders can now be categorized based on the genes and pathways involved and the site where aggregated proteins first form and then spread in the nervous system. For example, the varied clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia, including progressive aphasia, behavioral disturbances, and dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, can now be linked to specific genotypes and susceptible cells (Chap. 432). In prion diseases, the clinical phenotype \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n FIGURE 5-4 Gene expression and phenotype. A. The human protein-protein interactome is constructed, and a specific disease module is identified (I); gene expression within this module is ascertained (II); and the tissue specificity of gene expression is determined (III). This analysis leads to a reduction of the total number of disease module genes that govern phenotype in a specific organ, which is a reflection of the specific pathway (or pathways) that is (or are) expressed in their functional entirety in that tissue.

Similarly, in myasthenia gravis, the identification of novel autoantibodies now permits stratification and a more finely tuned precision approach to therapy **(Chap. 448)**. \n\n Precision medicine approaches to cancers have, of course, become the prime example of the opportunity that this strategy offers. In the pregenomic era, chemotherapy was widely used with variable success despite continued efforts to characterize the molecular features of the specific tumors and their semi-empiric responses to specific chemotherapeutic agents. As cancer genome sequencing evolved, however, it became apparent that there are a limited number of oncogenic pathways (\u003c20) that are represented in the great majority of malignancies, without regard for the organ in which the disease was primarily manifest. These genomic signatures served as a template for precisely targeted therapies that have led to dramatic changes in response to treatment, including, for example, imatinib (and congeners) for Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia, erlotinib for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancers, and ibrutinib for Bruton tyrosine kinase in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, among many others. As exciting as these approaches have been, there are at least three primary challenges associated with precision therapeutics that are unique to cancer: (1) the mutational landscape continues to evolve as the disease progresses, and therapy often (if not invariably) leads to selection for resistant clones; (2) the likelihood that any cancer can be definitively cured by any single agent, no matter its exquisite precision, is quite limited, necessitating \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n Health system data \n\n ‘Omic’ data \n\n Exposome/social determinants \n\n Microbiome \n\n Study-participantgenerated data \n\n Motivations and behaviours \n\n Precision participant descriptor \n\n BC Electronic health-care system of the future \n\n Dynamic phenotype Data curation and user-friendly display \n\n A \n\n FIGURE 5-7 Big data in precision medicine.

Despite these serious shortcomings, the application of progressively more refined and precisely targeted therapies used alone and in combination, such as with immune modulators, continues to offer great promise for the treatment of these diseases. In some ways, these approaches in cancer mirror earlier strategies in the treatment of infectious diseases in which the identification of the causative organism and its sensitivity to potential antimicrobials allows precision approaches to treatment. Combinatorial antimicrobial treatments represent an effective strategy to address acquired resistance. These diagnostic and therapeutic strategies can be applied without detailed knowledge of personalized responses to the infection or treatment (aside from serious adverse effects) with good outcomes in most cases. Yet, individuals do respond differently to specific infections and their treatments, possibly driven by different endophenotypes (e.g., different inflammatory responses), suggesting that more precise knowledge of these precise mechanistic differences may yield improved prognosis and therapeutic approaches. As with cancer, immune modulation, particularly for immune exhaustion in chronic infections, represents a new frontier, again amenable to the personalized, precise analyses described above. \n\n#### ■ THE FUTURE OF PRECISION MEDICINE \n\n Precision medicine clearly holds great promise for the future of the practice of medicine. For precision medicine to continue to evolve successfully, however, several requirements will need to be met. First, both deeply refined personal phenotypic data and genomic data are essential as the information with which precision analysis is performed. These data sets are quite large and require sufficient storage for analysis, especially for individuals in whom time trajectories are acquired (as should be the case for every person). Equally important, the analytical methods required to extract useful information from these data sets are evolving and themselves quite complex. While great progress has been made in genomics and biochemical testing, our ability to capture meaningful immunologic endophenotypes and environmental exposures is limited by comparison. Machine learning and artificial (auxiliary) intelligence methods will be essential for extracting optimal information from these data sets, which include not only pathways that can be uniquely targeted therapeutically but also individualized genomic or phenotypic signatures that are highly predictive of outcome, with or without therapy. Gathering sufficient information on the “normal” segments of the population is also required to ensure appropriate comparison data sets for optimal prediction. Second, phenotyping must continue to expand and become dimensionally richer. The phenotypic features included in this data gathering must incorporate not only data relevant to the clinical presentation but also orthogonal phenotypic data that may yield useful information on disease trajectory or preclinical disease markers. Personal device data, environmental exposure history, social network interactions, and health system data will all be incorporated increasingly in defining phenotype and will require great efforts on the part of the medical informatics community to harmonize data sets, standardize data collection, and optimize/standardize data analysis (Fig. 5-7). Third, perhaps the greatest challenge to making precision medicine the standard approach to illness will be to determine the minimal data set required to predict outcome and response to therapy. Gathering data is comparatively simple; however, analyzing it to eliminate redundant information in these overdetermined biologic systems, weighting the determinants of an outcome, and using the data as phenomic/genomic signatures that are easier to collect than comprehensive, unbiased data sets are the ideal goals—a major challenge, but not insurmountable. Rapidly evolving machine learning and artificial intelligence strategies will also be essential for maximal success. To return to the question of how precise precision medicine needs to be in order to be useful, please refer to Fig. 5-8 where the approaches \n\n---\n\n#### Screening and Prevention of Disease \n\n#### CHAPTER 6 \n\nto clinical trial design meant to improve therapeutic signal are illustrated. Decreasing heterogeneity and enriching the study population will enhance the effect size, but these strategies are based on analyses of prior data sets that define those individuals who are more likely than not to respond to a therapy. By contrast, the notion of predictive enrichment follows from the information provided by a detailed, big data–driven analysis of individuals that explores phenotypic and genomic features used to predict response. These features need not be precisely met by each patient; however, they can be collated or clustered to define a reasonably sized cohort predicted to respond in a particular way within certain confidence bounds. In this way, the boundaries to the practice of precision medicine are imprecise strictly speaking, but sufficiently predictive to be practical from the perspectives of clinical care and cost-effectiveness. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\nAntman EM, Loscalzo J: Precision medicine in cardiology.

Tremendous progress has been made toward this goal over the past 50 years. Screening tests are available for many common diseases and encompass biochemical (e.g., cholesterol, glucose), physiologic (e.g., blood pressure, growth curves), radiologic (e.g., mammogram, bone densitometry), and cytologic (e.g., Pap smear) approaches. Effective preventive interventions have resulted in dramatic declines in mortality from many diseases, particularly infections. Preventive interventions include counseling about risk behaviors, vaccinations, medications, and, in some relatively uncommon settings, surgery. Preventive services (including screening tests, preventive interventions, and counseling) are different than other medical interventions because they are proactively administered to healthy individuals instead of in response to a symptom, sign, or diagnosis. Thus, the decision to recommend a screening test or preventive \n\n# 6 \n\n## Screening and Prevention \n\n## of Disease \n\n Katrina A. Armstrong, Gary J. Martin \n\n intervention requires a particularly high bar of evidence that testing and intervention are both practical and effective. Because population-based screening and prevention strategies must be extremely low risk to have an acceptable benefit-to-harm ratio, the ability to target individuals who are more likely to develop disease could enable the application of a wider set of potential approaches and increase efficiency. Currently, there are many types of data that can predict disease incidence in an asymptomatic individual. Germline genomic data have received the most attention to date, at least in part because mutations in high-penetrance genes have clear implications for preventive care (Chap. 467). Women with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, the two major breast cancer susceptibility genes identified to date, have a markedly increased risk (fiveto twentyfold) of breast and ovarian cancer. Screening and prevention recommendations include prophylactic oophorectomy and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm for women at average cancer risk. Some women with BRCA mutations opt for prophylactic mastectomy to dramatically reduce their breast cancer risk. Although the proportion of common disease explained by high-penetrance genes appears to be relatively small (5–10% of most diseases), mutations in rare, moderate-penetrance genes, and variants in low-penetrance genes, also contribute to the prediction of disease risk. Most recently, polygenic risk scores combining information about variants across hundreds of genes are being evaluated for identifying individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease and other conditions. The advent of affordable whole exome/whole genome sequencing is likely to speed the dissemination of these tests into clinical practice and may transform the delivery of preventive care. Other forms of “omic” data also have the potential to provide important predictive information. Proteomics and metabolomics can provide insight into gene function, but it has proven challenging to develop reliable, predictive measures using these platforms. More recently, it has become possible to measure the presence of mutations in DNA circulating in the bloodstream and in stool, with early promising evidence that these assays can be used to detect cancer before existing screening tests. In addition to “omic” data, imaging data are increasingly being integrated into risk-stratified prevention approaches as evidence grows about the predictive ability of these data. For example, coronary computed tomography (CT) scans are used in many preventive cardiology programs to inform decisions about beginning statin therapy when there is conflicting or uncertain information from other risk assessment approaches. Of course, these data may also be helpful in predicting the risk of harms from screening or prevention, such as the risk of a false-positive mammogram. In addition to advances in risk prediction, there are several other reasons that screening and prevention are likely to gain importance in medical care in the near term. New imaging modalities are being developed that promise to detect changes at the cellular and subcellular levels, greatly increasing the probability that early detection improves outcomes. The rapidly growing understanding of the biologic pathways underlying initiation and progression of many common diseases has the potential to transform the development of preventive interventions, including chemoprevention. Furthermore, screening and prevention offer the promise of both improving health and sparing the costs of disease treatment, an issue that will continue to gain importance as long as health care costs in the United States remain a concern to patients, government agencies, and insurers. This chapter will review the basic principles of screening and prevention in the primary care setting. Recommendations for specific disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are provided in the chapters dedicated to those topics. \n\n#### ■ BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SCREENING \n\n The basic principles of screening populations for disease were published by the World Health Organization in 1968 (Table 6-1). In general, screening is most effective when applied to relatively common disorders that carry a large disease burden (Table 6-2). The five leading causes of mortality in the United States are heart diseases, malignant neoplasms, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n accidents, and cerebrovascular diseases. Thus, many screening strategies are targeted at these conditions. From a global health perspective, these conditions are priorities, but malaria, malnutrition, AIDS, tuberculosis, and violence also carry a heavy disease burden (Chap. 472). Having an effective treatment for early disease has proven challenging for some common diseases. For example, although Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, there are no curative treatments and no evidence that early treatment improves outcomes. Lack of facilities for diagnosis and treatment is a particular challenge for developing countries and may change screening strategies, including the development of “see and treat” approaches such as those currently used for cervical cancer screening in some countries. A long latent or preclinical phase where early treatment increases the chance of cure is a hallmark of many cancers; for example, polypectomy prevents progression to colon cancer. Similarly, early identification of hypertension or hyperlipidemia allows therapeutic interventions that reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. In contrast, lung cancer screening has historically proven more challenging because most tumors are not curable by the time they can be detected on a chest x-ray. However, the length of the preclinical phase also depends on the level of resolution of the screening test, and this situation changed with the development of chest CT. Low-dose chest CT scanning can detect tumors earlier and has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% in individuals who had at least a 30-pack-year history of smoking. The short interval between the ability to detect disease on a screening test and the development of incurable disease also contributes to the limited effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing deaths from some forms of breast cancer. At the other end of the spectrum, the early detection of prostate cancer may not lead to a difference in the mortality rate because the disease is often indolent and competing morbidities, such as coronary artery disease, may ultimately cause mortality (Chap. 70). This uncertainty about the natural history is also reflected in the controversy about treatment of prostate cancer, further contributing to the challenge of screening in this disease. Finally, screening programs can incur significant economic costs that must be considered in the context of the available resources and alternative strategies for improving health outcomes. \n\n#### ■ METHODS OF MEASURING HEALTH BENEFITS \n\n Because screening and preventive interventions are recommended to asymptomatic individuals, they are held to a high standard for demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio before implementation. In general, the principles of evidence-based medicine apply to demonstrating the efficacy of screening tests and preventive interventions, where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality outcomes are the gold standard. However, because RCTs are often not feasible, \n\n TABLE 6-1 Principles of Screening The condition should be an important health problem. There should be a treatment for the condition. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment should be available. There should be a latent stage of the disease. There should be a test or examination for the condition. The test should be acceptable to the population. The natural history of the disease should be adequately understood. There should be an agreed policy on whom to treat. The cost of finding a case should be balanced in relation to overall medical expenditure. \n\n TABLE 6-2 Lifetime Cumulative Risk Breast cancer for women 10% Colon cancer 6% Cervical cancer for womena 2% Domestic violence for women Up to 15% Hip fracture for white women 16% aAssuming an unscreened population. \n\n TABLE 6-3 Estimated Average Increase in Life Expectancy for a Population SCREENING OR PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION AVERAGE INCREASE Mammography: Women, 40–50 years 0–5 days Women, 50–70 years 1 month Pap smears, age 18–65 2–3 months Getting a 35-year-old smoker to quit 3–5 years Beginning regular exercise for a 40-year-old man (30 min, 3 times a week) \n\n 9 months–2 years \n\n observational studies, such as case-control designs, have been used to assess the effectiveness of some interventions such as colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. For some strategies, such as Pap smear screening for cervical cancer, the only data available are ecologic data demonstrating dramatic declines in mortality. Irrespective of the study design used to assess the effectiveness of screening, it is critical that disease incidence or mortality is the primary endpoint rather than length of disease survival. This is important because lead time bias and length time bias can create the appearance of an improvement in disease survival from a screening test when there is no actual effect. Lead time bias occurs because screening identifies a case before it would have presented clinically, thereby creating the perception that a patient lived longer after diagnosis simply by moving the date of diagnosis earlier rather than the date of death later. Length time bias occurs because screening is more likely to identify slowly progressive disease than rapidly progressive disease. Thus, within a fixed period of time, a screened population will have a greater proportion of these slowly progressive cases and will appear to have better disease survival than an unscreened population. A variety of endpoints are used to assess the potential gain from screening and preventive interventions. \n\n1. The absolute and relative impact of screening on disease incidence or     mortality. The absolute difference in disease incidence or mortality     between a screened and nonscreened group allows the comparison     of size of the benefit across preventive services. A meta-analysis     of Swedish mammography trials (ages 40–70) found that ~1.2     fewer women per 1000 would die from breast cancer if they were     screened over a 12-year period. By comparison, at least ~3 lives     per 1000 would be saved from colon cancer in a population (aged     50–75) screened with annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) over     a 13-year period, and an estimated 20–24 lives per 1000 would be     saved over the entire 25-year period. Based on this analysis, colon     cancer screening may actually save more women’s lives than does     mammography. However, the relative impact of FOBT (30% reduc-     tion in colon cancer death) is similar to the relative impact of mam-     mography (14–32% reduction in breast cancer death), emphasizing     the importance of both relative and absolute comparisons. \n\n2. The number of subjects screened to prevent disease or death in one     individual. The inverse of the absolute difference in mortality is     the number of subjects who would need to be screened or receive     a preventive intervention to prevent one death. For example, 731     women aged 65–69 would need to be screened by dual-energy x-ray     absorptiometry (DEXA) (and treated appropriately) to prevent one     hip fracture from osteoporosis. \n\n3. Increase in average life expectancy for a population. Predicted     increases in life expectancy for various screening and preventive     interventions are listed in **Table 6-3**. It should be noted, however, that     the increase in life expectancy is an average that applies to a popula-        tion, not to an individual. In reality, the vast majority of the popula-        tion does not derive any benefit from a screening test. A small subset        of patients, however, will benefit greatly. For example, Pap smears do        not benefit the 98% of women who never develop cancer of the cer-        vix. However, for the 2% who would have developed cervical cancer,        Pap smears may add as much as 25 years to their lives. Some studies        suggest that a 1-month gain of life expectancy is a reasonable goal for        a population-based screening or prevention strategy. \n\n---\n\n#### Screening and Prevention of Disease \n\n#### CHAPTER 6 \n\n#### ■ ASSESSING THE HARMS OF SCREENING \n\n#### AND PREVENTION \n\nJust as with most aspects of medical care, screening and preventive interventions also incur the possibility of adverse outcomes. These adverse outcomes include side effects from preventive medications and vaccinations, false-positive screening tests, overdiagnosis of disease from screening tests, anxiety, radiation exposure from some screening tests, and discomfort from some interventions and screening tests. The risk of side effects from preventive medications is analogous to the use of medications in therapeutic settings and is considered in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. Side effects from currently recommended vaccinations are primarily limited to discomfort and minor immune reactions. However, the concern about associations between vaccinations and serious adverse outcomes continues to limit the acceptance of many vaccinations despite the lack of data supporting the causal nature of these associations. The possibility of a false-positive test occurs with nearly all screening tests, although the definition of what constitutes a false-positive result often varies across settings. For some tests such as screening mammography and screening chest CT, a false-positive result occurs when an abnormality is identified that is not malignant, requiring either a biopsy diagnosis or short-term follow-up. For other tests such as Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the test identifies a wide range of potentially premalignant states, only a small percentage of which would ever progress to an invasive cancer. This risk is closely tied to the risk of overdiagnosis in which the screening test identifies disease that would not have presented clinically in the patient’s lifetime. Assessing the degree of overdiagnosis from a screening test is very difficult given the need for long-term follow-up of an unscreened population to determine the true incidence of disease over time. Recent estimates suggest that as much as 15–40% of breast cancers identified \n\n by mammography screening and 15–37% of prostate cancers identified by prostate-specific antigen testing may never have presented clinically. Screening tests also have the potential to create unwarranted anxiety, particularly in conjunction with false-positive findings. Although multiple studies have documented increased anxiety through the screening process, there are few data suggesting this anxiety has longterm adverse consequences, including subsequent screening behavior. Screening tests that involve radiation (e.g., mammography, chest CT) add to the cumulative radiation exposure for the screened individual. The absolute amount of radiation is very small from any of these tests, but the overall impact of repeated exposure from multiple sources is still being determined. Some preventive interventions (e.g., vaccinations) and screening tests (e.g., mammography) may lead to discomfort at the time of administration, but again, there is little evidence of longterm adverse consequences. \n\n#### ■ WEIGHING THE BENEFITS AND HARMS \n\n The decision to implement a population-based screening and prevention strategy requires weighing the benefits and harms, including the economic impact of the strategy. The costs include not only the expense of the intervention but also time away from work, downstream costs from false-positive results, “incidentalomas” or adverse events, and other potential harms. Cost-effectiveness is typically assessed by calculating the cost per year of life saved, with adjustment for the quality of life impact of different interventions and disease states (i.e., quality-adjusted life-year). Typically, strategies that cost $50,000–100,000 per qualityadjusted year of life saved are considered “cost-effective” (Chap. 4). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of experts in preventive care that provides evidence-based recommendations for screening and preventive strategies based on an assessment of the benefit-to-harm ratio (Tables 6-4 and 6-5). Because \n\n TABLE 6-4 Screening Tests Recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for Average-Risk Adults DISEASE TEST POPULATION FREQUENCY CHAPTER Abdominal aortic aneurysm Ultrasound Men 65–75 who have ever smoked Once Alcohol misuse Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test All adults Unknown 453 Breast cancer Mammography with or without clinical breast examination \n\n Women 50–75 Every 2 years \n\n Cervical cancer Pap smear Women 21–65 Every 3 years 70 Pap smear and/or HPV testing Women 30–65 Every 5 years if HPV negative Chlamydia/gonorrhea Nucleic acid amplification test on urine or cervical swab \n\n Sexually active women \u003c25 Unknown 189 \n\n Colorectal cancer Fecal occult blood testing 45–75 Every year 70, 81 Fecal immunochemical-DNA 45–75 Every 1–3 years Sigmoidoscopy 45–75 Every 5 years Colonoscopy (or occult blood testing combined with sigmoidoscopy) \n\n 45–75 Every 10 years \n\n Depression Screening questions All adults Periodically Diabetes Fasting blood glucose or HgbA1c Adults overweight, obese, or with hypertension \n\n Every 3 years 403 \n\n Hepatitis C Anti-HCV antibody followed by confirmatory PCR \n\n 18–79 Once \n\n HIV Reactive immunoassay or rapid HIV followed by confirmatory test \n\n 15–65 At least once \n\n Hyperlipidemia Cholesterol 40–75 Unknown 407 Hypertension Blood pressure All adults Periodically 277 Intimate partner violence Screening questions Women of childbearing age Unknown Lung cancer Low-dose computed tomography Adults 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years \n\n Yearly \n\n Obesity Body mass index All adults Unknown Osteoporosis DEXA Women \u003e65 or \u003e60 with risk factors Unknown 411 \n\nAbbreviations: DEXA, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HPV, human papillomavirus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

For example, all advisory groups support screening for hyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer, whereas consensus is lower for breast cancer screening among women in their forties and for prostate cancer screening. Because the guidelines are only updated periodically, differences across advisory organizations may also reflect the data that were available when the guideline was issued. For many screening tests and preventive interventions, the balance of benefits and harms may be uncertain for the average-risk population but more favorable for individuals at higher risk for disease. Although age is the most commonly used risk factor for determining screening and prevention recommendations, the USPSTF also recommends some screening tests in populations based upon the presence of other risk factors for the disease. In addition, being at increased risk for the disease often supports initiating screening at an earlier age than that recommended for the average-risk population. For example, when there is a significant family history of colon cancer, it is prudent to initiate screening 10 years before the age at which the youngest family member was diagnosed with cancer. Although informed consent is important for all aspects of medical care, shared decision-making may be a particularly important approach to decisions about preventive services when the benefit-to-harm ratio is uncertain for a specific population. For example, many expert groups, including the American Cancer Society, recommend an individualized discussion about prostate cancer screening, because the decisionmaking process is complex and relies heavily on personal issues. Some men may decline screening, whereas others may be more willing to accept the risks of an early detection strategy. Recent analysis suggests that many men may be better off not screening for prostate cancer because watchful waiting was the preferred strategy when qualityadjusted life-years were considered. Another example of shared decisionmaking involves the choice of techniques for colon cancer screening (Chap. 70). In controlled studies, the use of annual FOBT reduces colon cancer deaths by 15–30%. Flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colon cancer deaths by ~40–60%. Colonoscopy appears to offer a greater benefit than flexible sigmoidoscopy with a reduction in risk of ~70%, but its use incurs additional costs and risks. These screening procedures have not been compared directly in the same population, but models suggest that appropriate frequencies of each technique may be associated with similar numbers of lives saved and cost to society per life saved ($10,000– 25,000). Thus, although one patient may prefer the ease of preparation, less time disruption, and the lower risk of flexible sigmoidoscopy, others may prefer the sedation, thoroughness, and time interval of colonoscopy. \n\n#### ■ COUNSELING ON HEALTHY BEHAVIORS \n\n In considering the impact of preventive services, it is important to recognize that tobacco and alcohol use, diet, and exercise constitute the \n\n vast majority of factors that influence preventable deaths in developed countries. Perhaps the single greatest preventive health care measure is to help patients quit smoking (Chap. 454). However, efforts in these areas frequently require behavior changes (e.g., weight loss, exercise) or the management of addictive conditions (e.g., tobacco and alcohol use) that are often recalcitrant to intervention. Although these are challenging problems, evidence strongly supports the role of counseling by health care providers (Table 6-6) in effecting health behavior change. Educational campaigns, public policy changes, and community-based interventions have also proven to be important parts of a strategy for addressing these factors in some settings. Although the USPSTF found that the evidence was conclusive to recommend a relatively small set of counseling activities, counseling in areas such as physical activity and injury prevention (including seat belts and bicycle and motorcycle helmets) has become a routine part of primary care practice. \n\n#### ■ IMPLEMENTING DISEASE PREVENTION AND \n\n#### SCREENING \n\n The implementation of disease prevention and screening strategies in practice is challenging. A number of techniques can assist physicians with the delivery of these services. An appropriately configured electronic health record can provide reminder systems that make it easier for physicians to track and meet guidelines. Some systems give patients secure access to their medical records, providing an additional means to enhance adherence to routine screening. Systems that provide nurses and other staff with standing orders are effective for immunizations. The USPSTF has developed flow sheets and electronic tools to assist clinicians (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/ information-health-professionals). Many of these tools use age categories to help guide implementation. Age-specific recommendations for screening and counseling are summarized in Table 6-7. Many patients see a physician for ongoing care of chronic illnesses, and this visit provides an opportunity to include a “measure of prevention” for other health problems. For example, a patient seen for management of hypertension or diabetes can have breast cancer \n\n TABLE 6-5 Preventive Interventions Recommended for Average-Risk Adults INTERVENTION DISEASE POPULATION FREQUENCY CHAPTER Adult immunization 123, 124 Tetanus-diphtheria \u003e18 Every 10 years Varicella Susceptibles only, \u003e18 Two doses Measles-mumps-rubella Women, childbearing age One dose Pneumococcal \u003e64 13 followed by 23 valent Influenza \u003e18 Yearly Human papillomavirus Up to age 27 If not done prior Zoster \u003e60 Once Chemoprevention Aspirin Cardiovascular disease Aged 50–59 years with a ≥10% 10-year cardiovascular disease risk (bleeding risk may = benefit for some groups) Folic acid Neural tube defects in baby Women planning or capable of pregnancy Tamoxifen/raloxifene Breast cancer Women at high risk for breast cancer Vitamin D Fracture/falls \u003e64 at increased risk for falls \n\n TABLE 6-6 Preventive Counseling Recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) TOPIC CHAPTER REFERENCE Alcohol and drug use 453, 456, 457 Genetic counseling for BRCA1/2 testing among women at increased risk for deleterious mutations \n\n 79, 467 \n\n Nutrition and diet 332, 333 Sexually transmitted infections 136, 202 Sun exposure 61 Tobacco use 454 \n\n---\n\n#### Screening and Prevention of Disease \n\n#### CHAPTER 6 \n\n TABLE 6-7 Age-Specific Causes of Mortality and Corresponding Preventive Options \n\n AGE GROUP \n\n LEADING CAUSES OF AGE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY SCREENING PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS TO CONSIDER FOR EACH SPECIFIC POPULATION 15–24 1.

In developed countries, health systems have traditionally been classified by their type of financing—i.e., either predominantly tax-funded (such as the National Health Service in England and publicly operated regional care systems in the four European Nordic countries) or predominantly statutory social health insurance (SHI)-funded (such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and France). Over the past several decades, however, there has been structural convergence in the technical characteristics of both funding arrangements and in the associated delivery systems, making analytic observations about differences across national systems more difficult. A second confounding factor has been that former Soviet Bloc countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation, have, since 1991, replaced their former Soviet-style Semashko models (a top-down, national government–controlled funding and delivery structure with a parallel Communist Party administrative apparatus) with various hybrid arrangements built on national government–run SHI financing. Distinctions across developed country health systems, especially in Europe, have been further compressed by inadequate resources in many publicly funded systems in an era of rapid clinical and technological change, triggering increased private sector funding and provision. In middle-income developing countries, institutional structures in the health sector typically reflect the country’s preindependence administrative framework. Mexico, for example, has a Spanish-derived configuration with health insurance as part of social insurance for formally employed workers (via Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), supplemented by tax-funded health services (Seguro Popular) provided for those with informal employment and all other citizens, as well as a separate program (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado) for public employees. Countries such as India and Egypt, reflecting British influence, have predominantly tax-funded and publicly operated health systems. China is an exception, with an internally generated system that is publicly funded and operated, although recent Communist Party policy has been to introduce SHI-based \n\n# 7 \n\n## Global Diversity of Health \n\n## System Financing and \n\n## Delivery \n\n Richard B. Saltman \n\n insurance with individual medical savings accounts (patterned after Singapore), promote private insurance, and expand private hospitals. In lower-income developing countries, health services are typically provided by tax-funded public institutions, often with considerable inadequacies and sometimes with substantial copayments. It is important to note that governmentally organized systems in nearly all developing countries, as well as in former Soviet bloc countries and, to a lesser degree, in tax-funded developed countries, are supplemented to varying extents by a mix of private and/or employer-paid insurers and providers. This chapter focuses on the individual patient care system: on the financing and delivery of individual clinical and preventive services. The individual patient care system is composed of the financing and delivery of necessary services to prevent death or serious harm (“rule of rescue”); to maintain quality of life; and to manage, reduce, and/or prevent the burden of illness on individual patients. While the technical dimensions of most clinical services are similar across countries, their organizational, social, and economic characteristics range widely. Health systems in both developed and developing countries exhibit substantial differences, for example, in access to care; in the design and reliance on quality assurance and provider payment mechanisms; in the relationship of primary care to hospital services; in the coordination of health care with home care and nursing home services; in the design and use of provider management strategies; in the way physicians work and are paid; in the decision-making roles of politically elected officials and of national, regional, and municipal governments; and in participation of both citizens and patients. These wide-ranging institutional and organizational characteristics reflect differing country contexts (geographical, social, economic, and political), differences in national culture (consisting of prioritized norms and values), and substantial variation in how health sector institutions are structured. \n\n#### ■ FINANCING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CARE \n\n#### SERVICES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES \n\n Funding for individual care services in developed countries comes from the particular national mix among four possible sources of revenue: national, regional, and/or municipal taxes; mandatory SHI; private health insurance (including employer-paid insurances); and out-of-pocket payments. Most countries have one preponderant payer, which then defines its funding arrangements and serves to frame the structure of its delivery system as well. \n\n#### Total Health Expenditures The Organization for Economic \n\n Co-operation and Development (OECD) data from 2017 (adjusted for purchasing power parities) show that total health care expenditures in developed countries vary across a considerable range, tied to health system structure as well as national history and culture (Table 7-1). Per capita health expenditure figures provide a different, specific measurement of available funds in a country’s health sector (Table 7-2). \n\n#### Tax-Funded Systems In the United Kingdom, 79% of all health \n\n care funding was furnished through general tax revenues allocated by the national government in its annual budget process (all figures from OECD for 2017). In Sweden, all public taxes combined raised 83.7% of total health care spending. Sweden’s 21 regional-level elected governments provide approximately 70% of that 83.7%, with the remaining 13.7% of total health spending raised by national and municipal taxes. In Canada, 71% of total health spending was raised by tax revenues, with 66% of that 71% coming from provincial or territorial taxes, while 5% came from national and local government taxes. In most tax-funded countries, a segment of the population also has individual-, company-, or union-purchased private complementary and/or supplemental insurance coverage. In Sweden, 2019 estimates are that about 600,000 individuals have private complementary policies in a total population of 9 million. In Denmark, 50% of the population purchase supplemental insurance, while 30% have complementary insurance (often purchased by employers) that pays for private sector services enabling them to bypass public sector queues. In Finland, many middle-class families purchase separate private health insurance for their children to enable them to bypass long waiting times \n\n---\n\n#### Global Diversity of Health System Financing and Delivery \n\n#### CHAPTER 7 \n\n TABLE 7-1 Developed Country Total Health Expenditure (% GDP) TAX FUNDED IN WESTERN EUROPE \n\n SHI FUNDED IN WESTERN EUROPE CENTRAL EUROPEAN DEVELOPED ASIAN \n\n DEVELOPED NORTH AMERICAN Ireland 7.2% Belgium 10.3% Latvia 6.0% Singapore 4.5% Canada 10.7% Spain 8.9% Netherlands 10.1% Poland 6.5% South Korea 7.6% United States 17.1% UK 9.6% Germany 11.2% Czech Republic 7.2% Japan 10.9% Finland 9.6% Switzerland 12.3% Slovenia 8.2% Denmark 10.1% Sweden 11.0% \n\nAbbreviations: GDP, gross domestic product; SHI, social health insurance; UK, United Kingdom.

More than 400,000 Finnish children (in a total population of 5 million) have privately purchased policies. In England in 2015, individual-, employer-, and union-purchased private complementary insurance covered an estimated 10.5% of the population, or about 6 million people. In Canada, individuals are not allowed by law to purchase private complementary insurance (except for Supreme Court–ordered insurance for three backlogged surgical procedures in Quebec Province—2005 Chaoulli decision); however, approximately 65% of the population have employer-, union-, or private group–purchased supplemental insurance for non–publicly covered services such as outpatient pharmaceutical prescriptions and home care. \n\n#### Social Insurance–Funded Systems In Western Europe, SHI \n\nfunds have traditionally been organized on a private not-for-profit basis, but with statutory responsibilities under national law. When former Soviet Bloc countries in Eastern Europe regained their independence in 1991, they returned to pre–World War II SHI models, but because there was no remaining organizational infrastructure, these post-1991 arrangements typically became a single SHI fund, run as an arm of the national government. In the United States, the Medicare social insurance system for citizens over age 65, enacted in 1965, is organized as a single fund tied to the national Social Security (public pension) Administration, an independent agency within the national government, with reimbursement arrangements supervised by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) inside the Department of Health and Human Services. Medicare covers inpatient hospital care plus limited post-hospital nursing home services (Medicare Part A). Supplemental private insurance policies are bought by covered individuals to help pay for outpatient physician visits (Medicare Part B) and for outpatient pharmaceuticals (Medicare Part D). In Germany, 85% of the population is enrolled in one of 120 not-forprofit, monthly premium–based private SHI funds. This figure includes all individuals with annual incomes below 54,500 euros, who are required by law to join an SHI fund, as well as those with higher incomes who choose to enroll or remain. Eleven percent of the population—all having annual incomes above the mandatory SHI enrollment ceiling of 54,500 euros—have opted out of the SHI system to voluntarily enroll in claims-based private health insurance, whereas 4% of the citizenry is enrolled in sector-specific public programs such as the military. Since 2009, all SHI members pay a flat tax on gross monthly income as a contribution (8.2% in 2018, up to an upper income limit of 49,500 euros), which is transferred by their SHI fund to a national pool, \n\n TABLE 7-2 Developed Country Per Capita Health Expenditures TAX FUNDED IN WESTERN EUROPE \n\n SHI FUNDED IN WESTERN EUROPE CENTRAL EUROPEAN DEVELOPED ASIAN \n\n DEVELOPED NORTH AMERICAN Spain $2738 Belgium $4149 Latvia $874 South Korea $2043 Canada $4458 Italy $2738 Germany $4714 Poland $809 Singapore $4083 United States $9869 UK $3958 Netherlands $4742 Czech Republic $1321 Japan $4233 Denmark $5565 Switzerland $9835 Slovenia $1834 Sweden $5710 \n\nAbbreviations: SHI, social health insurance; UK, United Kingdom. \n\n and then redistributed back to their chosen fund on an individual risk-adjusted basis. Employers send 7.3% of each employee’s salary to the same national pool. Special arrangements exist for payments from self-employed, retired, and unemployed workers. Since 1995, there has been a separate mandatory social insurance fund for long-term care (LTC), with an annual premium of 1.95% of each adult’s gross monthly income, split 50%–50% with their employer. Pensioners since 2004 are required to pay the full 1.95% from their pensions. Childless SHI enrollees pay a surcharge of 0.25% of monthly gross income. Overall, 78% of all health care expenditures in Germany were paid from public and/or mandatory private SHI sources. In the Netherlands since 2006, all adult citizens pay a fixed premium (about 1453 euros in 2019) to their choice among 35 private health insurers (not-for-profit and for-profit), with four large insurance groups having over 1 million members each. In addition, employers pay 6.95% of salary below 51,400 euros for each employee into a national health insurance fund. Self-employed individuals pay 4.85% into the national fund for taxable income up to the same limit. Retired and unemployed individuals also make payments. In addition to the individual premiums paid to their choice of private insurance fund, payments from the national health insurance fund, adjusted by individual age, sex, and health characteristics, also are made to the individual’s chosen insurer. The Netherlands has a separate mandatory social insurance fund for LTC (the ABWZ, since 2015 the WLZ, and now only for residential nursing home care) to which each employee pays 9.5% of taxable income beneath 33,600 euros every year. Selfemployed, unemployed, and retired individuals also are required to pay premiums to the WLZ. Overall, including SHI revenues, public spending provided 87% of total health expenditures in 2014. In Estonia, a former Soviet Republic that re-established an SHI system in 1991 upon regaining its independence, there is one national SHI fund that is an arm of the national government. This fund collects mandatory payments of 13% from salaried workers and 20% from self-employed individuals, covering both health care and retirement pensions. Overall, including SHI revenues, public spending accounted for 74.5% of total health expenditures in 2017. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have predominantly SHI systems of funding for individual care services. In these Asian countries (except Japan), there is one SHI fund that typically is operated as an arm of the national government. In Singapore, starting in 1983, all employees up to age 50 have been required to place 20% of their income (employers add 16% more) into a personal health savings account to pay for direct health care costs, \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n managed in their name by the Singapore government, called a Medisave account. Medisave accounts have a maximum amount, are tax-exempt, and receive interest payments (currently set at 4%). Consistent with a Confucian emphasis on family, the funds that accumulate in the Medisave account can be spent on health care for family members as well. If the accumulated funds are not spent on health care during the insured’s life, they become part of the individual’s personal estate and are distributed as a tax-free inheritance to his or her designated heirs. In addition, Singaporean citizens are also automatically enrolled into a second government-run health insurance plan called MediShield that pays for supplemental catastrophic, chronic, and long-term care. While citizens can opt out, 90% of citizens remain in the program. The Singapore government also operates a third, wholly tax-funded payer called Medifund that, with approval of a local neighborhood committee, will pay hospital costs for 3–4% of the population who are recognized as indigent. In part reflecting the high level of mandatory individual saving, public funding provided only 54.5% of total health expenditures in 2016. In South Korea, a state-run SHI system was established in 1977, which in 1990 covered 30.9% of total health care costs. This percentage paid by the SHI system rose to 40.5% of total costs in 2017, with national tax revenue covering 16.9%, leaving out-of-pocket expenses at a relatively high 34.4% of total costs. Although there are legal ceilings on total out-of-pocket copayments for each 6-month period, over 70% of Korean adults purchase an additional private Voluntary Health Insurance policy to cover these additional direct expenditures. In 2000, three types of public SHI funds were merged into a single national state-run fund. As of 2018, 6% of an employee’s salary must be paid as a social insurance contribution into this fund, with employees and employers each paying 50% of that amount. In 2008, an additional SHI fund was introduced to pay for LTC, operated by the main state-run SHI fund to reduce administrative costs. Contributions to the LTC fund are set at 6.55% of the individual’s regular SHI contribution, coupled with 20% copayments for institutional care and 15% copayments for home care services. \n\n#### The United States There is no single preponderant source of \n\n health care spending in the United States. The federal government’s CMS reported that, for 2017, private health insurance covered 34% of total health expenditures, Medicare (mandatory SHI program for all citizens over 65) covered 20%, Medicaid (a joint federal-state welfare program for low-income citizens) covered 17%, and out-of-pocket paid 10%. Sources of funds for these programs were 28% from the federal government, 17% from state and local governments, 28% from private households, and 20% from private business (e.g., employers). The World Bank set public funding in the United States at 50.2% of total health expenditures in 2017. In 2010, the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extended privately provided but heavily regulated and federally subsidized health insurance to many lowand middle-income uninsured individuals and families. Since the same act reduced the availability of existing individually purchased private health insurance, the total increase in the number of newly covered individuals was less than expected. Insurance premium increases for 2017 rose from 20% to over 100%, depending on the particular state, with additional increases in up-front deductible requirements, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of the ACA initiative. The recent Republican administration sought to repeal major financial and tax elements of the ACA and to replace existing subsidy arrangements with a system of refundable tax credits toward the establishment of individual health savings accounts and/or purchase of private health insurance on open cross-state markets (currently, private health insurance in the United States remains controlled at the separate 50-state level of government). \n\n#### ■ DELIVERING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CARE \n\n#### SERVICES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES \n\n#### Hospital Services In Europe, hospitals in both tax-funded and \n\n SHI-funded health systems are mostly publicly owned and operated by regional or municipal governments. In tax-funded health systems, \n\n most hospital-based physicians are civil servants, employed on a negotiated salary basis (often by a physician labor union), and subject to most of the usual advantages and disadvantages of being a public sector employee. There are somewhat more private hospitals in SHI-funded health systems. However, most larger hospitals are public institutions operated by local governments, and most hospital physicians (with the notable exception of the Netherlands, where they are private contractors organized in private group practices) are, like those in tax-funded systems, public sector employees. In most tax-funded European countries (but not continental SHI-funded countries), few specialist physicians have office-based practices, and in both taxand SHI-funded systems, office-based specialists do not have admitting privileges to publicly operated hospitals. Most public hospitals in both tax-funded and SHI-funded health systems are single free-standing institutions that can be classified into three broad categories by complexity of patients admitted and number of specialties available: (1) district hospitals (four specialties: internal medicine, general surgery, obstetrics, and psychiatry); (2) regional hospitals (20 specialties); and (3) university hospitals (\u003e40 specialties). In addition, many countries have a number of small, 15to 20-bed, freestanding, private (typically for-profit) clinics. Recently, some taxfunded countries have begun to merge district and regional hospitals in an effort to improve the quality of care and create financial efficiencies (for example, Norway; planned for Denmark, also for Ireland; however, failed Parliamentary passage and brought down the coalition government, in Finland in 2019). Institutional mergers can be difficult to negotiate among publicly operated hospitals, due to the role that these large institutions play as important care providers and as large employers in smaller cities and towns, especially given political and union concerns about maintaining current employment levels. In the United States, financial and reimbursement pressures triggered by the implementation of the 2010 ACA have generated a number of private sector hospital mergers into larger hospital groups. In tax-funded health systems, publicly funded patients who are admitted for an elective procedure cannot choose their specialist physician (except private-pay patients in “pay beds” in National Health Service [NHS] hospitals in England). Specialists are assigned by the clinic to a patient based on availability, with both junior and senior doctors placed in rotation. Capital costs (buildings, large medical equipment) are publicly funded in all tax-funded systems and in most traditional SHI systems. For example, in Germany, capital costs for public hospitals are paid for by the regional governments. As a result, new capital investment is often allocated politically, according to location and political priorities. In Finland, local politicians in the 1980s would say that it “takes 10 years to build a hospital,” meaning that it took that long to become a political priority for the regional government that controlled capital expenditures. Local politicians would therefore regularly overbuild when they got their one opportunity to obtain new capital. Recently, efforts have been made to make public hospitals more responsible for their use of capital. In the Netherlands, public hospitals were shifted into private not-for-profit entities that are expected either to fund new capital from operating surplus or to borrow the funds from a bank based on a viable business plan. In England, more than 100 hospitals have been built using the Public Finance Initiative (PFI) program, in which private developers build turn-key facilities (thus taking capital costs off the public borrowing limit), and then rent these facilities back to the NHS and/or the relevant NHS Foundation Trust. In Sweden and Finland, while capital equipment is now a cost on hospital operating budgets, large new capital equipment and major building renovations remain politically driven processes often with extensive delays. In Stockholm County, the New Karolinska University Hospital opened in 2018 was built and is managed by a separate nonprofit public-private c omp any. In Singapore and South Korea, both of which are SHI funded, larger hospitals are publicly operated. However, there are a substantial number of smaller private clinics typically owned by specialist physicians. In the United States, the passage of the 2010 ACA has triggered the selling of many private specialist group practices to hospital groups, \n\n---\n\n#### Global Diversity of Health System Financing and Delivery \n\n#### CHAPTER 7 \n\ntransforming previously independent practicing physicians into hospital employees. \n\n#### Primary Care Services Most primary health care in SHI-funded \n\nhealth systems, and also in an increasing number of tax-funded health systems (except in low-income areas of some large cities), is delivered by independent private general practitioners (GPs), working either individually or in small privately owned group practices. Recent changes in tax-funded health systems include Norway, where most primary care moved from municipally employed physicians to private-practice GPs in 2003, and Sweden, where, following a 2010 change in national reimbursement requirements, new privately owned not-for-profit and for-profit GP practices were established and now deliver 50% of all primary care visits. In England, most primary care physicians are private GPs who are contractors to the NHS, working either independently or in small group practices. These private GPs own their own practices, which they can sell when they retire. However, as part of the original agreement to convince physicians to support the establishment of the NHS in 1948 (which most physicians strongly opposed), private GPs also receive a national government pension upon retirement. In the inner cities in England, there are some larger primary health clinics. In 2001, England’s private primary care doctors were organized into geographically based Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). These PCTs were allocated 80% of the total NHS budget to contract for elective hospital services required by their patients with both NHS hospital trusts as well as private hospitals. In 2013, PCTs were restructured into Clinical Commissioning Groups with similar contracting responsibilities. In 2004, the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) was introduced as a quality of care–tied approach to providing additional income for NHS GPs. This regulatory mechanism in 2010 set 134 different standards for best practice primary care in four main domains: 86 clinical, 36 organizational, 4 preventive service, and 3 patient experience. GP income grew on average by 25% through the introduction of the QOF, with general practices averaging 96% of possible QOF points. Total spending on QOF in 2014 in England consumed 15% of all primary care expenditures. In April 2019, a slightly revised QOF contract was implemented, which retired 28 low-value indicators, introduced 15 new more clinically appropriate indicators, added two Quality Improvement modules, and added a new personalized care adjustment option. Funding was only changed marginally. Access for individuals to primary care services is considered good in SHI-funded systems such as those in Germany and the Netherlands. One often-cited reason is that private office-based physicians (both GPs and specialists) in these countries are paid on a modified fee-forservice basis. In Germany, office-based physicians are paid on a quarterly basis by the Sickness funds, acting jointly at the Länder (regional) level through a point-based system. A national agreement between the physician association and the association of sick funds establishes points for each clinical act. Similarly, the association of sick funds (led in each of Germany’s 16 Länder by the fund with the most subscribers in that region) establishes a fixed budget for all office-based physician services for all sick fund patients each 3-month period. Retrospectively at the end of each period, the total number of points is divided into the sick funds’ fixed allocation for office-based physicians for that Länder for that quarter, establishing the value of a point for that quarter. Subsequently, each office-based physician’s point total is multiplied by that quarterly point value, resulting in that physician’s total payment from the statutory sick funds. In contrast to SHI systems, seeing a primary care doctor in a number of tax-funded health systems has become increasingly difficult over the past decade. In Sweden, in 2005, a “care guarantee” was introduced that required its predominantly publicly operated health centers to see a patient within 7 days after calling for an appointment. In Finland, where public primary health care centers used to provide most primary care visits, delays in getting public health center appointments have pushed up to 40% of all visits into a parallel occupational health system, as well as to publicly employed primary care physicians working privately in the afternoons. \n\n In England in 2019, access to GP services has been labeled a “crisis,” aggravated by a 6% fall in the number of practicing GPs, leading to delays of up to 30 days for an appointment in urban areas like London. A 2019 report by the King’s Fund found that only 1 in 20 trainee GPs planned to work full time. Also in 2019, the Nuffield Trust published a report suggesting that future planning for primary care services in England should assume a permanent shortage of GPs, requiring large numbers of new nurse practitioners and other auxiliary personnel. In Central European countries that were formerly within the Soviet Bloc, primary care provision had to be newly established after independence was regained in 1991, since first-line care in the former Semashko model was provided in specialist polyclinics. Primary care doctors rapidly emerged as almost entirely private for-profit GPs, working on contract from the national SHI fund (Estonia, Hungary, North Macedonia), from state-regulated private insurance companies (Czech Republic), or from regional/municipal public payers (Poland). Private GPs in most Central European countries now are paid on a per-visittied basis. This arrangement was heavily influenced by the structure of primary care in Germany, where private office-based GPs are paid according to a point-system-tied framework. In Asian countries such as Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, most primary care is provided by private for-profit GPs working independently or in small group practices. Private GPs are reimbursed at a set per-service fee by the national SHI fund(s). Access to primary care physicians is considered good. Developed countries have varying policies regarding access to individual preventive services. Health systems in most countries provide vaccinations and mammography as part of funded health care services. In the United States, most insured individuals—and in Canada, most covered residents—automatically receive an annual physical exam including full blood profiles. In Norway and Denmark, adult physical exams are provided only upon special request by the individual, and in Sweden, adult physical exams are provided only to pregnant women. In Sweden, adults who wish to know their cholesterol or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have begun to purchase blood tests out-of-pocket from private laboratories. In England in 2019, the NHS announced it would stop providing PSA screening tests for prostate cancer, even to men who requested one, similarly forcing concerned patients to purchase private laboratory testing. Patients must make copayments to see a primary care doctor in some tax-funded health systems and in most SHI countries. In taxfunded systems, for example, Swedish patients are required to make a county-council-set copayment for each primary care visit up to a national-government-set annual ceiling, after which ambulatory visits (both primary and outpatient specialist) are not charged. Finland has a fixed copay for public health center visits, while Denmark’s private GP visits do not have a copayment. In England, there is no copayment for GP visits. In SHI health care systems in Europe and in Asia, patients usually are responsible for a copayment for both primary and office-based specialist care. To defray these charges (and to pay for other nonfunded services), a high percentage of citizens typically purchase additional supplemental health insurance. In France, where 95% of patients in 2015 purchased private supplemental insurance, patients paid directly the full fee for 65% of outpatient primary and specialist services, reimbursed subsequently by both their SHI fund and their supplemental insurance carrier for all payments (after deductibles), while for 35% of services (for low-income individuals and certain high-cost procedures), full agreed prices were paid directly to providers by SHI. \n\n#### Access to Elective Specialist Care Approximately half of all \n\n European health care systems have a gatekeeping system that requires referrals from primary care physicians in order to book hospital specialist visits (for publicly paid visits). In most tax-funded health systems (although not in most SHI systems), there are substantial waiting times, typically several months or more, for elective specialist appointments as well as for high-tech diagnostic and treatment procedures. Waiting times can be particularly long for cancer and other elective surgical or high-demand services. In Sweden, government figures from the \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n summer of 2017 showed that, nationally, only 5–10% of prostate cancer operations were performed within 60 days after diagnosis. In the English NHS, waiting lists for elective surgery in 2019 were often 6 months or longer. In August 2017, there were over 4,000,000 patients on NHS waiting lists. In January 2018, what administrators termed “a severe flu season,” during which hospital emergency rooms were overwhelmed with elderly patients requiring admission, led to a national-level NHS decision to cancel all elective operating room procedures in all hospitals in England (\u003e50,000 procedures in 1200 hospitals) for the entire month of January, further lengthening waiting lists. Regarding quality of care, again in England, a March 2018 report from the national Office of Health Economics found that, in 2016 and 2017, up to three-quarters of patients who could have undergone keyhole procedures were forced to undergo open surgery, resulting in an estimated 1 million procedures each year that were more invasive than clinically necessary. Delays in some tax-funded systems also are procedural. In England, for example, a patient who requires a further consultation with a second specialist typically has to return to their primary care physician for a second referral and then has to wait in the regular patient queue for that second appointment. There is also substantial waiting time for radiologic imaging services in most tax-funded systems. In Malta, the tax-funded health system’s recent efforts to prioritize elective MRI investigations have succeeded in reducing waiting times from 18 months to 4 months. In both the Alberta and British Columbia Provinces in Canada, waiting times for a publicly funded nonemergency MRI can extend up to several months, whereas privately paid MRIs were available in both provinces within 1 week. This issue of waiting times for specialist services in tax-funded health systems reflects a combination of growing demand (increasing/ aging populations and changing clinical indications), financial constraints, and insufficient capacity, including inadequate physician working hours. For example, in the 1980s, when several surgical procedures for the elderly became more routine practice (e.g., hip replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, corneal lens implantation), the waiting list problem worsened. It had been mitigated somewhat through increased service capacity by the early 2000s, only to return as a growing policy challenge once public sector financial resources became constrained again after the 2008 global financial crisis. Timely cancer diagnosis and care continue to be a particularly sensitive issue, with tax-funded systems often taking several months for a patient to see an oncologist and then months more to begin treatment. In 2013 in Sweden, a newspaper journalist set off a political storm when he described women patients in one large county council (Malmo) who had to wait more than 40 days to receive the results from their breast cancer biopsy. In September 2019 in England, only 76.9% of patients with suspected cancer began treatment within 2 months of an urgent referral from a GP. In response to pressure from national patient associations, a number of tax-funded health care systems introduced maximum waiting times for elective hospital procedures in the early 2000s. (Most Western European SHI systems do not have long waiting times or treatment guarantees for hospital care.) These maximum waiting times typically include initial primary care visits as well as specialist evaluations and treatment. In Denmark, a patient has the right to go to a different Danish public hospital for care after waiting 30 days without treatment. In Sweden, under the 2005 “waiting time guarantee,” an untreated patient’s local county council is required to pay for care in another county’s hospital after 180 days. In a parallel process at the European Union (EU) level, beginning in 1997, the EU Court of Justice steadily expanded the right of all EU citizens to travel to another EU country in order to receive “timely” care, with their home country health system required to pay for that care. In private not-for-profit SHI-funded health systems such as in Germany and Switzerland, waiting times for specialist visits and hospital procedures are typically a few weeks to 1 month. In the SHI system in France, which is more centrally organized and funded (part of the Napoleonic tradition of public administration), ongoing disputes \n\n about insufficient central government funding for public hospitals and staff salaries led in March 2019 to 9 months of hospital staff strikes, particularly in accident and emergency departments. In November 2019, the national government announced that it would take over 10 billion euros in public hospital debt as part of an effort to reverse staff cutbacks, bed and operating theater closures, and personnel flight to the private sector. \n\n#### Long-Term Care Services LTC (consisting of residential and \n\n home-based services) consumes a relatively small but increasing proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) in developed countries. In 2016, Norway (2.95% GDP), Sweden (2.87% GDP), and the Netherlands (2.64% GDP) all spent more than one-fourth of their total health expenditures on LTC (Eurostat and OECD figures). More than one-fifth of all health care expenditures went to LTC in Belgium (2.16% GDP), Ireland (1.55% GDP), and Denmark (2.5% GDP). Lower-spending countries included the United Kingdom (18% of health expenditures; 1.75% GDP), Germany (12% of expenditures; 1.33% GDP), and Spain (9% of expenditures; 0.81% GDP). In the United States, official figures put total LTC expenditures in 2016 at 4.9% of total health expenditures, or 0.9% of total GDP. (Note that these figures do not include emergency, inpatient, or outpatient hospital costs generated by elderly patients.) Since nursing home care is more expensive than home care (nursing home care requires the provision of housing, food, and around-theclock care providers), government policymakers seek to keep the elderly and the chronically ill out of nursing homes for as long as feasible. Moreover, in developed countries like Sweden, Norway, and the United States, some 70% of all home care services come from informal caregivers: spouses, children (typically daughters), neighbors, and nonprofit community groups. While some SHI systems (e.g., Germany) have separate public LTC insurance (funded by mandatory premiums paid by all adults) that make available cash payments for LTC that can be used to compensate informal caregivers, most policymakers work hard to not monetize what is a large amount of essentially free care. Indeed, policymakers actively seek to encourage those providing these services to continue to do so as long as possible, trying to postpone caregiver burnout by providing support services such as free respite care, special call-in lines for caregiving advice, pension points toward retirement for the informal caregiver (Nordic countries), and free daycare center services. In most tax-funded and SHI-funded European countries, home care services are organized at the municipal government level. In tax-funded systems, these services are also delivered mostly by municipal employees, working according to union-negotiated protocols. In some European SHI systems, and recently in tax-funded Sweden and Finland, private companies also provide home care services on contract to municipal governments. In combination with national legislation, these municipal systems also provide important support for informal caregivers, since the financial costs of caring for adults in their own home are substantially less than providing housing, food, and caregiver support in publicly funded homes for the aged or in nursing homes. A high proportion of nursing homes in European tax-funded and SHI-funded health systems are publicly owned facilities operated by municipal governments; in some instances, in SHI-funded systems (Israel, the Netherlands), they are operated by private not-for-profit organizations. Recently, in some tax-funded systems (e.g., Sweden), private for-profit chains have begun to open nursing homes that are funded on a contract basis with local municipal governments. Costs for nursing home care can be expensive: in Norway, the cost per patient is often over $100,000 per year in a publicly funded home, with the patient responsible for paying up to 80% depending on the family’s economic status. In Sweden, patients living in publicly funded nursing homes in Stockholm County pay a relatively small official fee, but they also pay room rent and up to 2706 Swedish krona (SEK) per month (about $270 U.S. dollars [USD]) for food out of their monthly public pension payments. In 2012, in an effort to reduce demand for expensive hospital and nursing home services, Norway and Denmark began elderly care reforms that shifted service delivery as well as funding responsibilities \n\n---\n\n#### Global Diversity of Health System Financing and Delivery \n\n#### CHAPTER 7 \n\nto municipal governments. Among innovations in Norway, municipalities are required to establish a municipal acute bed unit (MAU) to treat stable elderly patients and provide observation beds for evaluation. Partial funding for these units is provided by the four public regional health care administrations. Some municipalities have also embedded primary care units inside their regional hospital to arrange discharge and to coordinate care for the chronically ill elderly. Norwegian municipalities are also responsible through their contracted (mostly private) primary care physicians to implement the National Pathways Program, which established treatment protocols for cross-sector conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. A differently configured structural innovation to better integrate LTC for the chronically ill elderly with clinical individual health services has been to consolidate both social and health care services within the same public administrative organization. In 2019, as part of health reforms in Ireland and Denmark and a proposed (unenacted) reform in Finland, as well as a pilot decentralization program in England for 2.8 million people in Greater Manchester, social and health care programs are to be administered by a single responsible agency. In the SHI-funded system in the Netherlands, almost 7% of the population live in a residential home. National government legislation revised the structure of nursing home funding and care in 2015. Three acts restructured the separate public LTC SHI fund, which requires mandatory payments by 100% of Dutch adults, and introduced delivery-related reforms that reduced the number and overall cost of nursing home patients paid for by the fund. Determination of eligibility for public payment for nursing home care is now made by an independent national assessment body (the Centre for Needs Assessment). Moreover, municipal governments now play a stronger role in funding and delivering home care services. The reforms created social care teams that hold “kitchen table talks” to steer the elderly first toward seeking care from family, neighbors, churches, and other local community organizations before they qualify for publicly paid in-home care. In 2012, some 1.5 million people (12% of total population) provided informal care to ill or disabled persons, averaging 22 hours per week of care per person. Home care recipients in the Netherlands can choose to set up a “personal budget,” using their public funding allocation to select their preferred individual care personnel (either publicly employed or publicly approved private providers). This arrangement also enables these home care recipients to determine the particular mix of services they want, as well as to augment the allocated public funds with personal funds. A number of innovative not-for-profit nursing homes have been created to provide additional services to elderly living in their neighborhood (primary care home visits), as well as terminal hospice care (e.g., the Saffier De Residentie Groep residences in The Haag). In the United States, nursing home and home care are funded and delivered in a variety of different ways. For individuals who have minimal financial assets, nursing home costs are paid by a joint federal-regional (state) welfare program called Medicaid. Most state government Medicaid programs pay out more than 40% of their total budget for nursing home care. In the past, Medicaid did not pay for home care services. However, some states have programs with private for-profit and not-forprofit providers that provide home care as a way to forestall the need for the more expensive nursing home care. Many private individuals take out private LTC insurance, typically from commercial insurance companies. These policies require individuals to make premium payments for years in advance (often 20 or more) before the individual learns whether they will, in fact, require home or nursing home care. Some private insurers have also raised premiums after individuals have paid in for many years and canceled policies if the new higher rate is not affordable. The 2010 ACA contained a new public LTC insurance program. However, the program was designed to be voluntary, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services administrators decided in 2013 not to implement that portion of the law. In addition to the tax-funded Medicaid program and privately purchased LTC insurance, many middle-class families pay for care from savings, by selling the elderly person’s home, or by direct contribution \n\n from children and other family members. Expenses can reach between $60,000 and $100,000 per year depending on the location of a facility and who operates it. Nursing home care in the United States is provided by a wide mix of private not-for-profit and for-profit providers, ranging from churchowned single-site homes to large stock market–listed companies. Many of these homes are purpose-built as assisted-living or memory-care facilities. Home care services are delivered by a mix of private not-forprofit and for-profit providers. In Japan, a national LTC insurance fund was introduced in \n\n2000. Although the new fund applies uniformly across the country, the program is administered by municipal governments and the pre- mium level differs across municipalities, with an average monthly premium of 3000 yen (about $30 USD). In South Korea, an SHI fund for LTC is funded by mandatory contributions of 4.78% of a person’s regular national health insurance contribution, with an additional 20% of total LTC expenditures provided by national government funds. The client copayment for home care is set at 15% of expenses and at 20% for residential care. \n\n#### ■ PHARMACEUTICALS \n\n Pharmaceutical expenditures in developed countries (inpatient and outpatient combined) vary widely across different health system types, as well as between different countries within each institutional type. OECD figures for 2018 show drug expenditures in tax-funded countries in Western Europe ranging from 6.3% of total health expenditures (THE) in Denmark to 11.9% of THE in the United Kingdom and 18.6% of THE in Spain. In SHI-funded Western European systems, pharmaceuticals absorbed 7.5% of THE in the Netherlands, while in Germany, that figure was 14.1%. In the hybrid tax-funded SHI systems of Central Europe, the pharmaceutical percentage of THE is higher: 18.2% of THE in Estonia to 27.9% of THE in Hungary. Similarly, in Asian SHI systems, pharmaceuticals consumed 20.7% of THE in South Korea and 18.6% of THE in Japan. The OECD’s 2018 figures for pharmaceutical spending in North America are 12.0% of THE in the United States and 16.7% in Canada. Contributing factors to this wide-ranging variation are (1) differences in national practice and prescription patterns reflecting differing cultural expectations; (2) the ratio problem (relatively fixed level of pharmaceutical costs due to international prices—the numerator— divided by a greatly varying per capita health expenditure cost in different developed country health systems); (3) the range and type of pharmaceutical price controls in each country; and (4) the degree of limitation placed on pharmaceutical supply, tied to formularies and/or explicit forms of drug rationing. Most European health systems have tight national controls on the cost and, in some tax-based countries, on the availability of pharmaceuticals. Most European countries also use a number of different regulatory measures to limit prices and/or availability of both inpatient and outpatient drugs, including mandatory generic prescribing, reference pricing, patient copays (sometimes with an annual ceiling, after which copayments are no longer required), and (particularly in tax-funded systems) national formularies tied to clinical effectiveness. Norway, for example, allows only about 2300 different preparations—including dosage, delivery method, and box size—to be stocked by pharmacies. Prices for drugs can vary considerably across different European countries, tied to economic development and domestic pricing patterns. One consequence of these differential national pricing controls has been the development of a parallel import market, in which drug wholesalers and pharmacists in the more expensive countries purchase supplies from a cheaper market elsewhere in Europe. Access to expensive drugs has also been intentionally limited in some tax-funded health systems in Europe. One basis for rationing has been rationing tied to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Rationing also reflects a clash between strained public drug budgets and public pressure. For example, in the case of cancer drugs in England, the recommendation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) against funding the breast cancer drug trastuzumab (Herceptin) was subsequently overturned by the Minister of Health. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n Expensive cancer drugs continue to be rationed in England where the NHS Cancer Drug Fund, established in 2011 to provide access to nonNHS-provided drugs on a case-by-case basis, ran out of funds in 2015, forcing it to drop 25 of 83 covered drugs and close down for 3 months to restructure its operations. As part of earlier medical patterns in Asian countries, office-based physicians traditionally filled prescriptions as well as prescribing drugs to patients. These sales also served to supplement their income in a setting of relatively low per-visit payments from state-run SHI funds. Concerned about cost and overuse, both Taiwan (in 1997, except for emergency cases or rural regions) and South Korea (for the whole country in 2003) implemented “separation reforms,” which ended these physician sales. In Japan, a series of fee and reimbursement reforms have trimmed the percentage of all prescriptions dispensed in 2016 by physicians to 26% of prescriptions filled. \n\n#### ■ GOVERNANCE AND REGULATION \n\n Health care services in developed countries are steered, constrained, monitored, and (to varying degrees) assessed by governments and governmentally established and/or empowered bodies. Although these measures apply particularly to the financial efficiency of governmentfunded services, they also seek to promote patient and community safety, equity of access, and high-quality clinical outcomes. This oversight is often strongly focused on privately operated and contracted providers and insurers, although in principle, it applies to publicly operated organizations as well. Governance consists of macro national-level policy, meso institutional-level management, and micro clinic-level care decisions. This complex mix of governance decisions is often shared among different national, regional, and local governments, depending on the degree of centralization, decentralization, or, recently, recentralization (e.g., Norway and Denmark). While most systems officially prioritize “good governance,” governance activities frequently comingle with political objectives as core policy concepts are developed and transformed into concrete organizational targets. In Sweden, health system governance is shared among national, regional (county), and local municipal governments. The national government has responsibility to pass “frame” legislation, which establishes the basic structure of the system. To cite one example, until recently, the national government had limited an adult patient’s total copayments for outpatient physician care (specialist and primary care) and pharmaceuticals to 2800 SEK (about $280 USD) for a 12-month period. The 20 regional governments, in turn, made policy decisions within that legislation, deciding how to apportion the specific copayments for each primary care and specialist outpatient visit. Since Swedes can self-refer to specialists, some counties double the copayment to hospital-based doctors to discourage unnecessary appointments. Similarly, fiscal policy normally is shared between the regional government, which raises about 70% of total health expenditures through its own county-set flat income tax, and the national government, which provides additional purpose-tied funds for national objectives such as consolidating openheart surgery across county lines as well as supplementing lower tax receipts in rural counties with smaller working populations. However, this normal funding relationship across governments can change. In the early 1990s, the national government placed a “stop” on raising county taxes prior to Sweden’s admission in 1995 to the EU. In 2016, each of the 20 counties could set their own ceilings, which were almost all at 3300 SEK (about $330 USD). In Spain’s tax-funded health system (71.1% publicly funded in 2015), 17 regional “autonomous communities” were given full managerial responsibility for the provision of health services in a 1990s decentralization process, along with ownership of all publicly operated hospitals. The national government generates a substantial proportion of health care resources, which are included in the broad block grants it allocates to the regional governments, which then add regional tax revenue to make up the full public sector budget. In a mechanism to steer regional government operating policies in this decentralized environment, the national Spanish government established a joint federal-regional council to review quality and performance data (through the 2003 Health \n\n System Cohesion and Quality Act). Italy’s tax-funded health system (75.8% publicly funded in 2014) similarly shares governance responsibilities between national and regional governments. Health services are provided by local health authorities (Azienda Sanitaria Locale) supervised by 20 regional governments within a nationally established governance framework, financed through a complicated mix of national and nationally stipulated but regionally collected taxes. Again, like Spain, the national government established a federal-regional government council, seeking to better coordinate care standards and information among the regions and with national government agencies. In 2006, the national government imposed strict financial plans on 10 regions that were systematically in deficit. In Germany, where funding for its SHI-based health system is predominantly the responsibility of 120 private not-for-profit sickness funds, governance decisions are shared among these private sector sickness funds and public sector national, regional, and municipal governments. The sickness funds receive a risk-adjusted premium payment for each enrolled individual, according to a national government–determined formula, and from a national government– run health insurance pool. Most hospitals are owned and operated by municipal governments, while investment capital for structural renovations and new building comes from the 16 regional Länder taken from their tax revenues. Payment frameworks and amounts for public hospitals are negotiated between associations of these municipally owned hospitals and associations of the private sickness funds, without formal government participation. Regulation is an essential element of an effective health care system and a key component of overall health system governance. Regulation incorporates both broad standard requirements that affect all organizations that operate in a country (e.g., hiring, firing, and wage decisions) as well as specific health sector–related regulations (e.g., proper handling, use, and disposal of low-grade nuclear waste from radiation treatments). Recent examples of health sector regulation in England, for example, include the following: \n\n1. Requiring all cancer drugs adopted for use in the NHS to cost no     more than $41,268/QALY; \n\n2. Requiring in their employment contract that junior doctors in hos-     pitals work a specific number of Sundays; and \n\n3. Requiring that all emergency department patients receive care     within 4 h of their arrival.     A powerful tool that has the force of law, regulation can have sub- stantial negative as well as positive effects. A well-known political science corollary of regulatory power is that “the right to regulate is also the right to destroy.” For example, in the United States, the federal Environmental Protection Agency, as part of its pursuit of cleaner air, issued wide-ranging regulatory orders setting performance standards that resulted in the closing of many West Virginia coal mines, with the loss of tens of millions of dollars of productive capacity and thousands of high-paying jobs, and likely contributing to social conditions that helped spawn that state’s high rates of opioid abuse among unem- ployed males. Similarly, in some tax-funded European systems, such as those in Sweden and England, there is growing pressure from public health advocates for national regulations to prohibit the making of a profit from publicly paid funds. In Sweden, the national government’s Reepalu report in 2016 honored a pledge made by the Social Demo- cratic government to its Left (socialist) Party ally by calling for a legis- lated ban on profit-making in the provision of publicly funded health care services. The report’s publication triggered substantial divestment of existing investor-owned primary care, nursing home, and home care companies. \n\n#### ■ FUTURE CHALLENGES \n\n Health systems in developed countries face continued challenges in the coming years. These include financial, organizational, and policy dilemmas for which institutionally viable, financially sustainable, and politically supportable solutions will be complicated to develop and difficult to implement. On the delivery side, a key question is whether \n\n---\n\n#### Global Diversity of Health System Financing and Delivery \n\n#### CHAPTER 7 \n\nprivately structured GP-based primary care is more efficient and effective than various clinic-based forms of primary care services. Recent movement in Northern and Central Europe toward more private GPs, along with continued private office–based primary care in much of Canada, the United States, and economically developed countries in Asia, raises complex policy issues for international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as national policymakers. In the hospital sector, existing levels of clinical quality and patient responsiveness in publicly operated command-and-control institutions will increasingly have to compete with those of semi-autonomous public hospitals, as well as various types of private, sometimes very innovative providers. In the financing arena, continued pressure on publicly raised health system revenues is likely to erode longtime commitments in some tax-funded health systems to minimal patient copayments and low out-of-pocket funding. An additional set of challenges will arise from recent commitments by international organizations like WHO to restructure health systems in developed countries to better address the social determinants of health. This new, incomplete strategy calls for a dramatic expansion of health sector responsibility to include a wide range of existing institutional arrangements in housing, education, work-life, and social and political decision-making. The influential 2010 Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England entitled “Fair Society, Healthy Lives,” led by Sir Michael Marmot, a British epidemiologist, called for the elimination of all “inequities in power, money, and resources.” Separate from the political dimensions of this proposed new paradigm, how such fundamental societal change will be funded and implemented has yet to be addressed. Looking forward, among the most essential challenges to national decision-makers in the coming period will be four specific health system imperatives: \n\n1. **Finding a more sustainable balance between ethics and funding.**     Policymakers in publicly funded health systems face a growing     gap between patient expectations of high-quality clinical care, staff     expectations of better compensation, and the economic imperative     of no new taxes. Recent research has suggested that SHI-funded     health systems, faced with increasing aging and thus proportionally     fewer employed, face a similar gap. While the present solidaristic     foundation for raising collective revenues is insufficient, available     nonsolidaristic tools (copayments, supplemental insurance, private     pay) inevitably contribute to overall inequality. But what then are the     realistic policy alternatives? The minimalist new policy goal neces-     sarily will have to become one of raising new revenues while doing     the least economic and social harm. \n\n2. **Developing better strategies to steer provider diversity.**     Health systems in developed countries are becoming more diverse     with more and different types of public owners: hospital trusts, state     enterprises, and mixed public-private hospital owners/managers.     There also are more and different types of private providers: not-for-     profit community groups, foundations, and cooperatives, as well as     for-profit small local entrepreneurs, large international companies,     and risk capital funds (venture capital). Furthermore, new innova-     tive delivery models are reorganizing traditional service boundaries:     not-for-profit private nursing homes in the Netherlands also provide     outpatient primary care to neighborhood elderly patients, as well     as hospice care; Israeli technology companies combine high-tech     home-based patient monitoring with standard medical and cus-     todial home care services. Public pressure from citizens for more     choice and better outcomes will pressure policymakers toward new,     more accommodative health system arrangements. A 2019 national     government report in Sweden on the hospital sector recommended     a new emphasis on better access to out-of-office hours and out-of-     hospital acute care by private as well as public providers. \n\n3. **Ensuring better coordination between social and health services.**     Tax-funded and SHI-funded systems alike are under intense policy     pressure to develop better strategies to integrate services for the     chronically ill elderly, as a way to improve the quality of services     that these patients receive and to keep them at home healthier and \n\n longer, reducing expensive acute visits to hospitals and emergency departments. The clear delivery system goal will increasingly be to keep the elderly out of nursing homes and acute care facilities for as long as possible. \n\n4. **Building labor unions into provider innovation.**     In many developed countries, health sector staff, including hospital     physicians, are members of labor unions. Effective policymaking     will require finding mechanisms to build these personnel unions     into accelerated health system restructuring processes. This process     will necessarily involve integrating unions into more innovative,     flexible, fiscally sustainable organizational arrangements with con-     tracts that reward active participation in organizational change,     contracts that pay incentives to more productive employees, quicker     reassignment and redundancy procedures (firing health sector     workers can take a year or longer in some European health systems),     and establishing profit-sharing payments to teams/unions, also in     public sector organizations. \n\n While the structure and complexity of resolving these specific organizational challenges will vary depending on a country’s cultural and institutional context, the commonality of these problems suggests that health systems in the developed world require a new, broader range of targeted policy strategies and solutions. \n\n#### ■ FINANCING AND PROVIDING HEALTH SERVICES \n\n#### IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (See also Chap. 474) \n\n Health systems in developing countries reflect a complex combination of the same core elements found in developed country systems (hospitals, primary care facilities, medical staff, pharmaceuticals) adapted to different, widely varying organizational, social, political, and economic contexts and conditions. System structure and provider institutions typically vary by differing national characteristics including historical relationships (Anglophone/Francophone/Hispanic/Soviet Semashko/ American institutional and educational links); GDP and per capita annual national income (lowor middle-income developing countries); political norms and values; and ethnic and/or cultural mix. Predominantly public sector funding, particularly in lower-income countries, typically generates substantially lower levels of resources per capita than in developed countries and tends to be less reliable, particularly in countries where the economy is dependent on commodity exports. Service delivery arrangements in developing countries, in turn, typically have higher provider-to-population ratios as well as, in public sector institutions, more mixed quality of care. In a number of middle-income developing countries, migration of trained medical staff to practice in higher-paying developed country health systems (often going to countries with historical relationships and/or where they received advanced training) further depletes available medical resources. In nearly all developing countries, private sector providers play an important supplemental role, with some middle-income developing countries like China currently encouraging their further development. Most middleand lower-income developing countries struggle to fund high-quality individual health services. Recent emphasis on universal health coverage has intensified that struggle. In middle-income developing countries (Table 7-3) , World Bank data from 2016 show \n\n TABLE 7-3 Middle-Income Developing Countries: Total Health Expenditure (% of gross domestic product) Middle-Income Developing Countries Kazakhstan 3.53% Thailand 3.71% Malaysia 3.80% Turkey 4.31% China 4.98% Botswana 5.46% Mexico 5.47% Colombia 5.91% \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n TABLE 7-4 Low-Income Developing Countries: Total Health Expenditure (% of gross domestic product) Low-Income Developing Countries Nigeria 3.65% India 3.66% Ethiopia 3.97% Nepal 6.29% Honduras 8.40% \n\n TABLE 7-5 Middle-Income Developing Countries: Per Capita Health Expenditures Middle-Income Developing Countries Thailand $221 Kazakhstan $262 Colombia $340 Malaysia $361 Botswana $379 China $398 Mexico $461 Turkey $468 \n\n TABLE 7-6 Low-Income Developing Countries: Per Capital Health Expenditures Low-Income Developing Countries Ethiopia $27 Nepal $45 India $62 Nigeria $79 Honduras $199 \n\n a range of health expenditure rates as a percentage of GDP, including Kazakhstan at 3.53% of GDP, Thailand at 3.71%, Malaysia at 3.80%, Turkey at 4.31%, China at 4.98%, Botswana at 5.46%, Mexico at 5.47%, and Colombia at 5.91%. Total health spending in low-income developing countries (Table 7-4) ranges from 3.65% of GDP for Nigeria, 3.66% for India, 3.97% for Ethiopia, 6.29% for Nepal, to 8.40% for Honduras. Given lower aggregate GDP levels, per capita annual expenditures are considerably less than those found in developed countries. In middle-income developing countries (Table 7-5) , Thailand spent (2016 data in adjusted USD) $221 annually per person, Kazakhstan spent $262, Colombia spent $340, Malaysia spent $361, Botswana spent $379, China spent $398, Mexico spent $461, and Turkey spent $468. Among low-income developing countries (Table 7-6) , Ethiopia spent $27 per person annually, Nepal spent $45, India spent $62, and Nigeria spent $79, whereas Honduras spent $199. China provides an interesting example of financing and service delivery development in middle-income developing countries. Financing reforms replaced fully publicly funded services with three new arrangements tied to work status and residence: (1) Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance in 1998 (incorporating privately funded medical savings accounts—a concept pioneered in Singapore); (2) Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance in 2007; and (3) New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme in 2007. The urban employee program is an SHI model reflecting the rapid rate of economic growth and increasing incomes for urban workers. Starting in 2013, the Chinese government increasingly emphasized the development of new private hospitals and promotion of private insurance in urban areas. These and other health sector reforms became possible as continued strong economic growth over 30 years raised an estimated 300 million Chinese into the middle class, generating the requisite private as well as public revenues to underpin major structural health sector change. Service delivery in developing countries varies widely in access, quality, and outcomes across and also within many developing countries. Medical services and tertiary institutions in urban areas of China, for example, operate at a substantially higher standard of service than those typically available in poorer rural regions. Similar disparities exist in wealthier parts of India such as Rajasthan, whereas in poorer states such as Bihar, primary care is mostly delivered by community “volunteers” with basic medical training, supervised by a GP. Two critical challenges for all developing country health systems are contingent on generating adequate future funding flows. First, the current push from United Nations agencies to achieve universal health coverage will require additional public and private sector funding to \n\n pay for the necessary new providers and services. Second, available funding will need to be more effectively targeted on needed and appropriate services, with minimized managerial inefficiencies and substantially less political corruption. Both forms of expanded funding will be dependent on strong national and global economic growth, which in turn will require continued country-level economic and political reforms. Achieving both funding-related objectives will require considerable international as well as national effort. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Barber SL et al: Price Setting and Price Regulation in Health Care: Lessons for Advancing Universal Health Coverage.

In recent years, it has become easier to measure safety and quality, and it is increasingly clear that performance in both dimensions could be much better. The public is—with good justification—demanding measurement and accountability, and payment for services will increasingly be based on performance in these areas. Thus, physicians must learn about these two domains, how they can be improved, and the relative strengths and limitations of the current ability to measure them. Safety and quality are closely related but do not completely overlap. The Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series of reports that safety is the first part of quality and that the health care system must first and foremost guarantee that it will deliver safe care, although quality is also pivotal. In the end, it is likely that more net clinical \n\n# 8 \n\n## The Safety and Quality of \n\n## Health Care \n\n David W. Bates \n\n---\n\n#### The Safety and Quality of Health Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 8 \n\n action when one is interrupted partway through it by a page, for example. Approaches that may be helpful in this area include minimizing interruptions and setting up tools that help define the urgency of an interruption. Complexity represents a key issue that contributes to errors. Providers are confronted by streams of data (e.g., laboratory tests and vital signs), many of which provide little useful information but some of which are important and require action or suggest a specific diagnosis. Tools that emphasize specific abnormalities or combinations of abnormalities may be helpful in this area. Transitions between providers and settings are also common in health care, especially with the advent of the 80-h workweek, and generally represent points of vulnerability. Tools that provide structure in exchanging information—for example, when transferring care between providers—may be helpful. \n\n#### The Frequency of Adverse Events in Health Care Most large \n\n studies focusing on the frequency and consequences of adverse events have been performed in the inpatient setting; some data are available for nursing homes, but much less information is available about the outpatient setting. The Harvard Medical Practice Study, one of the largest studies to address this issue, was performed with hospitalized patients in New York. The primary outcome was the adverse event: an injury caused by medical management rather than by the patient’s underlying disease. In this study, an event either resulted in death or disability at discharge or prolonged the length of hospital stay by at least 2 days. Key findings were that the adverse event rate was 3.7% and that 58% of the adverse events were considered preventable. Although New York is not representative of the United States as a whole, the study was replicated later in Colorado and Utah, where the rates were essentially similar. Since then, other studies using analogous methodologies have been performed in various developed nations, and the rates of adverse events in these countries appear to be ~10%. Rates of safety issues appear to be even higher in developing and transitional countries; thus, this is clearly an issue of global proportions. In the Harvard Medical Practice Study, adverse drug events (ADEs) were most common, accounting for 19% of all adverse events, and were followed in frequency by wound infections (14%) and technical complications (13%). Almost half of adverse events were associated with a surgical procedure. Among nonoperative events, 37% were ADEs, 15% were diagnostic mishaps, 14% were therapeutic mishaps, 13% were procedure-related mishaps, and 5% were falls. ADEs have been studied more than any other error category. Studies focusing specifically on ADEs have found that they appear to be much more common than was suggested by the Harvard Medical Practice Study, although most other studies use more inclusive criteria. Detection approaches in the research setting include chart review and the use of a computerized ADE monitor, a tool that explores the database and identifies signals that suggest an ADE may have occurred. Studies that use multiple approaches find more ADEs than does any individual approach, and this discrepancy suggests that the true underlying rate in the population is higher than would be identified by a single approach. About 6–10% of patients admitted to U.S. hospitals experience an ADE. Injuries caused by drugs are also common in the outpatient setting. One study found a rate of 21 ADEs per every 100 patients per year when patients were called to assess whether they had had a problem with one of their medications. The severity level was lower than in the inpatient setting, but approximately one-third of these ADEs were preventable. The period immediately after a patient is discharged from the hospital appears to be very risky. A recent study of patients hospitalized on a medical service found an adverse event rate of 19%; about one-third of those events were preventable, and another one-third were ameliorable (i.e., they could have been made less severe). ADEs were the single leading error category. \n\n#### Prevention Strategies Most work on strategies to prevent adverse \n\n events has targeted specific types of events in the inpatient setting, with nosocomial infections and ADEs having received the most attention. Nosocomial infection rates have been reduced greatly in intensive care \n\n Successive layers of defenses, barriers, and safeguards \n\n Other holes due to latent conditions (resident “pathogens”) \n\n Some holes due to active fa ilures \n\n Hazards \n\nLosses \n\n**FIGURE 8-1 “Swiss cheese” diagram.** Reason argues that most accidents occur when a series of “latent failures” are present in a system and happen to line up in a given instance, resulting in an accident. Examples of latent failures in the case of a fall might be that the unit is unusually busy and the floor happens to be wet. (Adapted from J Reason: BMJ 320:768, 2000.) \n\nbenefit will be derived from improving quality than from improving safety, though both are important and safety is in many ways more tangible to the public. The first section of this chapter will address issues relating to the safety of care and the second will cover quality of care. \n\n#### ■ SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE \n\n#### Safety Theory and Systems Theory Safety theory clearly points \n\nout that individuals make errors all the time. Think of driving home from the hospital: you intend to stop and pick up a quart of milk on the way home but find yourself entering your driveway without realizing how you got there. Everybody uses low-level, semiautomatic behavior for many activities in daily life; this kind of error is called a slip. Slips occur often during care delivery—e.g., when people intend to write an order but forget because they must complete another action first. Mistakes, by contrast, are errors of a higher level; they occur in new or nonstereotypic situations in which conscious decisions are being made. An example would be dosing of a medication with which a physician is not familiar. The strategies used to prevent slips and mistakes are often different. Systems theory suggests that most accidents occur as the result of a series of small failures that happen to line up in an individual instance so that an accident can occur **(Fig. 8-1)**. It also suggests that most individuals in an industry such as health care are trying to do the right thing (e.g., deliver safe care) and that most accidents thus result from defects in systems. Systems should be designed both to make errors less likely and to identify those that do inevitably occur. \n\n#### Factors That Increase the Likelihood of Errors Many factors \n\nubiquitous in health care systems can increase the likelihood of errors, including fatigue, stress, interruptions, complexity, and transitions. The effects of fatigue in other industries are clear, but its effects in health care have been more controversial until recently. For example, the accident rate among truck drivers increases dramatically if they work over a certain number of hours in a week, especially with prolonged shifts. A recent study of house officers in the intensive care unit demonstrated that they were about one-third more likely to make errors when they were on a 24-h shift than when they were on a schedule that allowed them to sleep 8 h the previous night. The American College of Graduate Medical Education has moved to address this issue by putting in place the 80-h workweek. Although this stipulation is a step forward, it does not address the most important cause of fatigue-related errors: extended-duty shifts. High levels of stress and heavy workloads also can increase error rates. Thus, in extremely high-pressure situations, such as cardiac arrests, errors are more likely to occur. Strategies such as using protocols in these settings can be helpful, as can simple recognition that the situation is stressful. Interruptions also increase the likelihood of error and occur frequently in health care delivery. It is common to forget to complete an \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n settings, especially by using checklists. For ADEs, several strategies have been found to reduce the medication error rate, although it has been harder to demonstrate that they reduce the ADE rate overall, and no studies with adequate power to show a clinically meaningful reduction have been published. Implementation of checklists to ensure that specific actions are carried out has had a major impact on rates of catheter-associated bloodstream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia, two of the most serious complications occurring in intensive care units. The checklist concept is based on the premise that several specific actions can reduce the frequency of these issues; when these actions are all taken for every patient, the result has been an extreme reduction in the frequency of the associated complication. These practices have been disseminated across wide areas in the state of Michigan. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) linked with clinical decision support reduces the rate of serious medication errors, defined as those that harm someone or have the potential to do so. In one study, CPOE, even with limited decision support, decreased the serious medication error rate by 55%. CPOE can prevent medication errors by suggesting a default dose, ensuring that all orders are complete (e.g., that they include dose, route, and frequency), and checking orders for allergies, drug–drug interactions, and drug–laboratory issues. In addition, clinical decision support can suggest the right dose for a patient, tailoring it to the level of renal function and age. In one study, patients with renal insufficiency received the appropriate dose only one-third of the time without decision support, whereas that fraction increased to approximately two-thirds with decision support; moreover, with such support, patients with renal insufficiency were discharged from the hospital half a day earlier. As of 2019, over 95% of U.S. hospitals had implemented CPOE, although the decision support often is still limited. Another technology that can improve medication safety is bar coding linked with an electronic medication administration record. Bar coding can help ensure that the right patient gets the right medication at the right time. Electronic medication administration records can make it much easier to determine what medications a patient has received. Studies to assess the impact of bar coding on medication safety are under way, and the early results are promising. Another technology to improve medication safety is “smart pumps.” These pumps can be set according to which medication is being given and at what dose; the health care professional will receive a warning if too high a dose is about to be administered. \n\n#### The National Safety Picture Several organizations, including \n\n the National Quality Forum and The Joint Commission, have made recommendations for improving safety. The National Quality Forum has released recommendations to U.S. hospitals about what practices will most improve the safety of care, and all hospitals are expected to implement these recommendations. Many of these practices arise frequently in routine care. One example is “readback,” the practice of recording all verbal orders and immediately reading them back to the physician to verify the accuracy of what was heard. Another is the consistent use of standard abbreviations and dose designations; some abbreviations and dose designations are particularly prone to error (e.g., 7U may be read as 70). \n\n#### Measurement of Safety Measuring the safety of care is difficult \n\n and expensive, since adverse events are, fortunately, rare. Most hospitals rely on spontaneous reporting to identify errors and adverse events, but the sensitivity of this approach is very low, with only ~1 in 20 ADEs reported. Promising research techniques involve searching the electronic record for signals suggesting that an adverse event has occurred. These methods are not yet in wide use but will probably be used routinely in the future. Claims data have been used to identify the frequency of adverse events; this approach works much better for surgical care than for medical care and requires additional validation. The net result is that, except for a few specific types of events (e.g., falls and nosocomial infections), hospitals have little idea about the true frequency of safety issues. \n\n Nonetheless, all providers have the responsibility to report problems with safety as they are identified. All hospitals have spontaneous reporting systems, and if providers report events as they occur, those events can serve as lessons for subsequent improvement. \n\n#### Conclusions about Safety It is abundantly clear that the safety of \n\n health care can be improved substantially. As more areas are studied closely, more problems are identified. Much more is known about the epidemiology of safety in the inpatient setting than in outpatient settings. A number of effective strategies for improving inpatient safety have been identified and are increasingly being applied. Some effective strategies are also available for the outpatient setting. Transitions appear to be especially risky. The solutions to improving care often entail the consistent use of systematic techniques such as checklists and often involve leveraging of information technology. Nevertheless, solutions will also include many other domains, such human factors techniques, team training, and a culture of safety. \n\n#### ■ QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE \n\n Assessment of quality of care has remained somewhat elusive, although the tools for this purpose have increasingly improved. Selection of health care and measurement of its quality are components of a complex process. \n\n#### Quality Theory Donabedian has suggested that quality of care can \n\n be categorized by type of measurement into structure, process, and outcome. Structure refers to whether a particular characteristic is applicable in a particular setting—e.g., whether a hospital has a catheterization laboratory or whether a clinic uses an electronic health record. Process refers to the way care is delivered; examples of process measures are whether a Pap smear was performed at the recommended interval or whether an aspirin was given to a patient with a suspected myocardial infarction. Outcome refers to what happens—e.g., the mortality rate in myocardial infarction. It is important to note that good structure and process do not always result in a good outcome. For instance, a patient may present with a suspected myocardial infarction to an institution with a catheterization laboratory and receive recommended care, including aspirin, but still die because of the infarction. Quality theory also suggests that overall quality will be improved more in the aggregate if the performance level of all providers is raised rather than if a few poor performers are identified and punished. This view suggests that systems changes are especially likely to be helpful in improving quality, since large numbers of providers may be affected simultaneously. The theory of continuous quality improvement suggests that organizations should be evaluating the care they deliver on an ongoing basis and continually making small changes to improve their individual processes. This approach can be very powerful if embraced over time. Several specific tools have been developed to help improve process performance. One of the most important is the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (Fig. 8-2). This approach can be used for “rapid cycle” improvement of a process—e.g., the time that elapses between a diagnosis of pneumonia and administration of antibiotics to the patient. Some statistical tools, such as control charts, are often used in conjunction to determine whether progress is being made. Because most medical care includes one or many processes, this tool is especially important for improvement. \n\n#### Factors Relating to Quality Many factors can decrease the level \n\n of quality, including stress to providers, high or low levels of production pressure, and poor systems. Stress can have an adverse effect on quality because it can lead providers to omit important steps, as can a high level of production pressure. Low levels of production pressure sometimes can result in worse quality, as providers may be bored or have little experience with a specific problem. Poor systems can have a tremendous impact on quality, and even extremely dedicated providers typically cannot achieve high levels of performance if they are operating within a poor system. \n\n#### Data about the Current State of Quality A study published by \n\n the RAND Corporation in 2006 provided the most complete picture of \n\n---\n\n#### The Safety and Quality of Health Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 8 \n\nquality of care delivered in the United States to date. The results were sobering. The authors found that, across a wide range of quality parameters, patients in the United States received only 55% of recommended care overall; there was little variation by subtype, with scores of 54% for preventive care, 54% for acute care, and 56% for care of chronic conditions. The authors concluded that, in broad terms, the chances of getting high-quality care in the United States were little better than those of winning a coin flip. Work from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care evaluating geographic variation in use and quality of care demonstrates that, despite large variations in utilization, there is no positive correlation between the two variables at the regional level. An array of data demonstrate, however, that providers with larger volumes for specific conditions, especially for surgical conditions, do have better outcomes. \n\n#### Strategies for Improving Quality and Performance Many \n\nspecific strategies can be used to improve quality at the individual level, including rationing, education, feedback, incentives, and penalties. Rationing has been effective in some specific areas, such as persuading physicians to prescribe within a formulary, but it generally has been resisted. Education is effective in the short run and is necessary for changing opinions, but its effect decays fairly rapidly with time. Feedback on performance can be given at either the group or the individual level. Feedback is most effective if it is individualized and is given in close temporal proximity to the original events. Incentives can be effective, and many believe that they will prove to be a key to improving quality, especially if pay-for-performance with sufficient incentives is broadly implemented (see below). Penalties produce provider resentment and are rarely used in health care. Another set of strategies for improving quality involves changing the systems of care. An example would be introducing reminders about which specific actions need to be taken at a visit for a specific patient—a strategy that has been demonstrated to improve performance in certain situations, such as the delivery of preventive services. Another approach that has been effective is the development of “bundles” or groups of quality measures that can be implemented together with a high degree of fidelity. Many hospitals have implemented a bundle for ventilator-associated pneumonia in the intensive care unit that includes five measures (e.g., ensuring that the head of the bed is elevated). These hospitals have been able to improve performance substantially. Another technique is SCAMPs, or Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plans. These are care guidelines developed by clinicians who identify key steps in workflow and decisions to help improve the process outcomes. Perhaps the most pressing need is to improve the quality of care for chronic diseases. The Chronic Care Model has been developed by Wagner and colleagues **(Fig. 8-3)** ; it suggests that a combination of \n\n strategies is necessary (including self-management support, changes in delivery system design, decision support, and information systems) and that these strategies must be delivered by a practice team composed of several providers, not just a physician. Available evidence about the relative efficacy of strategies in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in outpatient diabetes care supports this general premise. It is especially notable that the outcome was the HbA1c level, as it has generally been much more difficult to improve outcome measures than process measures (such as whether HbA1c was measured). In this meta-analysis, a variety of strategies were effective, but the most effective ones were the use of team changes and the use of a case manager. When cost-effectiveness is considered in addition, it appears likely that an amalgam of strategies will be needed. However, the more expensive strategies, such as the use of case managers, probably will be implemented widely only if pay-for-performance takes hold. The evidence linking better performance on quality metrics assessing process and outcomes varies greatly by condition. For example, there is strong evidence that performing Pap smears results in better outcomes in patients who develop cervical cancer, but the evidence for many other conditions is far more tenuous. \n\n#### National State of Quality Measurement In the inpatient set\n\n ting, quality measurement is now being performed by a very large proportion of hospitals for several conditions, including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and surgical infection prevention; 20 measures are included in all. This is the result of the Hospital Quality Initiative, which represents a collaboration among many entities, including the Hospital Quality Alliance, The Joint Commission, the National Quality Forum, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The data are housed at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which publicly releases performance data on the measures on a website called Hospital Compare (www.cms.gov/ Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/HospitalQualityInits/HospitalCompare.html). These data are reported voluntarily and are available for a very high proportion of the nation’s hospitals. Analyses demonstrate substantial regional variation in quality and important differences among hospitals. Analyses by The Joint Commission for similar indicators reveal that performance on measures by hospitals has improved over time and that, as might be hoped, lower performers have improved more than higher performers. \n\n#### Public Reporting Overall, public reporting of quality data is \n\n becoming increasingly common. There are now commercial websites that have quality-related data for most regions of the United States, and \n\n#### Act \n\n#### Plan \n\n#### Do \n\n#### Check \n\nAdopt or abandon strategies based on results \n\n Identify potential improvement strategies \n\n Tr y out strategies \n\nMeasure effectiveness of strategies \n\n**FIGURE 8-2 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle.** This approach can be used to improve a specific process rapidly. First, planning is undertaken, and several potential improvement strategies are identified. Next, these strategies are evaluated in small “tests of change.” “Checking” entails measuring whether the strategies have appeared to make a difference, and “acting” refers to acting on the results. \n\n Productive interactions \n\n Informed, activated patient \n\n Prepared, proactive practice team \n\n Improved Outcomes \n\n Selfmanagement Support \n\n Delivery system design \n\n Decision support \n\n Clinical information systems \n\n Community Resources and policies \n\n Health System Organization of health care \n\n FIGURE 8-3 The Chronic Care Model, which focuses on improving care for chronic diseases, suggests that (1) delivery of high-quality care requires a range of strategies that must closely involve and engage the patient and (2) team care is essential. (From EH Wagner et al: Eff Clin Pract 1:2, 1998.) \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n Diagnosing patients’ illnesses is the essence of medicine. Patients present to doctors seeking an answer to the question, “What is wrong with me?” Ideally, no clinician would want to treat a patient without knowing the diagnosis or, worse yet, erroneously treat a misdiagnosed illness. From the earliest moments of medical school, the defining quest toward becoming a knowledgeable and proficient physician is learning how to put a diagnostic label on patients’ symptoms and physical findings, and clinicians pride themselves on being “good diagnosticians.” Yet the centuries-old paradigm of mastering a long list of diseases, understanding their pathophysiology, and knowing the cardinal ways they manifest themselves in signs and symptoms, while still of fundamental importance, is being challenged by new insights illuminated by the glaring spotlight of diagnostic errors. Basic internal medicine diseases, such as asthma, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, seizures, strokes, ruptured aneurysms, depression, and cancer, are misdiagnosed at shockingly high rates, often with 20–50% of patients either being mislabeled as having these conditions (false-positive diagnoses) or having their diagnosis missed or delayed (false negatives). How and why do physicians so often get it wrong, and what can we do to both diagnose and treat the problem of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis? Diagnosis is both an ancient art and a modern science. The current science of diagnosis, however, goes far beyond what typically comes to clinicians’ and patients’ minds when they conjure up images of stateof-the-art molecular, genetic, or imaging technologies. Improvements in diagnosis are just as likely to come from other areas, many with origins outside of medicine, as they are from advanced diagnostic testing modalities. These diverse sciences that the field of diagnostic safety has, and must, draw from include systems and human factors \n\n# 9 \n\n## Diagnosis: Reducing \n\n## Errors and Improving \n\n## Quality \n\n Gordon Schiff \n\n these data can be accessed for a fee. Similarly, national data for hospitals are available. The evidence to date indicates that patients have not made much use of such data, but that the data have had an important effect on provider and organization behavior. Instead, patients have relied on provider reputation to make choices, partly because little information was available until very recently and the information that was available was not necessarily presented in ways that were easy for patients to access. Problems still exist with quality metrics; many can be “gamed,” and even though providers are now nearly universally using electronic health records (EHRs), most metrics come from claims that include many inaccuracies. More metrics that leverage EHRs are sorely needed. However, many authorities think that, as more information about quality becomes available, it will become increasingly central to patients’ choices about where to access care. \n\n#### Pay-for-Performance Currently, providers in the United States \n\n get paid the same amount for a specific service, regardless of the quality of care delivered. The pay-for-performance theory suggests that, if providers are paid more for higher-quality care, they will invest in strategies that enable them to deliver that care. The current key issues in the pay-for-performance debate relate to (1) how effective it is, (2) what levels of incentives are needed, and (3) what perverse consequences are produced. The evidence on effectiveness is limited, although a number of studies are ongoing. With respect to incentive levels, most quality-based performance incentives have accounted for merely 1–2% of total payment in the United States to date. In the United Kingdom, however, 40% of general practitioners’ salaries have been placed at risk according to performance across a wide array of parameters; this approach has been associated with substantial improvements in reported quality performance, although it is still unclear to what extent this change represents better performance versus better reporting. The potential for perverse consequences exists with any incentive scheme. One problem is that, if incentives are tied to outcomes, there may be a tendency to transfer the sickest patients to other providers and systems. Another concern is that providers will pay too much attention to quality measures with incentives and ignore the rest of the quality picture. The validity of these concerns remains to be determined. Nonetheless, it appears likely that, under health care reform, the use of various payfor-performance schemes is likely to increase. \n\n#### ■ CONCLUSIONS \n\n The safety and quality of care in the United States could be improved substantially. A number of available interventions have been shown to improve the safety of care and should be used more widely; others are undergoing evaluation or soon will be. Quality also could be dramatically better, and the science of quality improvement continues to mature. Implementation of value-based approaches such as accountable care that include pay-for-performance related to safety and quality should make it much easier for organizations to justify investments in improving safety and quality parameters, including health information technology. However, many improvements will also require changing the structure of care—e.g., moving to a more team-oriented approach and ensuring that patients are more involved in their own care. Payment reform focusing on value seems very likely to progress and will likely include both positive incentives and penalties related to safety and quality performance. Measures of safety are still relatively immature and could be made much more robust; it would be particularly useful if organizations had measures they could use in routine operations to assess safety at a reasonable cost, and substantial research is addressing this. Although the quality measures available are more robust than those for safety, they still cover a relatively small proportion of the entire domain of quality, and more measures need to be developed. The public and payers are demanding better information about safety and quality as well as better performance in these areas. The clear implication is that these domains will have to be addressed directly by providers. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Bates DW et al: Effect of computerized physician order entry and a team intervention on prevention of serious medication errors.

Table 9-2 lists some of the common cognitive biases that can lead diagnosis astray (this topic is discussed further in Chap. 4 ). However, clinicians will also benefit from having a better understanding of diagnosis as a “system” rather than just what takes place in clinicians’ minds. Classic teaching exhorting trainees and practicing physicians to have a broad differential and “high index of suspicion” for various diseases is challenged not only by these unconscious biases but also by limitations of human memory, information shortfalls, constrained encounter time, system process failures, and the myriad nonspecific symptoms that patients bring to clinicians. Many symptoms are self-limited, defy a precise diagnosis or etiology, and do not portend harmful outcomes. Insights from safety and cognitive sciences call for rethinking traditional approaches to diagnosis and suggest new approaches to overcome current limitations (Table 9-3). \n\n#### ■ UNCERTAINTY IN DIAGNOSIS \n\n Given variations and overlap in ways patients present, illnesses evolve, and tests perform, it is often not possible or practical to “make” a definitive diagnosis, particularly in the primary care setting early in the course of a patient’s illness.

A clinician reading this chapter is likely to find this list of overlapping and intersecting domains quite daunting. However, rather than feeling overwhelmed, we urge readers to view them as the basic science supports that will ultimately make their lives easier and diagnosis more accurate and timely. Rather than feeling intimidated, clinicians should feel a sense of relief and assurance in understanding that good diagnosis does not rest entirely on their shoulders. Instead, it is a systems property, where an infrastructure and a team, one that especially includes the patient, can in a coordinated way work together to achieve more reliable and optimal diagnosis. \n\n#### ■ EMERGENCE OF DIAGNOSIS ERROR AS AN \n\n#### IMPORTANT PATIENT SAFETY ISSUE \n\nOver the past decade, a series of studies culminating in a landmark report from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM), Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, have shone a spotlight on diagnostic errors. Reports from patient surveys, malpractice claims, and safety organizations, such as the ECRI and the National Patient Safety Foundation (now part of Institute for Healthcare Improvement), have found that diagnostic errors are the leading type of medical error. Although errors in diagnosis are defined in various ways, the NAM Committee defined diagnostic error as “the failure to (a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient’s health problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the patient.” One way to visualize diagnostic errors is through a Venn diagram **(Fig. 9-1)** , which illustrates the fact that many things can go wrong in the diagnostic process (e.g., failure to ask an important history question, physical examination sign overlooked, laboratory specimen erroneously switched between two patients, x-ray not followed up), but this usually does not result in a wrong diagnosis or patient harm. Similarly, a patient can be misdiagnosed but unharmed, without any identifiable error in the care received. Our greatest concern is where these three circles intersect, with conservative estimates suggesting that 40,000–80,000 patients die each year in U.S. hospitals alone from diagnostic errors. The NAM report outlined eight recommendations that are the foundation for this chapter **(Table 9-1)**. \n\n#### ■ NEW WAYS TO THINK ABOUT DIAGNOSIS AND \n\n#### DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS \n\nMedical textbooks have historically given attention to “clinician reasoning” and associated cognitive heuristics and biases. Errors in clinical reasoning can be summarized in three broad groups: (1) hasty judgments, (2) biased judgments, and (3) inaccurate probability estimates. Research from cognitive psychology has identified scores of common mental shortcuts or “heuristics” humans are prone to use in everyday life, many of which are useful for efficient diagnosis but \n\n TABLE 9-2 Selected Cognitive Biases Contributing to Diagnostic Errors \n\n1. Premature closure: accepting a diagnosis before it has been fully verified \n\n2. Anchoring: tendency to fixate on a specific symptom or piece of information     early in the diagnostic process with subsequent failure to appropriately     adjust \n\n3. Confirmation bias: tendency to look for confirming evidence to support one’s     diagnostic hypothesis, rather than disconfirming evidence to refute it \n\n4. Search satisficing: tendency to call off a search, satisfied once a piece of     data or presumed explanation is found, and not considering/searching for     additional findings or diagnoses \n\n5. Availability bias: tendency to give too much weight to diagnoses that come     more readily to mind (e.g., recent dramatic case) \n\n6. Base-rate neglect: failing to adequately take into account prevalence of a     particular disease (e.g., erroneously interpreting a positive test as indicating     disease in a low-prevalence population using a test with 5% false-positive     rate) \n\n7. Knowledge deficit (on part of provider, with accompanying lack of     awareness) \n\n8. Framing bias: Judgement overly influenced by the way the problem was     presented (how it was framed in words, settings, situations) \n\n9. Social/demographic/stereotype bias: biases from personal or cultural beliefs     about women, minorities, or other patient groups for whom prejudices may     distort diagnostic assessment \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n TABLE 9-3 New Models for Conceptualizing Diagnosis and Diagnosis Improvement TRADITIONAL WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT DIAGNOSIS AND DIAGNOSTIC ERROR NEW PARADIGMS/BETTER WAYS TO THINK ABOUT DIAGNOSIS AND IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS General A good diagnostician gets it right the first time, almost all of the time \n\n Diagnosis is an inexact science with inherent uncertainties Goal is to minimize errors and delays via more reliable systems and follow-up Lore of masterful/skillful academic expert diagnostician who knows/recalls everything;

Terms such as preliminary diagnosis, working diagnosis, differential diagnosis, deferred diagnosis, undiagnosed illness, diagnoses with uncertain or multifactorial etiologies, intermittent diagnoses, multiple/dual diagnoses, self-diagnosis, or at times contested diagnosis need to be part of our vocabulary, thinking, and communications with patients to convey that diagnosis is often imprecise. Anxious patients worried about a condition, for example, cancer, COVID-19 infection, or a diagnosis to which a relative or a friend has recently succumbed, come seeking reassurance and may not welcome an uncertain answer. Thus, we have to work with patients, listen to and respect their concerns, and take their symptoms seriously yet modestly acknowledge our limitations. We need to tailor this approach to patients’ differing levels of health literacy, trust in our clinical advice, and experiences with the health system. \n\n#### ■ DON’T MISS DIAGNOSES AND RED FLAGS \n\nUncertainty should not be a license for complacency. Particularly for diseases that (1) progress rapidly, (2) require specific treatments that depend on making the correct diagnosis, or (3) have public health or contagion implications, clinicians need to be poised, and systems designed, to consider and, where appropriate, pursue critical “don’t miss” diagnoses. While clinicians are generally aware of more common “don’t miss” diagnoses (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, sepsis), **Table 9-4** illustrates examples of less common diagnoses that warrant similar consideration. Throughout this textbook, readers should orient themselves to recognize such critical diagnoses and think about presentations and syndromes where they may be lurking. An important related concept is so-called “red flags” or “alarm symptoms.” This construct has its origins in guidelines for back pain but has increasingly been applied to many other problems, such as headache, red eye, swollen joint, or even abdominal pain and chest pain. Examples of widely cited red flags for back pain that should trigger consideration of more serious etiologies include fever, weight loss, history of malignancy or intravenous drug use, or neurologic signs and symptoms. In theory, many presenting syndromes could benefit from identification of such clues to more serious diagnoses. Evidence-based medicine calls for better data on the sensitivity, specificity, yield, and discriminatory ability of various clinical “red flag” clues; yet, few have been rigorously evaluated. Nonetheless, clinicians find them useful as simple ways to reassure themselves and their patients that a common symptom such as back pain or headache is, or is not, likely an indicator of more urgent or serious pathology. Interwoven with the challenges of not missing critical diagnoses is the problem of overtesting and overdiagnosis—performing unnecessary and even potentially harmful tests whose benefit does not justify the risks or costs or that may lead to diagnoses that would have never \n\n caused any symptoms or problems. Thoughtful diagnosticians need to weigh carefully this “other side of the coin” of missed diagnosis to avoid such harms and expenses. \n\n#### ■ DIAGNOSTIC PITFALLS \n\n One of the important ways of learning in medicine is learning from the missteps of those who have walked the path ahead of us. By learning about commonly missed diagnoses and the ways accurate, timely diagnosis went astray, we can avoid making similar mistakes. Anticipating the potential for similar types of errors can both create situational awareness of traps to avoid and contribute to learning from our own personal and collective patterns of mistakes. Several studies have examined common or recurring pitfalls in diagnosis. An example of a common disease-specific diagnostic pitfall in breast cancer diagnosis is ordering a mammogram for a woman with a palpable breast lump and, when the mammogram returns as normal, reassuring her that cancer has been “ruled out” by the negative test. Any mass or lesion palpable \n\n (Continued) \n\n TABLE 9-4 Examples of “Don’t Miss” Diagnoses \n\n INFECTIONS/ INFLAMMATION \n\n CARDIAC/ISCHEMIC/ BLEEDING \n\n METABOLIC/ HEMATOLOGIC/ ENVIRONMENTAL Spinal epidural abscess Aortic dissection Leaking/ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm \n\n Diabetes ketoacidosis Hyperosmolar hyperglycemia \n\n Necrotizing fasciitis Pericardial tamponade Myxedema/ thyrotoxicosis Meningitis Wolff-Parkinson-White Prolonged QT \n\n Addison’s disease \n\n Endocarditis Pulmonary embolism B 12 deficiency anemia Peritonsillar abscess Tension pneumothorax von Willebrand’s disease Tuberculosis-active pulmonary, other \n\n Acute mesenteric ischemia Sigmoid volvulus \n\n Hemochromatosis \n\n COVID-19 infection Esophageal, bowel perforation \n\n Celiac sprue \n\n Guillain-Barré syndrome Cerebellar hemorrhage Carbon monoxide poisoning Ebola infection Spinal cord compression Food poisoning Temporal arteritis Testicular, ovarian torsion Malignant hyperthermia Rhabdomyolysis Ectopic pregnancy Alcohol, benzodiazepine, barbiturate withdrawal Angioedema Retroperitoneal hemorrhage \n\n Tumor lysis syndrome Hypo-/hypercalcemia \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n on physical examination probably needs more careful assessment proceeding all the way to invasive biopsy, if necessary. Diagnostic pitfalls can be classified into a number of generic scenarios (Table 9-5). We now have large databases that have the potential to track “diagnoses outcomes”—i.e., whether a new diagnosis emerges that suggests an initial diagnosis was incorrect or a diagnosis of a patient’s symptoms was suboptimally delayed. This should, in the future, allow us to more rigorously focus on these cases, to identify contributing factors and recurring patterns, and to help point the way for systemwide improvement strategies. \n\n#### ■ DIAGNOSIS SAFETY CULTURE \n\n Just as diagnosing bacterial infections relies on a proper culture medium to grow and identify etiologic organisms, good diagnosis also requires a healthy safety culture that will allow it to grow and flourish. While clinicians may be inclined to view “safety culture” as something too subjective to be important in their quest to make a definitive diagnosis, this view is misguided. Multiple studies have demonstrated adverse consequences resulting from organizational cultures that inhibit openness, learning, and sharing and create a climate where staff \n\n and patients are afraid to speak up when they observe problems or have questions. Most importantly, patients need to be encouraged to question diagnoses and be heard, particularly when they are not responding to treatment as expected or developing symptoms that are either not consistent with the diagnosis or represent possible red flags for other diagnoses or complications. Studies examining “high-reliability organizations” outside of medicine and “learning health care organizations” have distilled a series of fundamental properties that are correlated with more reliable and safer outcomes. Just as a thermometer or recording of a pulse can suggest how ill a patient is, we now have instruments that can measure safety culture. These safety measurement tools typically are validated staff surveys that assess (1) communication about errors with staff willingness to report mistakes because they do not feel these mistakes are held against them; (2) openness and encouragement to talk about hospital/office problems; (3) existence of a learning culture that seeks to learn from errors and improve based on lessons learned; (4) leadership commitment to safety, prioritizing safety over production speed and the “bottom line” by providing adequate staffing and resources to operate safely; and (5) accountability and transparency for following up safety events and concerns. Each of these generic culture attributes translates into specific implications for diagnostic safety. These include the following: \n\n- Making it “safe” for clinicians to admit and share diagnostic errors \n\n- Proactive identification, ownership, and accountability regarding     error-prone diagnostic workflow processes (particularly around test     results, referrals, and patient follow-up) \n\n- Leadership making diagnosis improvement a top priority based on     recognition that patients and malpractice insurers report that diag-     nostic errors are the leading patient safety problem \n\n- Mutual trust and respect for challenges that clinicians often face in     making diagnoses and caution in applying the lens of hindsight bias     in judging what in retrospect might seem like an “obvious” diagnosis     that a clinician initially missed \n\n#### ■ HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE \n\n#### FUTURE OF DIAGNOSIS \n\n Clinicians now spend more time interacting with computers than they do interacting with patients. This is especially true for diagnosis and will likely be even more so in the future. Interactions with patients, consultants, and other staff are increasingly mediated through the computer. Key activities, such as collecting patients’ history (past and current), interpreting data to make a diagnosis, conveying diagnostic assessments (to others on the team and, increasingly, to the patient via open notes), and tracking diagnostic trajectories as they evolve over time, are now computer based. With the rise of telemedicine, even elements of the physical examination have been rerouted to electronic encounters. While many complain the computer has “gotten in the way” of good diagnosis, distracting clinicians from quality time listening to patients and miring doctors in reading and writing notes filled with copied/ pasted/templated information of questionable currency and accuracy, medicine needs to harness the computer’s capabilities to improve diagnosis (Table 9-6). Although these basic diagnosis-supporting capabilities should be the foundation of the design of health information technology and everyday workflow, electronic medical records have historically been largely designed around other needs, such as ordering medications and billing and malpractice documentation. They need to be radically redesigned to better support diagnostic processes, as well as save, rather than squander, clinicians’ time. \n\n#### ■ DIAGNOSIS OF DIAGNOSIS ERRORS AND SAFETY: \n\n#### PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS \n\n In practice, there are frequent and meaningful opportunities for improving diagnosis in each of the three NAM-defined areas to make it a) more reliable, b) timely, and c) to improve diagnosis-related communication with patients. Clinicians in training, practicing physicians, nurses, and others should develop the habit of regularly asking \n\n TABLE 9-5 Generic Types of Diagnostic Pitfalls PITFALL EXAMPLES Disease A mistaken for disease B Diseases often mistaken/misdiagnosed with each other \n\n *\tAortic dissection misdiagnosed as acute myocardial infarction *\tBipolar disorder misdiagnosed as depression Misinterpretation of test result(s) False-positive or false-negative results with failure to recognize test limitations \n\n *\tBreast lump dismissed after negative mammogram *\tNegative COVID-19 test early or late in course Failure to recognize atypical presentation, signs, and symptoms \n\n *\tApathetic hyperthyroidism *\tSepsis in elderly patient who is afebrile or hypothermic Failure to assess appropriately the urgency of diagnosis Urgency of the clinical situation was not appreciated and/or delays critical diagnoses \n\n *\tCompartment syndrome *\tPericardial tamponade *\tTension pneumothorax \n\n Perils of intermittent symptoms or misleading evolution Intermittent symptoms dismissed due to normal findings (exam, lab, electrocardiogram) when initially seen \n\n *\t“Lucid interval” in traumatic epidural hematoma *\tParoxysmal arrhythmias *\tIntermittent hydrocephalus (Bruns’ syndrome) Confusion arising from response/ masking by empiric treatment \n\n *\tEmpiric treatment with steroids, proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, pain medication erroneously masking serious diagnosis Chronic disease or comorbidity presumed to account for new symptoms Especially in medically complex patients \n\n *\tSeptic joint signs misattributed to chronic rheumatoid arthritis *\tMental status change due to infection or medication misattributed to underlying dementia Rare diagnosis: failure to consider or know \n\n *\tMany; fortunately, by definition, rare, but still warrant consideration especially if urgent or treatable Drug or environmental factor not considered/overlooked Underlying etiology causing/ contributing to symptoms, or disease progression not sought, uncovered \n\n *\tVentricular arrhythmia related to QT-prolonging drug *\tAchilles tendon rupture related to quinolone drugs \n\n Failure to appreciate risk factors for particular disease \n\n *\tFamily history of breast, colorectal cancer not solicited and/or weighed in diagnostic evaluation or screening Failure to appreciate limitations of physical exam Now with ↑ telemedicine, missing physical exam entirely \n\n *\tOverweighing absence of tenderness, swelling in deep vein thrombosis *\tMissing pill-rolling tremor during telemedicine visit \n\n---\n\n#### Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 10 \n\n TABLE 9-6 Areas Where Health Information Technology Has Potential to Help Improve Diagnosis and Reduce Errors FUNCTION EXAMPLES Facilitate collection/ gathering of information \n\n *\tQuickly access past history from prior care at same and outside institutions *\tElectronic collection of history of present illness, review of systems, and social determinant risks in advance of visits Enhanced information entry, organization, and display \n\n *\tVisually enhanced flowsheets showing trends, relationships to treatment *\tReorganized notes to facilitate summarization and simplification and prevent items from getting lost Generating differential diagnosis \n\n *\tAutomated creation of lists of diagnoses to consider based on patient’s symptoms, demographics, risks Weighing diagnoses likelihoods \n\n *\tTools to assist in calculation of posttest (Bayesian) probabilities Aids for formulating diagnostic plan, intelligent test ordering \n\n *\tEntering a diagnostic consideration (e.g., celiac disease, pheochromocytoma) and computer suggests most appropriate diagnostic test(s) and how to order Access to diagnostic reference information \n\n *\tInfo-buttons instantly linking symptom or diagnosis relevant questions to Harrison’s, Up-to-Date chapters, references Ensuring more reliable follow-up \n\n *\tHardwiring “closed loops” to ensure abnormal labs, missed referrals, worrisome symptoms are tracked and followed up Support screening for early detection \n\n *\tCollaborative tools that patients, clinicians, and offices can use to know when due, order and track screening based on individualized demographics, risk factors, prior tests Collaborative diagnosis; access to specialist \n\n *\tReal-time posing/answering of questions *\tElectronic consults; virtual co-management Facilitating feedback on diagnoses \n\n *\tFeeding back new diagnoses (from downstream providers, patients) that emerge suggesting potential misdiagnosis/errors to clinicians, ERs who saw patient previously \n\nAbbreviation: ERs, emergency rooms.

Ann Intern Med 169:643, 2018. \n\nthemselves three questions about individual patients in their care, and another three questions regarding the systems in which they work. For each patient being assessed, clinicians should ask: \n\n1. What else might this be? (forcing a differential diagnosis to be made) \n\n2. What doesn’t fit? (making sure unexplained abnormal findings are     not dismissed) \n\n3. What critical diagnoses are important not to miss? (injecting con-     sideration of “don’t miss” diagnoses, red flags, and known pitfalls) \n\nand to diagnose safely, each practitioner must recognize that he or she is working within a larger system. Questions to be asking continually, ensuring we are maximizing reliability and timeliness and minimizing potential for errors, include: \n\n1. Do we have reliable “closed loop” systems to provide reliable, ideally     automated tracking and following up of patients’ symptoms, abnormal     laboratory or imaging findings, and critical referrals that we order? \n\n2. What is the culture-of-safety climate in our organization, office, or     clinic? \n\n3. How does the electronic (or even paper) medical record as currently     implemented help versus impair efficient, timely, accurate, and fail-     safe diagnosis, and how can it be improved?     To take these questions to the next stage, an international move- ment dedicated to studying and improving diagnosis has emerged. These efforts include annual conferences of clinicians, researchers, and patients; the formation of the Society for Improving Diagnosis in Medicine (SIDM); and convening of a broad coalition of organizations, \n\n Over the course of its history, the United States has experienced dramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy, largely as a result of initiatives in public health, health promotion, disease prevention, and chronic care management. Our ability to prevent, detect, and treat diseases in their early stages has allowed us to target and reduce rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite interventions that have improved the overall health of the majority of Americans, racial and ethnic minorities (blacks, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans/ Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders) have benefited less from these advances than whites and have suffered poorer health outcomes from many major diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These disparities highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing the multiple factors that impact health outcomes, including structural racism, social determinants of health (SDOH), access to care, and health care quality. On this last point, research has revealed that minorities may receive less care and lower-quality care than whites, even when confounders such as stage of presentation, comorbidities, and health insurance are controlled. These differences in quality are called racial and ethnic disparities in health care. These health care disparities have taken on greater importance with the significant transformation of the U.S. health care system and value-based purchasing. The shift toward creating financial incentives and disincentives to achieve quality goals makes focusing on those who receive lower-quality care more important than ever before. This chapter will provide an overview of racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care, identify root causes, and provide key recommendations to address these disparities at both the clinical and health system levels. \n\n#### ■ NATURE AND EXTENT OF DISPARITIES \n\n Life expectancy at birth is an important measure of the health of a nation’s population. Although the overall life expectancy in the United States has been increasing since 1900, differences due to \n\n# 10 \n\n## Racial and Ethnic \n\n## Disparities in Health Care \n\n Lenny López, Joseph R. Betancourt \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n race/ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status have persisted. For example, at every level of education and income, African Americans have lower life expectancy at age 25 than whites and Hispanics/Latinos. Blacks with a college degree or more education have lower life expectancy than whites and Hispanics who graduated from high school. Blacks have had lower life expectancy compared to whites for as long as data have been collected. From 1975 to 2003, the largest difference in life expectancy between blacks and whites was substantial (6.3 years for males and 4.5 years for females) (Fig. 10-1). The gap in life expectancy between the black and white populations decreased by 2.3 years between 1999 and 2013 from 5.9 to 3.6 years (4.4 years for males and 3.0 years for women) (Fig. 10-2). The life expectancy gap is augmented by worse health and higher disease burden. Cardiovascular-related diseases remain the leading cause of black-white differences in life expectancy. If all cardiovascular causes and diabetes are considered together, they account for 35% and 52% of the gap for males and females, respectively. Finally, place matters for health. Analysis of data from 2010 to 2015 demonstrate large geographic life expectancy gap variation at the census tract level (Fig. 10-3). Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors (prevalence of obesity, leisure-time physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes), and health care factors (percentage of the population younger than 65 years who are insured, primary care access and quality, number of physicians per capita) explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors. In addition to racial and ethnic disparities in health, there are racial and ethnic disparities in the quality of care for persons with access to \n\n White females \n\n Life expectancy (years) 60 \n\n 70 \n\n 1985 1995 2005 \n\n 80 \n\n 65 \n\n 75 \n\n 85 \n\n Black females \n\n 1985 1995 2005 Year \n\n White males \n\n 1985 1995 2005 \n\n Black males \n\n 1985 1995 2005 \n\n FIGURE 10-1 Life expectancy at birth among black and white males and females in the United States, 1975–2003.

For instance, studies have documented disparities in the treatment of pneumonia and congestive heart failure, with blacks receiving less optimal care than whites when hospitalized for these conditions. Moreover, blacks with endstage renal disease are referred less often to the transplant list than are their white counterparts (Fig. 10-4). Disparities have been found, for example, in the use of cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (with blacks being referred less often than whites for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting), prescription of analgesia for pain control (with blacks and Hispanics/Latinos receiving less pain medication than whites for long-bone fractures and cancer), and surgical treatment of lung cancer (with blacks receiving less curative surgery than whites for non-small-cell lung cancer). Again, many of these disparities have occurred even when variations in factors such as insurance status, income, age, comorbid conditions, and symptom expression are taken into account. Finally, disparities in the quality of care provided at the sites where minorities tend to receive care have been shown to be an important additional contributor to overall disparities. The 2019 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report, released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, tracks about 250 health care process, outcome, and access measures, across many diseases and settings. This annual report is particularly important because most studies of disparities have not been longitudinally repeated with the same methodology to document trends and changes in disparities over time. This report found that some disparities were getting smaller from 2000 through 2016–2018, but disparities persisted and some even worsened, especially for poor and uninsured populations. For about 40% of quality measures, blacks (82 of 202 measures) and American Indians and Alaska Natives (47 of 116 measures) received worse care than whites. For more than onethird of quality measures, Hispanics (61 of 177 measures) received worse care than whites. Asians and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders received worse care than whites for about 30% of quality measures, but Asians also received better care for about 30% of quality measures (Fig. 10-5). Of note, for those quality measures that demonstrated disparities at baseline, \u003e90% of these measures showed no improvement since 2000 (Fig. 10-6). \n\n#### ■ ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITIES \n\n#### Race, Racism, and Health Race and racism are core elements of any \n\n explanatory model on racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. Our nation’s history of slavery, segregation, separate but “equal” health care, and medical experimentation, among a myriad of other ways in which racism has manifested in the United States, has played a key role in the existence and persistence of these disparities. It is now well accepted that race is a social category without biologic foundation and a product of historical racism. Nevertheless, it is clear that racism has a biologic impact as a form of psychosocial stress. It is now well established \n\n---\n\n#### Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 10 \n\n Life Expectancy at birth (Quintiles) \n\n Geographic areas with no data available are filled in gray \n\n 56.9–75.1 75.2–77.5 77.6–79.5 79.6–81.6 81.7–97.5 \n\n**FIGURE 10-3 Life expectancy at birth for U.S. census tracts, 2010-2015.** (A New View of Life Expectancy, Surveillance and Data Blogs and Stories, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This accelerated disease risk, aging, and premature death has been termed the weathering effect. While most empiric research focuses on interpersonal racial/ ethnic discrimination, structural racism (sometimes called institutional racism) provides a more holistic framework. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways that a society fosters, sustains, and reinforces discrimination through sociopolitical, legal, economic, and health structures that determine differential access to risks, opportunities, and resources that drive health and health care disparities. Structural racism explains how racism’s structure and ideology can persist in governmental and institutional policies in the absence of individual actors who are explicitly racially prejudiced. For example, the history of residential segregation has had lasting negative effects generationally on equal access for racial/ ethnic minorities to employment, banking, earnings, high-quality education, and health care. Policies that do not address root structural causes will not address health and health care inequities. With the promise of individualizing clinical decisions, the use of race in clinical and risk assessment algorithms has long been a part of modern medicine. The evidence is now clear that race is not a reliable proxy for genetic difference and that race adjustment has the potential to create inadvertent disparities in health care. One clinical example is from nephrology. Blacks have higher rates of end-stage kidney disease and death due to kidney failure than the overall population. The most widely used cohort-derived equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, has the limitation that it produces 80–90% estimated GFR (eGFR) values that are within ±30% of a patient’s measured GFR. In addition, this equation uses a black race-related factor, which increases eGFR for any given serum creatinine by 15.9% compared to a nonblack patient with the same age, sex, and serum creatinine. The increase in eGFR is likely to disadvantage blacks for early referral to a nephrologist, early treatment of advanced chronic kidney disease, and \n\nthat psychosocial stress negatively impacts health through psychophysiologic reactivity causing hyperstimulation of the sympathetic-adrenalmedullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and neurohormonal dysregulation causing an acceleration of cardiovascular disease.

It is also not clear how to apply the race factor when the patient’s race is unknown and/or ambiguous, as in those who are multiracial. This disparity-inducing scenario could be avoided through the use of cystatin C–based eGFR estimation, which has been demonstrated to be more accurate than the CKD-EPI equation and for which race is not required in estimation. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) analytics to large amounts of clinical electronic data—big data—holds the promise to better understand health care costs, utilization, resource allocation, and population health monitoring. Machine learning models can identify the statistical patterns in large amounts of historically collected data. These data naturally contain the patterning of preexisting health care disparities created by socially and historically structured inequities. This biased patterning can lead to incorrect predictions, withholding of resources, and worse outcomes for vulnerable populations. Recently, analysis of a commercial, national, proprietary prediction algorithm, affecting millions of patients, exhibited racial bias. Historical cost data were used to predict clinical risk and allocate additional clinical services for highcost patients. Algorithmic bias arose because black patients historically have less access to health care and thus less money is spent on their care compared to white patients. Thus, blacks, who tended to be sicker than white patients, received lower clinical risk scores and thus were less likely to receive additional clinical services. The observed allocation bias was remedied using direct measures of illness and illness severity. Thus, machine learning algorithms are not inherently free of bias and should be assessed for accuracy and fairness. In summary, there are many ways in which racism has contributed and does and will continue to contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care. \n\n#### ■ SOCIAL DETERMINANTS \n\n#### OF HEALTH \n\n Minority Americans have poorer health outcomes than whites from preventable and treatable conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Multiple factors contribute to these racial and ethnic disparities in health. The landmark \n\n National Academy of Medicine (formerly, the Institute of Medicine [IOM]) report, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, published in 2002, summarized the scientific evidence on health disparities and provided an important framework for conceptualizing and defining racial/ ethnic disparities. Since the Unequal Treatment report, there has been a growing empiric evidence base on how racism and the SDOH, often working in synergy, create and sustain disparities. Mechanistically, the biopsychosocial model brings together the social and physical characteristics of the environment with individual physical and psychological attributes. These environmental and individual characteristics, in turn, influence health behaviors and stress-related physiologic pathways that directly impact health. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities SDOH model builds on prior models and adds the time element across the life course of the individual in recognition of the long-lasting health effects of socioeconomic exposures (Fig. 10-7). The resulting matrix has the domains of influence of health (biological, behavioral, physical and built environment, sociocultural environment, health care system) along the y-axis and the levels of influence on health (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) along the x-axis. Cells are not mutually exclusive, and examples of factors within each cell are illustrative and not comprehensive. This framework emphasizes the complex multidomain etiologies of disparities across the factors in the conceptual matrix thus highlighting the limitation of individual-level focused research and policy. In addition to race and racism, Unequal Treatment identified a set of root causes that included health system, provider-level, and patientlevel factors. \n\n#### Health System Factors * HEALTH SYSTEM COMPLEXITY Even \n\n among persons who are insured and educated and who have a high degree of health literacy, navigating the U.S. health care system can be complicated and confusing. Some individuals may be at higher risk for receiving substandard care because of their difficulty navigating the system’s complexities. These individuals may include those from cultures \n\n---\n\n#### Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 10 \n\nunfamiliar with the Western model of health care delivery, those with limited English proficiency, those with low health literacy, and those who are mistrustful of the health care system. These individuals may have difficulty knowing how and where to go for a referral to a specialist; how to prepare for a procedure such as a colonoscopy; or how to follow up on an abnormal test result such as a mammogram. Since people of color in the United States tend to be overrepresented among the groups listed above, the inherent complexity of navigating the health care system has been seen as a root cause for racial/ethnic disparities in health care. \n\n**OTHER HEALTH SYSTEM FACTORS** Racial/ethnic disparities are due not only to differences in care provided within hospitals but also to where and from whom minorities receive their care; i.e., certain specific providers, geographic regions, or hospitals are lower-performing on certain aspects of quality. For example, one study showed that 25% of hospitals cared for 90% of black Medicare patients in the United States and that these hospitals tended to have lower performance scores on certain quality measures than other hospitals. That said, health systems generally are not well prepared to measure, report, and intervene to reduce disparities in care. Few hospitals or health plans stratify their quality data by race/ethnicity or language to measure disparities, and even fewer use data of this type to develop disparity-targeted interventions. Similarly, despite regulations concerning the need for professional interpreters, research demonstrates that many health care organizations and providers fail to routinely provide this service for patients with limited English proficiency. Despite the link between limited English proficiency and health care quality and safety, few providers or institutions monitor performance for patients in these areas. \n\n#### Provider-Level Factors * PROVIDER–PATIENT COMMUNICATION \n\nSignificant evidence highlights the impact of sociocultural factors, race, ethnicity, and limited English proficiency on health and clinical care. Health care professionals frequently care for diverse populations with varied perspectives, values, beliefs, and behaviors regarding health and well-being. The differences include variations in the recognition of symptoms, thresholds for seeking care, comprehension of management strategies, expectations of care (including preferences for or against diagnostic and therapeutic procedures), and adherence to preventive \n\n measures and medications. In addition, sociocultural differences between patient and provider influence communication and clinical decision-making and are especially pertinent: evidence clearly links provider–patient communication to improved patient satisfaction, regimen adherence, and better health outcomes (Fig. 10-8). Thus, when sociocultural differences between patient and provider are not appreciated, explored, understood, or communicated effectively during the medical encounter, patient dissatisfaction, poor adherence, poorer health outcomes, and racial/ethnic disparities in care may result. A survey of 6722 Americans ≥18 years of age is particularly relevant to this important link between provider–patient communication and health outcomes. Whites, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans who had made a medical visit in the past 2 years were asked whether they had trouble understanding their doctors; whether they felt the doctors did not listen; and whether they had medical questions they were afraid to ask. The survey found that 19% of all patients experienced one or more of these problems, yet whites experienced them 16% of the time as opposed to 23% of the time for African Americans, 33% for Hispanics/Latinos, and 27% for Asian Americans (Fig. 10-9). \n\n Biological \n\n Behavioral \n\n Physical/Built Environment \n\n Sociocultural Environment \n\n Health Care System \n\n Health Outcomes Individual Health \n\n Individual Interpersonal \n\n Levels of Influence* \n\n Domains of Influence (Over the Lifecourse) \n\n Community Societal \n\n Community Health \n\n Population Health \n\n Family/ Organizational Health \n\n Biological Vulnerability and Mechanisms \n\n Caregiver–Child Interaction Family Microbiome \n\n Community Illness Exposure Herd Immunity \n\n Sanitation Immunization Pathogen Exposure \n\n Policies and Laws \n\n Societal Structure \n\n Community Functioning \n\n Community Environment Community Resources \n\n Community Norms Local Structural Discrimination \n\n Social Norms Societal Structural Discrimination \n\n Quality of Care Health Care Policies \n\n Availability of Services Safety Net Services \n\n Family Functioning School/Work Functioning \n\n Household Environment School/Work Environment \n\n Social Networks Family/Peer Norms Interpersonal Discrimination \n\n Patient–Clinician Relationship Medical Decision-Making \n\n Health Behaviors Coping Strategies \n\n Personal Environment \n\n Sociodemographics Limited English Cultural Identity Response to Discrimination \n\n Insurance Coverage Health Literacy Tr eatment Preferences \n\n**FIGURE 10-7 National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities social determinants research framework.** *Health disparity populations: race/ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, rural, sexual and gender minority.

These communication barriers for patients with limited English proficiency lead to frequent misunderstanding of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up plans; inappropriate use of medications; lack of informed consent for surgical procedures; high rates of adverse events with more serious clinical consequences; and a lower-quality health care experience than is provided to patients who speak fluent English. Physicians who have access to trained interpreters report a significantly higher quality of patient–physician communication than physicians who use other methods. Communication issues related to discordant language disproportionately affect minorities and likely contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care. CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING Theory and research suggest that variations in clinical decision-making may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. Two factors are central to this process: clinical uncertainty and stereotyping. First, a doctor’s decision-making process is nested in clinical uncertainty. Doctors depend on inferences about severity based on what they understand about illness and the information obtained from the patient. A doctor caring for a patient whose symptoms he or she has difficulty understanding and whose “signals”—the set of clues and indications that physicians rely on to make clinical decisions—are hard to read may make a decision different from the one that would be made for another patient who presents with exactly the same clinical condition. Given that the expression of symptoms may differ among cultural and racial groups, doctors—the overwhelming majority of whom are white—may understand symptoms best when expressed by patients of their own racial/ethnic groups. The consequence is that white patients may be treated differently from minority patients. Differences in clinical decisions can arise from this mechanism even when the doctor has the same regard for each patient (i.e., is not prejudiced). Second, the literature on social cognitive theory highlights how natural tendencies to stereotype may influence clinical decision-making. Stereotyping can be defined as the way in which people use social categories (e.g., race, gender, age) in acquiring, processing, and recalling information about others. Faced with enormous information loads and the need to make many decisions, people often subconsciously simplify the decision-making process and lessen cognitive effort by using “categories” or “stereotypes” that bundle information into groups or \n\n types that can be processed more quickly. Although functional, stereotyping can be systematically biased, as people are automatically classified into social categories based on dimensions such as race, gender, and age. Many people may not be aware of their attitudes, may not consciously endorse specific stereotypes, and paradoxically may consider themselves egalitarian and not prejudiced. Stereotypes may be strongly influenced by the messages presented consciously and unconsciously in society. For instance, if the media and our social/professional contacts tend to present images of minorities as being less educated, more violent, and nonadherent to health care recommendations, these impressions may generate stereotypes that unnaturally and unjustly impact clinical decision-making. As signs of racism, classism, gender bias, and ageism are experienced (consciously or unconsciously) in our society, stereotypes may be created that impact the way doctors manage patients from these groups. On the basis of training or practice location, doctors may develop certain perceptions about race/ethnicity, culture, and class that may evolve into stereotypes. For example, many medical students and residents are trained—and minorities cared for—in academic health centers or public hospitals located in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. As a result, doctors may begin to equate certain races and ethnicities with specific health beliefs and behaviors (e.g., “these patients” engage in risky behaviors, “those patients” tend to be noncompliant) that are more associated with the social environment (e.g., poverty) than with a patient’s racial/ethnic background or cultural traditions. This “conditioning” phenomenon may also be operative if doctors are faced with certain racial/ethnic patient groups who frequently do not choose aggressive forms of diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. The result over time may be that doctors begin to believe that “these patients” do not like invasive procedures; thus, they may not offer these procedures as options. A wide range of studies have documented the potential for provider biases to contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care. For example, one study measured physicians’ unconscious (or implicit) biases and showed that these were related to differences in decisions to provide thrombolysis for a hypothetical black or white patient with a myocardial infarction. It is important to differentiate stereotyping from prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice is a conscious prejudgment of individuals that may lead to disparate treatment, and discrimination is conscious and intentional disparate treatment. All individuals stereotype subconsciously, yet, if left unquestioned, these subconscious assumptions may lead to lower-quality care for certain groups because of differences in clinical decision-making or differences in communication and patientcenteredness. For example, one study tested physicians’ unconscious racial/ethnic biases and showed that patients perceived more biased physicians as being less patient-centered in their communication. What is particularly salient is that stereotypes tend to be activated most in environments where the individual is stressed, multitasking, and under time pressure—the hallmarks of the clinical encounter. In fact, in a survey of close to 16,000 physicians, 42% admitted that bias— including by race and ethnicity—impacted their clinical decisionmaking. Interestingly, emergency medicine physicians, who work in environments of stress, time pressure, risk, and where they are multitasking, topped the list by discipline at 62%. \n\n#### Patient-Level Factors Lack of trust has become a major concern \n\n for many health care institutions today. For example, an IOM report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, documented alarming rates of medical errors that made patients feel vulnerable and less trustful of the U.S. health care system. The increased media and academic attention to problems related to quality of care (and of disparities themselves) has clearly diminished trust in doctors and nurses. Trust is a crucial element in the therapeutic alliance between patient and health care provider. It facilitates open communication and is directly correlated with adherence to the physician’s recommendations and the patient’s satisfaction. In other words, patients who mistrust their health care providers are less satisfied with the care they receive, and mistrust of the health care system greatly affects patients’ use of services. Mistrust can also result in inconsistent care, “doctor-shopping,” \n\n 0 \n\n 20 \n\n 40 \n\n To talWhite African American \n\n Hispanic Asian American \n\n 19% 16% \n\n 23% \n\n 33% \n\n 27% \n\n Percent of adults with one or more communication problems* \n\n Base: Adults with health care visit in past two years *Problems include understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, had questions but did not ask. \n\n FIGURE 10-9 Communication difficulties with physicians, by race/ethnicity.

On the basis of historic factors such as discrimination, segregation, and medical experimentation, blacks may be especially mistrustful of providers. The exploitation of blacks by the U.S. Public Health Service during the Tuskegee syphilis study from 1932 to 1972 left a legacy of mistrust that persists even today among this population. Other populations, including Native Americans/Alaskan Natives, Hispanics/ Latinos, and Asian Americans, also harbor significant mistrust of the health care system. A national survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that there is significant mistrust for the health care system among minority populations. Of the 3884 individuals surveyed, 36% of Hispanics and 35% of blacks (compared to 15% of whites) felt they were treated unfairly in the health care system in the past based on their race and ethnicity. Perhaps even more alarming—65% of blacks and 58% of Hispanics (compared to 22% of whites) were afraid of being treated unfairly in the future based on their race/ethnicity **(Fig. 10-10)**. This mistrust may contribute to wariness in accepting or following recommendations, undergoing invasive procedures, or participating in clinical research, and these choices, in turn, may lead to misunderstanding and the perpetuation of stereotypes among health professionals. \n\n#### ■ KEY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS RACIAL/ \n\n#### ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE \n\nUnequal Treatment provides recommendations to address the root causes of racial/ethnic disparities organized as health system interventions, provider interventions, patient interventions, and general recommendations. \n\n#### Health System Interventions * COLLECTING, REPORTING, AND \n\n**TRACKING OF DATA ON HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND USE, BY PATIENTS’** \n\n#### RACE/ETHNICITY Unequal Treatment found that the appropriate \n\nsystems to track and monitor racial and ethnic disparities in health care are lacking and that less is known about the disparities affecting minority groups other than African Americans (Hispanics, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and Alaskan Natives). For instance, only in the mid-1980s did the Medicare database begin to collect data on patient groups outside the standard categories of “white,” “black,” and “other.” Federal, private, and state-supported data-collection efforts are scattered and unsystematic, and many health care systems and hospitals still do not collect data on the race, ethnicity, or primary language of enrollees or patients. A survey by the Institute for Diversity in Health Management and the Health Research and Educational Trust in 2015 found that 98% of 1083 U.S. hospitals collected information on race, 95% collected data on ethnicity, and 94% collected data on primary language. However, only 45% collected \n\n data on race, 40% collected data on ethnicity, and 38% collected data on primary language to benchmark gaps in care. A survey by America’s Health Insurance Plans Foundation in 2008 and 2010 showed that the proportion of enrollees in plans that collected race/ethnicity data of some type increased from 75 to 79%; however, the total percentage of plan enrollees whose race/ethnicity and language are recorded is still much lower than these figures. COLLECTING, REPORTING, AND TRACKING OF SDOH DATA In 2014, the IOM Committee on Recommended Social and Behavioral Domains and Measures for Electronic Health Records recommended the routine collection, in the electronic health record, of a parsimonious panel of clinically significant SDOH measures that may be obtained by selfreport in advance of or during the health care encounter and, when used together, provide a psychosocial vital sign. The IOM-recommended questionnaire includes 25 items addressing the following domains: race and ethnicity, education, financial resource strain, stress, depression, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use, social connection or isolation, intimate partner violence, residential address, and geocoded census tract median income. Implementation studies have demonstrated that collection of these data takes about 5 minutes, and both patients and providers saw this data collection as appropriate and important. Given that data access and monitoring is an essential component to disparities elimination, we highlight several important sources of up-todate racial/ethnic disparities monitoring initiatives that are available to the general public and are updated regularly. We highlight only three examples of national data sources. \n\n- Since 2003, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has     led the yearly compilation of The National Healthcare Quality and     Disparities Report, which reports trends for measures related to     access to health care, affordable care, care coordination, healthy liv-     ing, patient safety, and the quality of care across acute and chronic     disease management by race/ethnicity, income, and other SDOH     (https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/index.html). \n\n- Since 2011, the Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program     (GRASP) created and maintains the Centers for Disease Control     and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index. This database maps, for     all U.S. Census tracts, 15 social factors (grouped in four SDOH cat-     egories: socioeconomic status, housing composition and disability,     minority status and language, and housing and transportation) and     is updated every 2 years (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/     svi/index.html). \n\n- Launched in 2018, the Health Opportunity and Equity (HOPE) Ini-     tiative benchmarks and tracks 27 indicators by race, ethnicity, and     socioeconomic status. The indicators measure social and economic     factors, community and safety, physical environment, access to     health care, and health outcomes for the United States (https://www     .nationalcollaborative.org/our-programs/hope-initiative-project/). \n\n INCREASE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ACCESS Lack of access to high-quality health care is an important driver of racial/ethnic disparities. Signed into law in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) fundamentally transformed health insurance by decreasing the uninsured population from 16.3% in 2010 (~49.9 million) to 8.8.% in 2016 (~28.1 million). This represents the largest expansion of health insurance since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Prior to the ACA, non-Hispanic blacks were 70% and Hispanics nearly three times more likely to be uninsured than non-Hispanic whites. Of note, Medicaid expansion accounted for an estimated 60% of the ACA’s effect through a combination of expanded eligibility and increased enrollment of previously eligible but unenrolled people. This is important given the higher number of racial/ethnic minorities who obtain insurance through Medicaid. Many studies have demonstrated that increased insurance coverage has also translated to greater improvement for blacks and Hispanics in access to care, more access to a usual source of care, and improved health outcomes. ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Unequal Treatment highlights the subjectivity of clinical decision-making as a potential cause of racial and \n\n 020406080 \n\n Future unfa \n\n ir \n\n Tx based onrace/ethnicity \n\n Past unfa \n\n ir \n\n Tx based onrace/ethnici \n\n ty Whites Blacks Latinos \n\n 15 \n\n 35 \n\n 36 \n\n 22 \n\n 65 \n\n 58 \n\n Percent \n\n**FIGURE 10-10 Patient perspectives regarding unfair treatment (Tx) based on race/ ethnicity.** The reference population consisted of 3884 individuals surveyed about how fairly they had been treated in the health care system in the past and how fairly they felt they would be treated in the future on the basis of their race/ethnicity. (From Race, Ethnicity \u0026 Medical Care: A Survey of Public Perceptions and Experiences. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005.) \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n ethnic disparities in health care by describing how clinicians—despite the existence of well-delineated practice guidelines—may offer (consciously or unconsciously) different diagnostic and therapeutic options to different patients on the basis of their race or ethnicity. Therefore, the widespread adoption and implementation of evidence-based guidelines is a key recommendation in eliminating disparities. For instance, evidence-based guidelines are now available for the management of diabetes, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancer screening and management, and asthma—all areas where significant disparities exist. As part of ongoing quality-improvement efforts, particular attention should be paid to the implementation of evidence-based guidelines for all patients, regardless of their race and ethnicity. SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION SERVICES IN THE CLINICAL SETTING As described previously, a lack of efficient and effective interpreter services in a health care system can lead to patient dissatisfaction, to poor comprehension and adherence, and thus to ineffective/lower-quality care for patients with limited English proficiency. Unequal Treatment’s recommendation to support the use of interpretation services has clear implications for delivery of quality health care by improving doctors’ ability to communicate effectively with these patients. INCREASES IN THE PROPORTION OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE Data for 2018 from the Association of American Medical Colleges indicate that of active physicians, 56.2% identified as white, 5.8% identified as Hispanic, 5.0% identified as black or African American, and 0.3% identified as Native American or Alaskan Natives. Furthermore, U.S. national data show that only 3.6% of full-time faculty are black or African American, and 5.5% are Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin (alone or in combination with another race/ethnicity), compared to 63.9% who identified as white. Longitudinal data demonstrate that minority faculty are more likely to be at or below the rank of assistant professor, while whites composed the highest proportion of full professors. Similarly, several studies have found that both Hispanic and black faculty were promoted at lower rates than their white counterparts. Despite representing ~30% of the U.S. population (a number projected to almost double by 2050), minority students are still underrepresented in medical schools. In 2018, matriculates to U.S. medical schools were 6.2% Latino, 7.1% African American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 0.2% Native American or Alaskan Native. These percentages have decreased or remained nearly the same since 2007. It will be difficult to develop a diverse physician workforce that can meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population without dramatic changes in the racial and ethnic composition of medical student bodies. Long-term investment in pipeline programs and the nearly universal adoption of holistic admissions (a process by which schools consider each applicant individually to determine how they might contribute to the learning environment and the workforce instead of relying just on test scores and grades) have produced modest results. Institutional change in medical schools, focused on creating nurturing, inclusive, and equity-focused environments that dismantle the structural racism that has created the opportunity gap faced by many minority students, is needed to address this important workforce challenge. \n\n#### Provider Interventions * INTEGRATION OF CROSS-CULTURAL EDU\n\n#### CATION INTO THE TRAINING OF ALL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS \n\n The goal of cross-cultural education is to improve providers’ ability to understand, communicate with, and care for patients from diverse backgrounds. Such education focuses on enhancing awareness of sociocultural influences on health beliefs and behaviors and on building skills to facilitate understanding and management of these factors in the medical encounter. Cross-cultural education includes curricula on health care disparities, use of interpreters, and effective communication and negotiation across cultures. These curricula can be incorporated into health professions training in medical schools, residency programs, nursing schools, and other health professions programs, and can be offered as a component of continuing education. Despite the importance of this area of education and the attention it has attracted from medical education accreditation bodies, a national survey of \n\n senior resident physicians by Weissman and colleagues found that up to 28% felt unprepared to deal with cross-cultural issues, including caring for patients who have religious beliefs that may affect treatment, patients who use complementary medicine, patients who have health beliefs at odds with Western medicine, patients who mistrust the health care system, and new immigrants. In a study at one medical school, 70% of fourth-year students felt inadequately prepared to care for patients with limited English proficiency. Efforts to incorporate crosscultural education into medical education will contribute to improving communication and to providing a better quality of care for all patients. INCORPORATION OF TEACHING ON THE IMPACT OF RACE, ETHNICITY, AND CULTURE ON CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING Unequal Treatment and more recent studies found that stereotyping by health care providers can lead to disparate treatment based on a patient’s race or ethnicity. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, which accredits medical schools, issued a directive that medical education should include instruction on how a patient’s race, ethnicity, and culture might unconsciously impact communication and clinical decision-making. \n\n#### Patient Interventions Difficulty navigating the health care sys\n\n tem and obtaining access to care can be a hindrance to all populations, particularly to minorities. Similarly, lack of empowerment or involvement in the medical encounter by minorities can be a barrier to care. Patients need to be educated on how to navigate the health care system and how best to access care. Interventions should be used to increase patients’ participation in treatment decisions. \n\n#### General Recommendations * INCREASE AWARENESS OF RACIAL/ \n\n#### ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE Efforts to raise awareness of \n\n racial/ethnic health care disparities have done little for the general public but have been fairly successful among physicians, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. In 2006, nearly 6 in 10 people surveyed believed that blacks received the same quality of care as whites, and 5 in 10 believed that Latinos received the same quality of care as whites. These estimates are similar to findings in a 1999 survey. Despite this lack of awareness, most people believed that all Americans deserve quality care, regardless of their background. In contrast, the level of awareness among physicians has risen sharply. In 2002, the majority (69%) of physicians said that the health care system “rarely or never” treated people unfairly on the basis of their racial/ethnic background. In 2005, less than one-quarter (24%) of physicians disagreed with the statement that “minority patients generally receive lower-quality care than white patients.” More recently, a survey by WebMD showed that 42% of 16,000 physicians admitted that their own personal biases impact their clinical decision-making, including on characteristics such as race and ethnicity. Increasing awareness of racial and ethnic health disparities, and their root causes, among health care professionals and the public is an important first step in addressing these disparities. The ultimate goals are to generate discourse and to mobilize action to address disparities at multiple levels, including health policymakers, health systems, and the community. CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF DISPARITIES AND PROMISING INTERVENTIONS While the literature that formed the basis for the findings reported and recommendations made in Unequal Treatment provided significant evidence for racial and ethnic disparities, additional research is needed in several areas. First, most of the literature on disparities focuses on black-versus-white differences; much less is known about the experiences of other minority groups. Improving the ability to collect racial and ethnic patient data should facilitate this process. However, in instances where the necessary systems are not yet in place, racial and ethnic patient data may be collected prospectively in the setting of clinical or health services research to more fully elucidate disparities for other populations. Second, much of the literature on disparities to date has focused on defining areas in which these disparities exist, but less has been done to identify the multiple factors that contribute to the disparities or to test interventions to address these factors. There is clearly a need for research that identifies promising practices and solutions to disparities. \n\n---\n\n#### Ethical Issues in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 11 \n\n#### ■ IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE \n\nIndividual health care providers can do several things in the clinical encounter to address racial and ethnic disparities in health care. \n\n#### Be Aware That Disparities Exist Increasing awareness of racial \n\nand ethnic disparities among health care professionals is an important first step in addressing disparities in health care. Only with greater awareness can care providers be attuned to their behavior in clinical practice and thus monitor that behavior and ensure that all patients receive the highest quality of care, regardless of race, ethnicity, or culture. \n\n#### Practice Culturally Competent Care Previous efforts have \n\nbeen made to teach clinicians about the attitudes, values, beliefs, and behaviors of certain cultural groups—the key practice “dos and don’ts” in caring for “the Hispanic patient” or the “Asian patient,” for example. In certain situations, learning about a particular local community or cultural group, with a goal of following the principles of communityoriented primary care, can be helpful; when broadly and uncritically applied, however, this approach can actually lead to stereotyping and oversimplification of culture, without respect for its complexity. Cultural competence has thus evolved from merely learning information and making assumptions about patients on the basis of their backgrounds to focusing on the development of skills that follow the principles of patient-centered care. Patient-centeredness encompasses the qualities of compassion, empathy, and responsiveness to the needs, values, and expressed preferences of the individual patient. Cultural competence aims to take things a step further by expanding the repertoire of knowledge and skills classically defined as “patient-centered” to include those that are especially useful in cross-cultural interactions (and that, in fact, are vital in all clinical encounters). This repertoire includes effectively using interpreter services, eliciting the patient’s understanding of his or her condition, assessing decision-making preferences and the role of family, determining the patient’s views about biomedicine versus complementary and alternative medicine, recognizing sexual and gender issues, and building trust. For example, while it is important to understand all patients’ beliefs about health, it may be particularly crucial to understand the health beliefs of patients who come from a different culture or have a different health care experience. With the individual patient as teacher, the physician can adjust his or her practice style to meet the patient’s specific needs. \n\n#### Avoid Stereotyping Several strategies can allow health care pro\n\nviders to counteract, both systemically and individually, the normal tendency to stereotype. For example, when racially/ethnically/culturally/ socially diverse teams in which each member is given equal power are assembled and are tasked to achieve a common goal, a sense of camaraderie develops and prevents the development of stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, culture, or class. Thus, health care providers should aim to gain experiences working with and learning from a diverse set of colleagues. In addition, simply being aware of the operation of social cognitive factors allows providers to actively check up on or monitor their behavior. Physicians can constantly reevaluate to ensure that they are offering the same things, in the same ways, to all patients. Understanding one’s own susceptibility to stereotyping— and how disparities may result—is essential in providing equitable, high-quality care to all patients. \n\n#### Work to Build Trust Patients’ mistrust of the health care system \n\nand of health care providers impacts multiple facets of the medical encounter, with effects ranging from decreased patient satisfaction to delayed care. Although the historic legacy of discrimination can never be erased, several steps can be taken to build trust with patients and to address disparities. First, providers must be aware that mistrust exists and is more prevalent among minority populations, given the history of discrimination in the United States and other countries. Second, providers must reassure patients that they come first, that everything possible will be done to ensure that they always get the best care available, and that their caregivers will serve as their advocates. Third, interpersonal skills and communication techniques that demonstrate honesty, openness, compassion, and respect on the part of the health \n\n care provider are essential tools in dismantling mistrust. Finally, patients indicate that trust is built when there is shared, participatory decision-making and the provider makes a concerted effort to understand the patient’s background. When the doctor–patient relationship is reframed as one of solidarity, the patient’s sense of vulnerability can be transformed into one of trust. The successful elimination of disparities requires trust-building interventions and strengthening of this relationship. \n\n#### ■ CONCLUSION \n\n The issue of racial and ethnic disparities in health care has gained national prominence, both with the release of the IOM report Unequal Treatment and with more recent articles that have confirmed their persistence and explored their root causes. Furthermore, another influential IOM report, Crossing the Quality Chasm, has highlighted the importance of equity—i.e., no variations in quality of care due to personal characteristics, including race and ethnicity—as a central principle of quality. Current efforts in health care reform and transformation, including a greater focus on value (high-quality care and cost-control), will sharpen the nation’s focus on the care of populations who experience low-quality, costly care. Addressing disparities will become a major focus, and there will be many obvious opportunities for interventions to eliminate them. Greater attention to addressing the root causes of disparities will improve the care provided to all patients, not just those who belong to racial and ethnic minorities. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Buchmueller TC et al: The ACA’s impact on racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage and access to care.

For example, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, handheld personal devices, and learning health care systems all hold the promise of more coordinated and comprehensive care, but also raise concerns about confidentiality, the doctor–patient relationship, and responsibility. This chapter presents approaches and principles that physicians can use to address important vexing ethical issues they \n\n# 11 \n\n## Ethical Issues in Clinical \n\n## Medicine \n\n Christine Grady, Bernard Lo \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n encounter in their work. Physicians make ethical judgments about clinical situations every day. They should prepare for lifelong learning about ethical issues so they can respond appropriately. Traditional professional codes and ethical principles provide instructive guidance for physicians but need to be interpreted and applied to each situation. When facing or struggling with a challenging ethical issue, physicians may need to reevaluate their basic convictions, tolerate uncertainty, and maintain their integrity while respecting the opinions of others. Physicians should articulate their concerns and reasoning, discuss and listen to the views of others involved in the case, and utilize available resources, including other health care team members, palliative care, social work, and spiritual care. Moreover, ethics consultation services or a hospital ethics committee can help to clarify issues and identify strategies for resolution, including improving communication and dealing with strong or conflicting emotions. Through these efforts, physicians can gain deeper insight into the ethical issues they face and usually reach mutually acceptable resolutions to complex problems. \n\n## APPROACHES TO ETHICAL PROBLEMS \n\n Several approaches are useful for resolving ethical issues, including approaches based on ethical principles, virtue ethics, professional oaths, and personal values. These various sources of guidance may seem to conflict in a particular case, leaving the physician in a quandary. In a diverse society, different individuals may turn to different sources of moral guidance. In addition, general moral precepts often need to be interpreted and applied to a particular clinical situation. \n\n#### ■ ETHICAL PRINCIPLES \n\n Ethical principles can serve as general guidelines to help physicians determine the right thing to do. \n\n#### Respecting Patients Physicians should always treat patients with \n\n respect, which entails understanding patients’ goals, providing information, communicating effectively, obtaining informed and voluntary consent, respecting informed refusals, and protecting confidentiality. Different clinical goals and approaches are often feasible, and interventions can result in both benefit and harm. Individuals differ in how they value health and medical care and how they weigh the benefits and risks of medical interventions. Generally, physicians should respect patients’ values and informed choices. Treating patients with respect is especially important when patients are responding to experiences of, or fears about, disrespect and discrimination. GOALS AND TREATMENT DECISIONS Physicians should provide relevant and accurate information for patients about diagnoses, current clinical circumstances, expected future course, prognosis, treatment options, and uncertainties, and discuss patients’ goals of care. Physicians may be tempted to withhold a serious diagnosis, misrepresent it by using ambiguous terms, or limit discussions of prognosis or risks for fear that patients will become anxious or depressed. Providing honest information about clinical situations promotes patients’ autonomy and trust as well as sound communication with patients and colleagues. When physicians have to share bad news with patients, they should adjust the pace of disclosure, offer empathy and hope, provide emotional support, and call on other resources such as spiritual care or social work to help patients cope. Some patients may choose not to receive such information or may ask surrogates to make decisions on their behalf, as is common with serious diagnoses in some traditional cultures. SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT Physicians should engage their patients in shared decision-making about their health and their care, whenever appropriate. Physicians should discuss with patients the nature, risks, and benefits of proposed care; any alternative; and the likely consequences of each option. Physicians promote shared decision-making by informing and educating patients, answering their questions, checking that they understand key issues, making recommendations, and helping them to deliberate. Medical jargon, needlessly complicated explanations, or the provision of too much information at once may overwhelm patients. Increasingly, decision aids can assist patients in playing a more active role in \n\n decision-making, improving the accuracy of their perception of risk and benefit, and helping them feel better informed and clearer about their values. Informed consent is more than obtaining signatures on consent forms and involves disclosure of honest and understandable information to promote understanding and choice. Competent, informed patients may refuse recommended interventions and choose among reasonable alternatives. In an emergency, treatment can be given without informed consent if patients cannot give their own consent and delaying treatment while surrogates are contacted would jeopardize patients’ lives or health. People are presumed to want such emergency care unless they have previously indicated otherwise. Respect for patients does not entitle patients to insist on any care or treatment that they want. Physicians are not obligated to provide interventions that have no physiologic rationale, that have already failed, or that are contrary to evidence-based practice recommendations or good clinical judgment. Public policies and laws also dictate certain decisions—e.g., allocation of scarce medical resources during a public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, use of cadaveric organs for transplantation, and requests for physician aid in dying. \n\n CARING FOR PATIENTS WHO LACK DECISION-MAKING CAPACITY Some patients are unable to make informed decisions because of unconsciousness, advanced dementia, delirium, or other medical conditions. Courts have the legal authority to determine that a patient is legally incompetent, but in practice, physicians usually determine when patients lack the capacity to make particular health care decisions and arrange for authorized surrogates to make decisions, without involving the courts. Patients with decision-making capacity can express a choice and appreciate their medical situation; the nature, risks, and benefits of proposed care; and the consequences of each alternative. Patient choices should be consistent with their values and not the result of delusions, hallucinations, or misinformation. Physicians should use available and validated assessment tools, resources such as psychiatry or ethics consultation, and clinical judgment to ascertain whether individuals have the capacity to make decisions for themselves. Patients should not be assumed to lack capacity if they disagree with recommendations or refuse treatment. Such decisions should be probed, however, to ensure the patient is not deciding based on misunderstandings and has the capacity to make an informed decision. When impairments are fluctuating or reversible, decisions should be postponed if possible until the patient recovers decision-making capacity. When a patient lacks decision-making capacity, physicians seek an appropriate surrogate. Patients may designate a health care proxy through an advance directive or on a Physician Orders for LifeSustaining Treatment form; such choices should be respected (see Chap. 12 ). For patients who lack decision-making capacity and have not previously designated a health care proxy, family members usually serve as surrogates. Statutes in most U.S. states delineate a prioritized list of relatives to make medical decisions. Patients’ values, goals, and previously expressed preferences guide surrogate decisions. However, the patient’s current best interests may sometimes justify overriding earlier preferences if an intervention is likely to provide significant benefit, previous statements do not fit the situation well, or the patient gave the surrogate leeway in decisions. \n\n MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY Maintaining confidentiality is essential to respecting patients’ autonomy and privacy; it encourages patients to seek treatment and to discuss problems candidly. However, confidentiality may be overridden to prevent serious harm to third parties or the patient. Exceptions to confidentiality are justified when the risk to others is serious and probable, no less restrictive measures can avert risk, and the adverse effects of overriding confidentiality are minimized and deemed acceptable by society. For example, laws require physicians to report cases of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infection, elder or child abuse, and domestic violence. \n\n#### Beneficence or Acting in Patients’ Best Interests The prin\n\n ciple of beneficence requires physicians to act for the patient’s benefit. Patients typically lack medical expertise, and illness may make them vulnerable. Patients rely on and trust physicians to treat them with \n\n---\n\n#### Ethical Issues in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 11 \n\ncompassion and provide sound recommendations and treatments aimed to promote their well-being. Physicians encourage such trust and have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of patients, which should prevail over physicians’ self-interest or the interests of third parties such as hospitals or insurers. A principle related to beneficence, “first do no harm,” obliges physicians to prevent unnecessary harm by recommending interventions that maximize benefit and minimize harm and forbids physicians from providing known ineffective interventions or acting without due care. Although often cited, this precept alone provides limited guidance because many beneficial interventions also pose serious risks. Physicians increasingly provide care within interdisciplinary teams and rely on consultation with or referral to specialists. Team members and consultants contribute different types of expertise to the provision of comprehensive, high-quality care for patients. Physicians should collaborate with and respect the contributions of the various interdisciplinary team members and should initiate and participate in regular communication and planning to avoid diffusion of responsibility and ensure accountability for quality patient care. \n\n**INFLUENCES ON PATIENTS’ BEST INTERESTS** Conflicts arise when patients’ refusal or request of interventions thwarts their own goals for care, causes serious harm, or conflicts with their best medical interests. For example, simply accepting a young asthmatic adult’s refusal of mechanical ventilation for reversible respiratory failure, in the name of respecting autonomy, is morally constricted. Physicians should elicit patients’ expectations and concerns, correct their misunderstandings, and try to persuade them to accept beneficial therapies. If disagreements persist after such efforts, physicians should call on institutional resources for assistance, but patients’ informed choices and views of their own best interests should prevail. Drug prices and out-of-pocket expenses for patients have been escalating in many parts of the world and may compromise care that is in the patients’ best interests. Physicians should recognize that patients, especially those with high copayments or inadequate insurance, may not be able to afford prescribed tests and interventions. Physicians should strive to prescribe medications that are affordable and acceptable to the patient. Knowing what kind of insurance, if any, the patient has and whether certain medications are likely to be covered may help in determining appropriate prescriptions. Available alternatives should be considered and discussed. Physicians should follow up with patients who don’t fill prescriptions, don’t take their medications, or skip doses to explore whether cost and affordability are obstacles. It may be reasonable for physicians to advocate for coverage of nonformulary products for sound reasons, such as when the formulary drugs are less effective or not tolerated or are too costly for the patient to pay for out of pocket. These should be shared decisions with the patient to the extent possible. Organizational policies and workplace conditions may sometimes conflict with patients’ best interests. Physicians’ focus and dedication to the well-being and interests of patients may be negatively influenced by perceived or actual staffing inadequacies, unfair wages, infrastructural deficiencies or lack of equipment, work-hour limitations, corporate culture, and threats to personal security in the workplace. Physicians should work with institutional leaders to ensure that policies and practices support their ability to provide quality care focused on patients’ best interests. Patients’ interests are served by improvements in overall quality of care and the increasing use of evidence-based practice guidelines and performance benchmarking. However, practice guideline recommendations may not serve the interests of each individual patient, especially when another plan of care may provide substantially greater benefits. In prioritizing their duty to act in the patient’s best interests, physicians should be familiar with relevant practice guidelines, be able to recognize situations that might justify exceptions, and advocate for reasonable exceptions. \n\n#### Acting Justly The principle of justice provides guidance to physi\n\ncians about how to ethically treat patients and make decisions about allocating important resources, including their own time. Justice in a \n\n general sense means fairness: people should receive what they deserve. In addition, it is important to act consistently in cases that are similar in ethically relevant ways, in order to avoid arbitrary, biased, and unfair decisions. Justice forbids discrimination in health care based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, or other personal characteristics (Chap. 10). ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES Justice also requires fair allocation of limited health care resources. Universal access to medically needed health care remains an unrealized moral aspiration in the United States and many countries around the world. Patients with no or inadequate health insurance often cannot afford health care and lack access to safety-net services. Even among insured patients, insurers may deny coverage for interventions recommended by their physician. In this situation, physicians should advocate for patients’ affordable access to indicated care, try to help patients obtain needed care, and work with institutions and policies to promote wider access. Doctors might consider—or patients might request—the use of lies or deception to obtain such benefits, for example, signing a disability form for a patient who does not meet disability criteria. Although motivated by a desire to help the patient, such deception breaches basic ethical guidelines and undermines physicians’ credibility and trustworthiness. Allocation of health care resources is unavoidable when resources are limited. Allocation policies should be fair, transparent, accountable, responsive to the concerns of those affected, and proportionate to the situation, including the supply relative to the need. In the 2019–2020 SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, some epicenters anticipated or faced shortages of staff, protective equipment, hospital and critical care beds, and ventilators, even after increasing supplies and modifying usual clinical procedures. Many jurisdictions developed guidelines for implementing crisis standards of care to allocate limited interventions and services. Under crisis standards of care, some aspects of conventional care are not possible and interventions may not be provided to all who might benefit or wish to receive them. Crisis standards of care aim to promote the good of the community by saving the most lives in the short term, using evidence-based criteria. When demand for medications or other interventions exceeds the supply, allocation should be fair, strive to avoid discrimination, and mitigate health disparities. First-come, first-served allocation is not fair, because it disadvantages patients who experience barriers to accessing care. To avoid discrimination, allocation decisions should not consider personal social characteristics such as race, gender, or disability, nor consider insurance status or wealth. Allocation policies also should aspire to reduce health care disparities. U.S. African-American, Latino-American, and Native-American patients suffered a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, likely due in part to being employed in jobs that cannot be done remotely or with physical distancing, crowded housing, lack of health benefits, and poor access to health care. Fair and well-considered guidelines help mitigate any emotional and moral distress that clinicians may experience making difficult allocation decisions. Authorizing triage officers or committees to make allocation decisions according to policies determined with public input allows treating physicians and nurses to dedicate their efforts to their patients. Ad hoc resource allocation by physicians at the bedside may be inconsistent, unfair, and ineffective. At the bedside, physicians should act as patient advocates within constraints set by society, reasonable insurance policies, and evidence-based practice. Many allocation decisions are made at the level of public policy, with physician and public input. For example, the United Network for Organ Sharing (www.unos.org) provides criteria for allocating scarce organs. \n\n#### ■ VIRTUE ETHICS \n\n Virtue ethics focuses on physicians’ character and qualities, with the expectation that doctors will cultivate virtues such as compassion, trustworthiness, intellectual honesty, humility, and integrity. Proponents argue that, if such characteristics become ingrained, they help guide physicians in unforeseen situations. Moreover, following ethical precepts or principles without any of these virtues could lead to uncaring doctor–patient relationships. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n#### ■ PROFESSIONAL OATHS AND CODES \n\n Professional oaths and codes are useful guides for physicians. Most physicians take oaths during their medical training, and many are members of professional societies that have professional codes. Physicians pledge to the public and to their patients that they will be guided by the principles and values in these oaths or codes and commit to the spirit of the ethical ideals and precepts represented in oaths and professional codes of ethics. \n\n#### ■ PERSONAL VALUES \n\n Personal values, cultural traditions, and religious beliefs are important sources of personal morality that help physicians address ethical issues and cope with any moral distress they may experience in practice. While essential, personal morality alone is a limited ethical guide in clinical practice. Physicians have role-specific ethical obligations that go beyond their obligations as good people, including the duties to obtain informed consent and maintain confidentiality discussed earlier. Furthermore, in a culturally and religiously diverse world, physicians should expect that some patients and colleagues will have personal moral beliefs that differ from their own. \n\n## ETHICALLY COMPLEX PROFESSIONAL \n\n## ISSUES FOR PHYSICIANS \n\n#### ■ CLAIMS OF CONSCIENCE \n\n Some physicians, based on their personal values, have conscientious objections to providing, or referring patients for, certain treatments such as contraception or physician aid in dying. Although physicians should not be asked to violate deeply held moral beliefs or religious convictions, patients need medically appropriate, timely care and should always be treated with respect. Institutions such as clinics and hospitals have a collective ethical duty to provide care that patients need while making reasonable attempts to accommodate health care workers’ conscientious objections—for example, when possible by arranging for another professional to provide the service in question. Patients seeking a relationship with a doctor or health care institution should be notified in advance of any conscientious objections to the provision of specific interventions. Since insurance often constrains patients’ selection of physicians or health care facilities, switching providers can be burdensome. There are also important limits on claims of conscience. Health care workers may not insist that patients receive unwanted medical interventions. They also may not refuse to treat or discriminate against patients because of their race, ethnicity, disability, genetic information, or diagnosis. Such discrimination is illegal and violates physicians’ duties to respect patients. Refusal to treat patients for other reasons such as sexual orientation, gender identity, or other personal characteristics is legally more controversial, yet ethically inappropriate because it falls short of helping patients in need and respecting them as persons. \n\n#### ■ PHYSICIAN AS GATEKEEPER \n\n In some cases, patients may ask their physicians to facilitate access to services that the physician has ethical qualms about providing. For example, a patient might request a prescription for a cognitively enhancing medication to temporarily augment his cognitive abilities in order to take an exam or apply for employment. Patients may request more pain medication than the physician believes is warranted for the given situation or marijuana to facilitate sleep. Patients may ask their physician to sign a waiver to avoid vaccines for reasons that are not included in state exceptions (see Chap. 3 ). A physician may feel uncomfortable prescribing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications to a young child because she is not convinced that the possible benefit justifies the risks to the child despite the parent’s request. In these circumstances, the physician should work with the patient or parent to understand the reasons for their requests, some of which might be legitimate. In addition to considering possible risks and benefits to the patient, the physician should consider how meeting the request might affect other patients, societal values, and public trust in the medical profession. If the physician determines that fulfilling the request requires deception, is unfair, jeopardizes her professional \n\n responsibilities, or is inconsistent with the patient’s best medical interests, the physician should decline and explain the reasons to the patient. \n\n#### ■ MORAL DISTRESS \n\n Health care providers, including residents, medical students, and experienced physicians, may experience moral distress when they feel that ethically appropriate action is hindered by institutional policies or culture, decision-making hierarchies, limited resources, or other reasons. Moral distress can lead to anger, anxiety, depression, frustration, fatigue, work dissatisfaction, and burnout. A physician’s health and well-being can affect how he or she cares for patients. Discussing complex or unfamiliar clinical situations with colleagues and seeking assistance with difficult decisions can help alleviate moral distress, as can a healthy work environment characterized by open communication, mutual respect, and emphasis on the common goal of good patient care. In addition, physicians should take good care of their own well-being and be aware of the personal and system factors associated with stress, burnout, and depression. Health care organizations should provide a supportive work environment, counseling, and other support services when needed. \n\n#### ■ OCCUPATIONAL RISKS AND BURDENS \n\n Physicians accept some physical risk in fulfilling their professional responsibilities, including exposure to infectious agents or toxic substances, violence in the workplace, and musculoskeletal injury. Nonetheless, most physicians, nurses, and other hospital staff willingly care for patients, despite personal risk and fear, grueling hours, and sometimes inadequate personal protective equipment or information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many communities honored clinicians’ dedication to professional ideals, and some medical students who were relieved from in-person patient care responsibilities volunteered to support front-line workers in other ways. The burdens of navigating professional and personal responsibilities fall more heavily on women health care providers. Health care institutions are responsible for reducing occupational risk and burden by providing proper information, training and supervision, protective equipment, infrastructure and workflow modifications, and emotional and psychological support to physicians. Clinical leaders need to acknowledge fears about personal safety and take steps to mitigate the impact of work on family responsibilities, moral distress, and burnout. \n\n#### ■ USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND PATIENT PORTALS \n\n Increasingly, physicians use social and electronic media to share information and advice with patients and other providers. Social networking may be especially useful in reaching young or otherwise hard-to-access patients. Patients increasingly access their physicians’ notes through patient portals, which aim to transparently share information, promote patient engagement, and increase adherence. Physicians should be professional and respectful and consider patient confidentiality, professional boundaries, and therapeutic relationships when posting to social media or writing notes for the portal. Overall, appropriate use of these platforms can enhance communication and transparency while avoiding misunderstandings or harmful consequences for patients, physicians, or their colleagues. Unprofessional or careless posts that express frustration or anger over work incidents, disparage patients or colleagues, use offensive or discriminatory language, or reveal inappropriate personal information about the physician can have negative consequences. Physicians should separate professional from personal websites and accounts and follow institutional and professional society guidelines when communicating with patients. \n\n## CONFLICTS OF INTEREST \n\n Acting in patients’ best interests may sometimes conflict with a physician’s self-interest or the interests of third parties such as insurers or hospitals. From an ethical viewpoint, patients’ interests are paramount. Transparency, appropriate disclosure, and management of conflicts of interest are essential to maintain the trust of colleagues and the public. Disclosure requirements vary for different purposes, and software has \n\n---\n\n#### Ethical Issues in Clinical Medicine \n\n#### CHAPTER 11 \n\nbeen developed to assist physicians in complying with specific requirements. Importantly, not all conflicts are financial. Physicians sometimes face conflicts of commitment between their patient’s interests and their own personal interests, professional goals, responsibilities, and aspirations. As mentioned earlier, physicians should prioritize patients’ interests while recognizing possible conflicts and using disclosure, discussion with the chief of service, and management of the conflict or recusal when appropriate. In addition to individual physicians, medical institutions may have conflicts of interest arising from patent rights, industry-funded research programs, and donations from individuals and companies. Institutions need to be transparent about the presence and amount of such relationships and make clear the steps taken to prevent such relationships from having an impact on clinical or financial decisions. If there is good evidence that a donor acted in ways that breached ethical or legal standards, the institution should take steps not to benefit from the donation or honor the donor. \n\n#### ■ FINANCIAL INCENTIVES \n\nPhysicians have financial incentives to improve the quality or efficiency of care that might lead some to avoid patients who are older, are chronically ill, or have more complicated problems, or to focus on benchmarked outcomes even when not in the best interests of individual patients. In contrast, fee-for-service payments might encourage physicians to order more interventions than necessary or to refer patients to laboratory, imaging, or surgical facilities in which they have a financial stake. Regardless of financial incentives, physicians should recommend available care that is in the patient’s best interests—no more and no less. \n\n#### ■ RELATIONSHIPS WITH PHARMACEUTICAL \n\n#### COMPANIES \n\nFinancial relationships between physicians and industry are increasingly scrutinized. Many academic medical centers have banned drug-company gifts, including branded pens and notepads and meals to physicians, to reduce inappropriate risk of undue influence or subconscious feelings of reciprocity and to decrease possible influences on public trust or the costs of health care. The federal Open Payments website provides public information on the payments and amounts that drug and device companies give to individual physicians by name. The challenge is to distinguish payments for scientific consulting and research contracts—which should be encouraged as consistent with professional and academic missions—from those for promotional speaking and consulting whose goal is to increase sales of company products. \n\n#### ■ LEARNING CLINICAL SKILLS \n\nMedical students’, residents’, and physicians’ interests in learning, which fosters the long-term goal of benefiting future patients, may sometimes conflict with the short-term goal of providing optimal care to current patients. When trainees are learning procedures on patients, they lack the proficiency of experienced physicians, and patients may experience inconvenience, discomfort, longer procedures, or increased risk. Increasingly, institutions are developing clinical skills laboratories for simulation-based medical education and requiring students to demonstrate proficiency before carrying out procedures such as venipuncture and intravenous lines in patients. Furthermore, teaching hospitals are establishing proceduralist services in which procedure-specialist faculty members directly supervise interns for procedures such as lumbar puncture and thoracentesis and certify their proficiency. Medical students may need to defer learning such invasive procedures until internship. Seeking patients’ consent for trainee participation in their care is always important and is particularly important for intimate examinations, such as pelvic, rectal, breast, and testicular examinations, and for invasive procedures. Patients should be told who is providing care and how trainees are supervised. Failing to introduce students or not telling patients that trainees will be performing procedures undermines trust, may lead to more elaborate deception, and makes it difficult for patients to make informed choices about their care. Most patients, when informed, allow trainees to play an active role in their care. \n\n#### ■ RESPONSE TO MEDICAL ERRORS \n\n Errors are inevitable in clinical medicine, and some errors cause harm to patients. Most errors are caused by lapses of attention or flaws in the system of delivering health care; only a small number result from blameworthy individual behavior. Many health care institutions have adopted a just culture system, which encourages open and honest reporting of errors as essential to quality learning and shifts the focus from individual blame to system design for improvement in quality and safety (Chap. 8). This approach is more likely than a punitive approach to improve patient safety. However, professional discipline is appropriate for cases of gross incompetence, reckless behavior, physician impairment, and boundary violations. Physicians and students may fear that disclosing errors will damage their careers. Physicians and health care institutions show respect for patients by disclosing and explaining errors, offering an apology, offering appropriate compensation for harm done, and using errors as opportunities to improve the quality of care. \n\n#### ■ PHYSICIAN IMPAIRMENT \n\n Physicians may hesitate to intervene when colleagues impaired by alcohol, drugs, or psychiatric or medical illness place patients at risk. However, society relies on physicians to regulate themselves. Colleagues of an impaired physician should take steps to protect patients and help their impaired colleague, starting with reporting their concerns to their clinical supervisor or director. \n\n## ETHICAL ISSUES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH \n\n Clinical research is essential to translate scientific discoveries into beneficial interventions for patients. However, clinical research raises ethical concerns because participants face inconvenience and risks in research designed to advance scientific knowledge and not specifically to benefit them. Ethical guidelines require researchers to rigorously design and conduct research, minimize risk to participants, and obtain informed and voluntary consent from participants and approval from an institutional review board (IRB). IRBs determine that risks to participants are acceptable and have been minimized and recommend appropriate additional protections when research includes vulnerable participants. Physicians may be clinical research investigators themselves or may be in a position to refer or recommend clinical trial participation to their patients. Physician-investigators are likely to feel some inherent tension between conducting research and providing health care. Awareness of this tension, familiarity with research ethics, collaboration with research and clinical team members, and utilizing research ethics consultation can help to mitigate tensions. Before starting clinical research, investigators should complete training in the ethics of clinical research, which is widely available. Physicians also should be critical consumers of clinical research results and keep up with research advances that change standards of practice. Precision medicine initiatives aim to individualize clinical care by combining clinical information from electronic health records, genomic sequencing, and data from personal mobile devices. Furthermore, physicians and health care institutions are analyzing data routinely collected and available in electronic health records, leftover clinical specimens, and administrative data. Such studies encompass traditional discovery research as well as quality improvement, comparative effectiveness research, and learning health care systems. Efforts to improve the quality of care in real-world clinical settings are important but also raise new issues about informed consent, privacy, and risk. \n\n## EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES \n\n Scientific advances in genome sequencing, gene editing (e.g., with CRISPR-Cas9), machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer– brain interfaces, and other technologies offer great promise for research and clinical care with the ultimate goal of improving the prediction, prevention, and treatment of disease. Groundbreaking innovations that have strong scientific plausibility need to be evaluated in rigorous clinical studies for efficacy and safety. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n Physicians should keep up to date on the status of novel and often complex technologies as research evolves, data emerge, and technologies are incorporated into clinical practice. They can help their patients understand research findings and the evidence for clinical use, correct any misunderstandings, facilitate shared decision-making, and advocate for fair access to such therapies. Further, physicians should engage in professional and public discussion related to allocation of resources and fair access to expensive new therapies and emerging technologies and their impact on overall health care affordability. Certain cell-based therapies, such as peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (Chap. 114) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy (Chap. 69) , are approved for use in several serious hematologic cancers, and gene therapies have been approved as safe and effective for clinical use in certain serious inherited diseases and cancers. Patients may request these and other complex, highly technical, and expensive therapies for unproven indications. Yet, claims of cures through unproven stem cell or gene-based “therapies” pose significant health and financial risks to patients without evidence of benefit. Physicians should help patients distinguish approved therapies from unproven claims and refer interested patients to well-designed clinical trials. Medical applications of CRISPR-Cas9 are promising, and their safety and efficacy for particular clinical conditions are being carefully evaluated in clinical trials. Applications of CRISPR genome editing in somatic cells to modify or correct problematic genes could lay the foundation for treating a variety of serious diseases, including blood disorders, HIV, cancer, and hereditary blindness. Germline gene editing in blastocysts or embryos raises many ethical questions and is currently not permitted in the United States in clinical trials or clinical practice. In artificial intelligence (AI), computers carry out tasks typically done by humans. Machine learning (ML) is a type of AI that automatically learns and improves its performance without explicit programming. Clinical algorithms using AI and ML can make diagnoses from radiology images, retinal scans, or skin photographs and identify patients at increased risk for surgical complications, critical care, or hospital readmission. However, such algorithms can also pose risks. Bias may occur if an algorithm was derived or validated from a data set in which groups who suffer from health disparities or poor health outcomes are underrepresented or if the algorithm predicts outcomes that are not clinically meaningful. To address these ethical concerns, researchers should assess AI algorithms in well-designed randomized clinical trials with clinical endpoints. Institutions should integrate validated and unbiased algorithms into clinical workflow without unduly burdening physicians and nurses and should check effectiveness and safety in their particular settings and patient populations. Physicians should stay informed of emerging evidence about such technologies and the ethical challenges that accompany their use and always keep their patients’ best interests and preferences at the forefront. \n\n## GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS \n\n#### ■ INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH \n\n Clinical research is often conducted across multiple sites and across national borders. Societal, legal, and cultural norms and perspectives about research may vary, and there are many ethical challenges. Physician-investigators involved in international research should be familiar with international guidelines, such as the Declaration of Helsinki, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) guidelines, and the International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, as well as national and local laws where research is taking place. Partnering with local researchers and communities is essential not only to demonstrate respect but also to facilitate successful clinical research. \n\n#### ■ INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL EXPERIENCES \n\n Many physicians and trainees gain valuable experience providing patient care in international settings through international training opportunities or volunteering for humanitarian or other international \n\n clinical work. Such arrangements, however, raise ethical challenges— for example, as a result of differences in beliefs about health and illness, expectations regarding health care and physicians’ roles, standards of clinical practice, resource limitations, and norms for disclosure of serious diagnoses. Additional dilemmas arise if visiting physicians and trainees take on responsibilities beyond their expertise or if donated drugs and equipment are not appropriate to local needs. Visiting physicians and trainees should prepare well for these experiences, receive training and mentoring, learn about cultural and clinical practices in the host community, respect local customs and values, collaborate closely with local professionals and staff, and be explicit and humble about their own skills, knowledge, and limits. Leaders of global health field experiences should ensure that participating physicians receive training on ethical and cultural issues, as well as mentoring, backup, and debriefing upon return home. \n\n#### ■ CONCLUSION \n\n Ethical issues are common in clinical medicine and occur in circumstances that may be foreseeable, novel, or unexpected. Physicians address these ethical issues by being prepared, informed, and thoughtful and using appropriate available resources. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\n Beauchamp T, Childress J: Principles of Biomedical Ethics, 8th ed.

Approximately 74% of these deaths occurred in those aged ≥65 years. The epidemiology of death has changed significantly since 1900 and even since 1980. In 1900, heart disease caused ~8% of all deaths, and cancer accounted for \u003c4% of all deaths. In 1980, heart disease accounted for 38.2% of all deaths, cancer 20.9%, and cerebrovascular disease 8.6% of all deaths. By 2019, there had been a dramatic drop in deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In 2019, 23.1% of all deaths were from cardiovascular disease and just 5.3% from cerebrovascular disease. Deaths attributable to cancer, however, had increased slightly to 21.0%. The proportions of deaths due to chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and suicide have increased. Interestingly, in 2019, HIV/AIDS accounted for \u003c0.18% of all U.S. deaths. While unlikely to continue being a leading cause of death in the future, COVID-19 was also the cause for \u003e600,000 deaths in 2020–2021, and the official figure is almost certainly an undercount of the actual death toll. \n\n# 12 \n\n## Palliative and \n\n## End-of-Life Care \n\n Ezekiel J.

In the United States, ~84% of all health care spending goes to patients with chronic illnesses, and 12% of total personal health care spending—slightly less than $400 billion in 2015—goes to the 0.83% of the population in the last year of their lives. In upper-middleand upper-income countries, an estimated 70% of all deaths are preceded by a disease or condition, making it reasonable to plan for dying in the foreseeable future. Cancer has served as the paradigm for terminal care, but it is not the only type of illness with a recognizable and predictable terminal phase. Since heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic liver failure, dementia, and many other conditions have recognizable terminal phases, a systematic approach to end-of-life care should be part of all medical specialties. Many patients with chronic illness–related symptoms and suffering also can benefit from palliative care regardless of prognosis. Ideally, palliative care should be considered part of comprehensive care for all chronically ill patients. Strong evidence demonstrates that palliative care can be improved by coordination between caregivers, doctors, and patients for advance care planning, as well as dedicated teams of physicians, nurses, and other providers. \n\n#### ■ SITE OF DEATH \n\n Where patients die varies by country. In Belgium and Canada, for instance, over half of all cancer patients still die in the hospital. The past few decades have seen a steady shift, both in the United States and other countries like the Netherlands, out of the hospital, as patients and their families list their own homes as the preferred site of death. In the early 1980s, ~70% of American cancer patients died in the hospital. Today, that percentage is ~25% (Fig. 12-1). A recent report shows that since 2000, there has been a shift in the United States from inpatient to home deaths, especially for patients with cancer, COPD, and dementia. For instance, among Medicare beneficiaries, 30.1% of deaths due to cancer in 2000 occurred in acute care hospitals; by 2009, this figure had dropped to 22.1%; by 2015, it was 19.8%. Paradoxically, while deaths in acute care hospitals have declined in the United States since 2000, both hospitalizations in the last 90 days of life and—even more troublingly—admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the last 30 days have actually increased. Over 40% of cancer patients in the United States are admitted to the ICU in their last 6 months of life, and \u003e25% of cancer patients are admitted to the hospital in the last 30 days. \n\n 0.00 \n\n 5.00 \n\n 10.00 \n\n 15.00 \n\n 20.00 \n\n 25.00 \n\n 30.00 \n\n 35.00 \n\n 40.00 \n\n 45.00 \n\n 50.00 \n\n 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 \n\n Decedents, % \n\n Year \n\n Inpatient Hospice facility Decedent’s home \n\n**FIGURE 12-1 Graph showing trends in cancer decedents’ site of death 1999–2019.** (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2019 on CDC WONDER Online Database. [http://wonder.cdc.gov.)](http://wonder.cdc.gov.)) \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n The shift in deaths out of the hospital has been accompanied by an increase in the use of hospice in the United States. In 2000, 21.6% of Medicare decedents used hospice at the time of death; by 2009, 42.2% were using hospice; and by 2018, 50.7% of Medicare decedents were enrolled in hospice at the time of death. Among cancer patients, ~60% were using hospice at the time of death. Hospice is also increasingly being used by noncancer patients. Today, cancer patients constitute ~20% of hospice users. But since 2014, the proportion of patients with other diagnoses using hospice has grown substantially, including those with circulatory/heart disease (17.4% in 2018 vs 13.8% in 2014), stroke (9.5% vs 6.2%), and respiratory disease (11.0% vs 9.4%). Of 2018 Medicare hospice decedents, 51.5% died at home, 17.4% in a nursing facility, 12.8% in a hospice inpatient facility, and 12.3% in assisted living. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities exist in end-of-life care and the use of hospice, especially for noncancer deaths. Racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to receive hospice services than white decedents and are more likely to receive invasive or aggressive care in end-of-life treatment. Of people who died of head and neck cancers between 1999 and 2017, African Americans and Asians/Pacific Islanders were less likely to die at home or in hospice. Among Medicare beneficiaries who had a pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer and lived at least 30 days, racial and ethnic minority patients remained 22% less likely than white patients to initiate hospice before death. In 2008, for the first time, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) offered certification in hospice and palliative medicine. With the shortening of hospital stays, many serious conditions are now being treated at home or on an outpatient basis. Consequently, providing optimal palliative and end-of-life care requires ensuring that appropriate services are available in a variety of settings, including noninstitutional settings. \n\n## HOSPICE AND THE PALLIATIVE CARE \n\n## FRAMEWORK \n\n Central to this type of care is an interdisciplinary team approach that typically encompasses pain and symptom management, spiritual and psychological care for the patient, and support for family caregivers during the patient’s illness and the bereavement period. One of the more important changes in this field is beginning palliative care many months before death in order to focus on symptom relief and then switching to hospice in the patient’s last few months. This approach avoids leaving hospice until the very end by introducing palliative care earlier, thereby allowing patients and families time to accommodate and transition. Phasing palliative care into end-of-life care means that patients will often receive palliative interventions long before they are formally diagnosed as terminally ill, or likely to die within 6 months. Fundamental to ensuring quality palliative and end-of-life care is a focus on four broad domains: (1) physical symptoms; (2) psychological symptoms; (3) social needs that include interpersonal relationships, caregiving, and economic concerns; and (4) existential or spiritual needs. \n\n#### ■ ASSESSMENT AND CARE PLANNING \n\n#### Comprehensive Assessment Standardized methods for con\n\n ducting a comprehensive assessment focus on evaluating the patient’s condition in all four domains affected by the illness: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. A comprehensive assessment should follow a modified version of the traditional medical history and physical examination and should emphasize both physical and mental symptoms. Questions should aim to elucidate symptoms, discern sources of suffering, and gauge how much those symptoms interfere with the patient’s quality of life. Standardized and repeated assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions are critical. Thus, clinicians should use shorter, validated instruments, such as (1) the revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale; (2) Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS); (3) MD Anderson Brief Symptom Inventory; (4) Rotterdam Symptom Checklist; (5) Symptom Distress Scale; (6) Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; and (7) Interactive Symptom Assessment and Collection (ISAAC) tool. \n\n MENTAL HEALTH With respect to mental health, many practices use the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to screen for anxiety. Using such tools ensures that the assessment is comprehensive and does not focus excessively on only pain. INVASIVE TESTS Invasive tests are best avoided in end-of-life care, and even minimally invasive tests should be evaluated carefully for their benefit-to-burden ratio for the patient. Aspects of the physical examination that are uncomfortable and unlikely to yield useful information that change patient management should be omitted. SOCIAL NEEDS Health care providers should also assess the status of important relationships, financial burdens, caregiving needs, and access to medical care. Relevant questions include the following: How often is there someone to feel close to? How has this illness been for your family? How has it affected your relationships? How much help do you need with things like getting meals and getting around? How much trouble do you have getting the medical care you need? EXISTENTIAL NEEDS To determine a patient’s existential needs, providers should assess distress, the patient’s sense of emotional and existential well-being, and whether the patient believes he or she has found purpose or meaning. Helpful assessment questions can include the following: How much are you able to find meaning since your illness began? What things are most important to you at this stage? PERCEPTION OF CARE In addition, it can be helpful to ask how the patient perceives his or her care: How much do you feel your doctors and nurses respect you? How clear is the information from us about what to expect regarding your illness? How much do you feel that the medical care you are getting fits with your goals? If concern is detected in any of these areas, deeper evaluative questions are warranted. \n\n#### Communication Particularly when an illness is life-threatening, \n\n there exists the potential for many emotionally charged and potentially conflict-creating moments—collectively called “bad news” situations— in which empathic and effective communication skills are essential. Those moments include the sharing of a terminal diagnosis with the patient and/or family, the discussion of the patient’s prognosis and any treatment failures, the consideration of deemphasizing efforts to cure and prolong life while focusing more on symptom management and palliation, advance care planning, and the patient’s actual death. Although these conversations can be difficult, research indicates that end-of-life discussions can lead to earlier hospice referrals, rather than overly aggressive treatment, ultimately benefiting quality of life for patients and improving the bereavement process for families. Just as surgeons prepare for major operations and investigators rehearse a presentation of research results, physicians and health care providers caring for patients with significant or advanced illnesses should develop a standardized approach for sharing important information and planning interventions. In addition, physicians must be aware that families often care not only about how prepared the physician was to deliver bad news, but also the setting in which it was delivered. For instance, one study found that 27% of families making critical decisions for patients in an ICU desired better and more private physical space to communicate with physicians. One structured seven-step procedure for communicating bad news goes by the acronym P-SPIKES: (1) p repare for the discussion, (2) s et up a suitable environment, (3) begin the discussion by finding out what the p atient and/or family understand, (4) determine how they will comprehend new i nformation best and how much they want to know, (5) provide needed new k nowledge accordingly, (6) allow for e motional responses, and (7) s hare plans for the next steps in care (Table 12-2). \n\n#### Continuous Goal Assessment Major barriers to providing \n\n high-quality palliative and end-of-life care include the difficulty in determining an accurate prognosis and the emotional resistance of patients and their families to accepting the implications of a poor prognosis. A practical solution to these barriers is to integrate palliative care interventions or home visits from a palliative care visiting nurse months before the estimated final 6 months of life. Under this \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\n TABLE 12-2 Elements of Communicating Bad News—The P-SPIKES Approach ACRONYM STEPS AIM OF THE INTERACTION PREPARATIONS, QUESTIONS, OR PHRASES P Preparation Mentally prepare for the interaction with the patient and/or family. \n\n Review what information needs to be communicated. Plan how you will provide emotional support. Rehearse key steps and phrases in the interaction. S Setting of the interaction \n\n Ensure the appropriate setting for a serious and potentially emotionally charged discussion. \n\n Ensure that patient, family, and appropriate social supports are present. Devote sufficient time. Ensure privacy and prevent interruptions by people or beeper. Bring a box of tissues. P Patient’s perception and preparation \n\n Begin the discussion by establishing the baseline and whether the patient and family can grasp the information. Ease tension by having the patient and family contribute. \n\n Start with open-ended questions to encourage participation. Possible questions to use: What do you understand about your illness? When you first had symptom X, what did you think it might be? What did Dr. X tell you when he or she sent you here? What do you think is going to happen? I Invitation and information needs \n\n Discover what information needs the patient and/or family have and what limits they want regarding the bad information. \n\n Possible questions to use: If this condition turns out to be something serious, do you want to know? Would you like me to tell you all the details of your condition? If not, who would you like me to talk to? K Knowledge of the condition \n\n Provide the bad news or other information to the patient and/or family sensitively. \n\n Do not just dump the information on the patient and family. Check for patient and family understanding. Possible phrases to use: I feel badly to have to tell you this, but... Unfortunately, the tests showed... I’m afraid the news is not good... E Empathy and exploration \n\n Identify the cause of the emotions— e.g., poor prognosis. Empathize with the patient’s and/or family’s feelings. Explore by asking open-ended questions. \n\n Strong feelings in reaction to bad news are normal. Acknowledge what the patient and family are feeling. Remind them such feelings are normal, even if frightening. Give them time to respond. Remind the patient and family you won’t abandon them. Possible phrases to use: I imagine this is very hard for you to hear. You look very upset. Tell me how you are feeling. I wish the news were different. We’ll do whatever we can to help you. S Summary and planning \n\n Delineate for the patient and the family the next steps, including additional tests or interventions. \n\n It is the unknown and uncertain that can increase anxiety. Recommend a schedule with goals and landmarks. Provide your rationale for the patient and/or family to accept (or reject). If the patient and/or family are not ready to discuss the next steps, schedule a follow-up visit. \n\nSource: Adapted from R Buckman: How to Break Bad News: A Guide for Health Care Professionals. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992. \n\napproach, palliative care no longer conveys the message of failure, having no more treatments, or “giving up hope.” The transition from palliative to end-of-life care or hospice also feels less hasty and unexpected to the family. Fundamental to integrating palliative care with curative therapy is the inclusion of a continuous goal assessment as part of the routine patient reassessments that occur at most patientphysician encounters. Goals for care are numerous, ranging from curing a specific disease, to prolonging life, to relieving a particular symptom, to adapting to a progressive disability without disrupting the family, to finding peace of mind or personal meaning, to dying in a manner that leaves loved ones with positive memories. Discerning a patient’s goals for care can be approached through a seven-step protocol: (1) ensure that medical and other information is as complete as reasonably possible and is understood by all relevant parties (see above); (2) explore what the patient and/or family is hoping for, while also identifying relevant and realistic goals; (3) share all the options with the patient and family; (4) respond with empathy as they adjust to changing expectations; (5) make a plan that emphasizes what can be done to achieve the realistic goals; (6) follow through with the plan; and (7) periodically review the plan and consider at every encounter whether the goals of care should be revised with the patient and/or family. Each of these steps need not be followed in rote order, but together they provide a helpful framework for interactions with patients and their families regarding \n\n their goals for care. Such interactions can be especially challenging if a patient or family member has difficulty letting go of an unrealistic goal. In such cases, the provider should help them refocus on more realistic goals and should also suggest that while it is fine to hope for the best, it is still prudent to plan for other outcomes as well. \n\n#### Advance Care Planning * PRACTICES Advance care planning \n\n is the process of planning for future medical care in case the patient becomes incapable of making medical decisions. A 2010 study of adults aged ≥60 who died between 2000 and 2006 found that while 42% of adults were required to make treatment decisions in their final days of life, 70% lacked decision-making capacity. Among those lacking decision-making capacity, approximately one-third did not have advance planning directives. Ideally, such planning would occur before a health care crisis or the terminal phase of an illness. Unfortunately, diverse barriers prevent this. Approximately 80% of Americans endorse advance care planning and living wills. However, according to a 2013 Pew survey, only 35% of adults have written down their end-of-life wishes. Other studies report that even fewer Americans—with some estimates as low as 26% of adults—have filled out advance care directives. A review of studies suggests that the percentage of Americans who had written advance directives did not change between 2011 and 2016 and remains slightly over one-third of Americans. Larger numbers of adults, between 50 and 70%, claim to have talked with someone \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n about their treatment wishes. Americans aged 65 and older are more likely to complete an advance directive compared to younger adults (46% vs 32%). Effective advance care planning should follow six key steps: (1) introducing the topic, (2) structuring a discussion, (3) reviewing plans that have been discussed by the patient and family, (4) documenting the plans, (5) updating them periodically, and (6) implementing the advance care directives (Table 12-3). Two of the main barriers to advance care planning are problems in raising the topic and difficulty in structuring a succinct discussion. Raising the topic can be done efficiently as a routine matter, noting that it is recommended for all patients, analogous to purchasing insurance or estate planning. Many of the most difficult cases have involved unexpected, acute episodes of brain damage in young individuals. Structuring a focused discussion is an important communication skill. To do so, a provider must first identify the health care proxy and recommend his or her involvement in the advance care planning process. Next, a worksheet must be selected that has been demonstrated to produce reliable and valid expressions of patient preferences, and the patient and proxy must be oriented to it. Such worksheets exist for both general and disease-specific situations. The provider should then discuss with the patient and proxy one example scenario to demonstrate how to think about the issues. It is often helpful to begin with a scenario in which the patient is likely to have settled preferences for care, such as being in a persistent vegetative state. Once the patient’s preferences \n\n for interventions in this scenario are determined, the provider should suggest that the patient and proxy discuss and complete the worksheet for each other. If appropriate, the patient and proxy should consider involving other family members in the discussion. During a subsequent return visit, the provider should go over the patient’s preferences, checking and resolving any inconsistencies. After having the patient and proxy sign the document, the provider should place the document in the patient’s medical chart and make sure that copies are provided to relevant family members and care sites. Since patients’ preferences can change, these documents must be reviewed periodically. \n\n TYPES OF DOCUMENTS Advance care planning documents are of two broad types. The first includes living wills, also known as instructional directives; these are advisory documents that describe the types of decisions that should direct a patient’s care. Some are more specific, delineating different scenarios and interventions for the patient to choose from. Among these, some are for general use and others are designed for use by patients with a specific type of disease, such as cancer, renal failure, or HIV. Less specific directives can be general statements, such as not wanting life-sustaining interventions, or forms that describe the values that should guide specific discussions about terminal care. The second type of advance directive allows the designation of a health care proxy (sometimes also referred to as a durable attorney for health care), an individual selected by the patient to make decisions. The choice is not either/or; a combined directive that includes a living \n\n TABLE 12-3 Steps in Advance Care Planning STEP GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED AND MEASURES TO COVER USEFUL PHRASES OR POINTS TO MAKE Introduce advance care planning \n\n Ask the patient what he or she knows about advance care planning and if he or she has already completed an advance care directive. \n\n I’d like to talk with you about something I try to discuss with all my patients. It’s called advance care planning. In fact, I feel that this is such an important topic that I have done this myself. Are you familiar with advance care planning or living wills? Indicate that you as a physician have completed advance care planning. \n\n Have you thought about the type of care you would want if you ever became too sick to speak for yourself? That is the purpose of advance care planning. Indicate that you try to perform advance care planning with all patients regardless of prognosis. \n\n There is no change in health that we have not discussed. I am bringing this up now because it is sensible for everyone, no matter how well or ill, old or young. Explain the goals of the process as empowering the patient and ensuring that you and the proxy understand the patient’s preferences. \n\n Have many copies of advance care directives available, including in the waiting room, for patients and families. Provide the patient relevant literature, including the advance care directive that you prefer to use. \n\n Know resources for state-specific forms (available at http://www.nhpco. org). Recommend the patient identify a proxy decision-maker who should attend the next meeting. Have a structured discussion of scenarios with the patient \n\n Affirm that the goal of the process is to follow the patient’s wishes if the patient loses decision-making capacity. \n\n Use a structured worksheet with typical scenarios. \n\n Elicit the patient’s overall goals related to health care. Elicit the patient’s preferences for specific interventions in a few salient and common scenarios. Help the patient define the threshold for withdrawing and withholding interventions. Define the patient’s preference for the role of the proxy. \n\n Begin the discussion with persistent vegetative state and consider other scenarios, such as recovery from an acute event with serious disability; then ask the patient about his or her preferences regarding specific interventions, such as ventilators, artificial nutrition, and CPR; finally, proceeding to less invasive interventions, such as blood transfusions and antibiotics. \n\n Review the patient’s preferences \n\n After the patient has made choices of interventions, review them to ensure they are consistent and the proxy is aware of them. Document the patient’s preferences \n\n Formally complete the advance care directive and have a witness sign it. Provide a copy for the patient and the proxy. Insert a copy into the patient’s medical record and summarize it in a progress note. Update the directive Periodically, and with major changes in health status, review the directive with the patient and make any modifications. Apply the directive The directive goes into effect only when the patient becomes unable to make medical decisions for himself or herself. Reread the directive to be sure about its content. Discuss your proposed actions based on the directive with the proxy. Abbreviation: CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\nwill and designates a proxy is often used, and the directive should indicate clearly whether the specified patient preferences or the proxy’s choice takes precedence if they conflict. Some states have begun to put into practice a “Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)” directive, which builds on communication between providers and patients by including guidance for end-of-life care in a color-coordinated form that follows the patient across treatment settings. The procedures for completing advance care planning documents vary according to state law. A potentially misleading distinction relates to statutory, as opposed to advisory, documents. Statutory documents are drafted to fulfill relevant state laws. Advisory documents are drafted to reflect the patient’s wishes. Both are legal, the former under state law and the latter under common or constitutional law. \n\n**LEGAL ASPECTS** As of 2021, 48 states and the District of Columbia had enacted living will legislation. Massachusetts and Michigan are the two states without living will legislation. Indiana has a life-prolonging procedures declaration. States differ in the requirements for advanced directives, including whether they need to be witnessed and, if so, by how many witnesses and whether they need to be notarized. Importantly, in 25 states, the laws state that the living will is not valid if a woman is pregnant. All states except Alaska have enacted durable power of attorney for health care laws that permit patients to designate a proxy decision-maker with authority to terminate life-sustaining treatments. Only in Alaska does the law prohibit proxies from terminating life-sustaining treatments for pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that patients have a constitutional right to decide any issues related to refusing or terminating medical interventions, including life-sustaining interventions, and that mentally incompetent patients can exercise this right by providing “clear and convincing evidence” of their preferences. Since advance care directives permit patients to provide such evidence, commentators agree that they are constitutionally protected. Most commentators believe that a state is required to honor any clear advance care directive, regardless of whether it is written on an “official” form. Many states have enacted laws for the explicit purpose of honoring out-of-state directives. If a patient is not using a statutory form, it may be advisable to attach a statutory form to the advance care directive being used. State-specific forms are readily available free of charge for health care providers, patients, and families through the website of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (http://www.nhpco.org). \n\n**REIMBURSEMENT** As of January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services amended the physician fee schedule to reimburse discussions of advance care planning under Current Procedural Terminology codes 99497 and 99498. The session must be voluntary and include an explanation of advance care planning but need not include a completed advance care document. There can be multiple bills for the discussion if it extends over several encounters. A study found that patients who engaged in a billed advance care planning encounter were more likely to be enrolled in hospice and less likely to receive intensive therapies, despite being more likely to be hospitalized in the ICU. However, a billing incentive in and of itself may not increase advance care planning discussions by clinicians. In 2016, just 1.6% of Medicare Advantage patients had a discussion of advance care planning that was billed. Factors beyond reimbursement, such as clinicians’ lack of comfort and skill in carrying out advance care planning discussions and lack of time, appear to impede discussions of advance care planning. \n\n## INTERVENTIONS \n\n#### ■ PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT \n\nGreat emphasis has been placed on addressing dying patients’ pain. In order to emphasize its importance, pain assessment has frequently been included as the fifth vital sign. Heightened consideration of pain has been advocated by large health care systems such as the Veterans’ Administration and accrediting bodies such as The Joint Commission. Although this embrace of pain has been symbolically important, \n\n available data suggest that making pain the fifth vital sign does not lead to improved pain management practices. In light of the opioid crisis in the United States, the emphasis on pain management has begun to be reexamined. For instance, in 2017 draft standards, The Joint Commission recommends nonpharmacologic pain treatment as well as identification of psychosocial risk factors for addiction. Importantly, good palliative care requires much more than good pain management. The frequency of symptoms varies by disease and other factors. The most common physical and psychological symptoms among all terminally ill patients include pain, fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, dyspnea, depression, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. In the last days of life, terminal delirium is also common. Assessments of patients with advanced cancer have shown that patients experienced an average of 11.5 different physical and psychological symptoms (Table 12-4). In the vast majority of cases, evaluations to determine the etiology of these symptoms should be limited to the history and physical examination. In some cases, radiologic or other diagnostic examinations will provide sufficient benefit in directing optimal palliative care to warrant the risks, potential discomfort, and inconvenience, especially to a seriously ill patient. Only a few of the common symptoms that present difficult management issues will be addressed in this chapter. Additional information on the management of other symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, insomnia, and diarrhea, can be found in Chaps. 45, 31, and 46, respectively. Information on the management of patients with cancer is provided in Chap. 69. \n\n#### Pain * FREQUENCY The frequency of pain among terminally ill \n\n patients varies significantly. Cancer (~85%), congestive heart failure (CHF; ~75%), and AIDS have been associated with a higher prevalence of pain compared to other advanced illnesses, such as COPD (~45%), chronic kidney disease (~40%), and dementia (~40%). One meta-analysis of adults with advanced or terminal illness found pain prevalence of 30–94% in patients with cancer, compared to 21–77% for COPD, 14–78% for CHF, 11–83% for end-stage renal disease, 14–63% for dementia, and 30–98% for AIDS. ETIOLOGY There are two types of pain: nociceptive and neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is further divided into somatic or visceral pain. Somatic pain is the result of direct mechanical or chemical stimulation of nociceptors and normal neural signaling to the brain. It tends to be localized, aching, throbbing, and cramping. The classic example is bone metastases. Visceral pain is caused by nociceptors in gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, and other organ systems. It is a deep or colicky type of pain classically associated with pancreatitis, myocardial infarction, or tumor invasion of viscera. Neuropathic pain arises from \n\n TABLE 12-4 Common Physical and Psychological Symptoms of Terminally Ill Patients PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS Pain Anxiety Fatigue and weakness Depression Dyspnea Hopelessness Insomnia Meaninglessness Dry mouth Irritability Anorexia Impaired concentration Nausea and vomiting Confusion Constipation Delirium Cough Loss of libido Swelling of arms or legs Itching Diarrhea Dysphagia Dizziness Fecal and urinary incontinence Numbness/tingling in hands/feet \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n disordered nerve signals. It is described by patients as burning, electrical, or shock-like pain. Classic examples are post-stroke pain, tumor invasion of the brachial plexus, and herpetic neuralgia. ASSESSMENT Pain is a subjective experience. Depending on the patient’s circumstances, perspective, and physiologic condition, the same physical lesion or disease state can produce different levels of reported pain and need for pain relief. Systematic assessment includes eliciting the following: (1) type: throbbing, cramping, burning, etc.; (2) periodicity: continuous, with or without exacerbations, or incident; (3) location; (4) intensity; (5) modifying factors; (6) effects of treatments; (7) functional impact; and (8) impact on patient. Several validated pain assessment measures may be used, including the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), or the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS-11). Other scales have been developed for neuropathic pain, such as the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the DN4 Questionnaire. Frequent reassessments on a consistent scale are essential to assess the impact of and need to readjust interventions. INTERVENTIONS Interventions for pain must be tailored to each individual, with the goal of preempting chronic pain and relieving breakthrough pain. At the end of life, there is rarely reason to doubt a patient’s report of pain. With the opioid crisis in the United States, there is more emphasis on making opioids one component of multimodal analgesia. Nevertheless, at the end of life, pain medications, especially opioids, remain the cornerstone of management (Fig. 12-2). If they are failing and nonpharmacologic interventions—including radiotherapy and anesthetic or neurosurgical procedures such as peripheral nerve blocks or epidural medications—are required, a pain consultation is appropriate. Pharmacologic interventions still largely follow the World Health Organization three-step, “analgesic ladder” approach, which involves nonopioid analgesics, “mild” opioids, and “strong” opioids, with or without adjuvants (Chap. 13). Nonopioid analgesics, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are the initial treatments for mild pain. They work primarily by inhibiting peripheral prostaglandins \n\n and reducing inflammation but may also have central nervous system (CNS) effects. Additionally, NSAIDs have a ceiling effect. Ibuprofen, up to 2400 mg/d qid, has a minimal risk of causing bleeding and renal impairment and is a good initial choice. In patients with a history of severe GI or other bleeding, however, ibuprofen should be avoided. In patients with a history of mild gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), acid-lowering therapy, such as a proton pump inhibitor, should be used. Acetaminophen is an alternative in patients with a history of GI bleeding and can be used safely at up to 4 g/d qid. In patients with liver dysfunction due to metastases or other causes and in patients with heavy alcohol use, doses should be reduced. If nonopioid analgesics are insufficient, opioids should be introduced. Opioids primarily work by interacting with μ opioid receptors to activate pain-inhibitory neurons in the CNS, although they also interact variably with δ and κ receptors. Receptor agonists, such as morphine, codeine, and fentanyl, produce analgesia by activating pain-inhibitory neurons in the CNS. Partial agonists, such as buprenorphine, have a ceiling effect for analgesia and a lower potential for abuse. They are useful for postacute pain but should not be used for chronic pain in end-of-life care. Pure antagonists, such as naloxone and methylnaltrexone, are used for reversal of opioid effects. Traditionally, “weak” opioids such as codeine were used first. If they failed to relieve pain after dose escalation, “strong” opioids like morphine were used in doses of 5–10 mg every 4 h. However, this breakdown between “weak” and “strong” opioids is no longer commonly accepted, with smaller doses of “stronger” opioids frequently being preferred over similar or larger doses of “weaker” opioids, and different pain syndromes having different preferred therapies. Regardless, nonopioid analgesics should be combined with opioids, as they potentiate the effect of opioids. Importantly, the goal is to prevent patients from experiencing pain. Consequently, for continuous pain, opioids should be administered on a regular, around-the-clock basis consistent with their duration of analgesia, and the next dose should occur before the effect of the previous dose wears off. They should not be provided only when the patient \n\n MILD PAIN Acetaminophen: 500 mg 2 tablets every 4–6 h Ibuprofen: 400 mg every 6 h; max 8 tablets per day (2400 mg/d qid) \n\n MODERATE PAIN Codeine: 30–60 mg every 4–8 h; maximum daily dose for pain 240 mg Tramadol: 25 mg PO every 6 h; max 400 mg/d Add to acetaminophen, NSAIDs \n\n SEVERE PAIN Morphine: 2.5–5 mg every 3–6 h orally Hydromorphone: 1–2 mg every 3–6 h orally Fentanyl transdermal: 1000-μg patch for 72 h Hydrocodone: 5–10 mg every 3–6 h orally Add to acetaminophen, NSAIDs \n\n Pain persists or increases \n\n Difficult to Control Pain \n\n Specialist Consultation (Consideration of surgical procedures such as nerve blocks) \n\n Pain persists or increases \n\n NEUROPATHIC PAIN burning, electrical, shock-like \n\n e.g., poststroke pain, tumor invasion of brachial plexus, herpetic neuralgia \n\n Treatment Gabapentin: 100–300 mg bid or tid, with 50–100% dose increments every 3 days; 3600 mg/d in 2 or 3 days \n\n NOCICEPTIVE PAIN cramping, throbbing, aching, sharp, prickling, stabbing, deep and constant, dull and gnawing \n\n e.g., pancreatitis, bone metastases, tumor invasion, obstruction (of ureters, colon, gastric outlet, gallbladder, etc.) \n\n Treatment NSAIDs or acetaminophen with opioids \n\n FIGURE 12-2 Terminal pain management flow chart.

Patients should also be provided rescue medication, such as liquid morphine, for breakthrough pain, generally at 20% of the baseline dose. Patients should be informed that using the rescue medication does not obviate the need to take the next standard dose of pain medication. If the patient’s pain remains uncontrolled after 24 h and recurs before the next dose, requiring the patient to utilize the rescue medication, the daily opioid dose can be increased by the total dose of rescue medications used by the patient, or by 50% of the standing opioid daily dose for moderate pain and 100% for severe pain. It is inappropriate to start with extended-release preparations. Instead, an initial focus on using short-acting preparations to determine how much is required in the first 24–48 h will allow clinicians to determine opioid needs. Once pain relief is obtained using short-acting preparations, the switch should be made to extended-release preparations. Even with a stable extended-release preparation regimen, the patient may experience incident pain, such as during movement or dressing changes. Short-acting preparations should be taken before such predictable episodes. Although less common, patients may have “end-of-dose failure” with long-acting opioids, meaning that they develop pain after 8 h in the case of an every-12-h medication. In these cases, a trial of giving an every-12-h medication every 8 h is appropriate. Due to differences in opioid receptors, cross-tolerance among opioids is incomplete, and patients may experience different side effects with different opioids. Therefore, if a patient is not experiencing pain relief or is experiencing too many side effects, a change to another opioid preparation is appropriate. When switching, one should begin with 50–75% of the published equianalgesic dose of the new opioid. Unlike NSAIDs, opioids have no ceiling effect; therefore, there is no maximum dose, no matter how many milligrams the patient is receiving. The appropriate dose is the dose needed to achieve pain relief. This is an important point for clinicians to explain to patients and families. Addiction or excessive respiratory depression is extremely unlikely in the terminally ill; fear of these side effects should neither prevent escalating opioid medications when the patient is experiencing insufficient pain relief nor justify using opioid antagonists. Opioid side effects should be anticipated and treated preemptively. Nearly all patients experience constipation that can be debilitating (see below). Failure to prevent constipation often results in noncompliance with opioid therapy. The preferred treatment is prevention. Cathartics (senna 2 tbsp qHS), stool softeners (docusate 100 mg PO qd), and/or laxatives (laxtulose 30 mL qd) are considered first-line treatment. For refractory cases, opioid antagonists or other therapies, such as lubiprostone, should be considered. Methylnaltrexone is the best-studied opioid antagonist for use in refractory opioid-induced constipation. It reverses opioid-induced constipation by blocking peripheral opioid receptors, but not central receptors, for analgesia. In placebo-controlled trials, it has been shown to cause laxation within 24 h of administration. As with the use of opioids, about a third of patients using methylnaltrexone experience nausea and vomiting, but unlike with opioid usage, tolerance usually develops within a week. Therefore, when one is beginning opioids, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or a serotonin antagonist is often prescribed prophylactically and stopped after 1 week. Olanzapine has also been shown to have antinausea properties and can be effective in countering delirium or anxiety, with the advantage of some weight gain. Drowsiness, a common side effect of opioids, also usually abates within a week. For refractory or severe cases, pharmacologic therapy should be considered. The best-studied agents are the psychostimulants dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil, although evidence regarding their efficacy is weak. Modafinil has the advantage of once-a-day dosing compared to methyphenidate’s twice daily dosing. Seriously ill patients who require chronic pain relief rarely become addicted. Suspicion of addiction should not be a reason to withhold pain medications from terminally ill patients. Nonetheless, patients and families may withhold prescribed opioids for fear of addiction or dependence. Physicians and health care providers should reassure patients and families that the patient will not become addicted to \n\n opioids if they are used as prescribed for pain relief; this fear should not prevent the patient from taking the medications around the clock. However, diversion of drugs for use by other family members or illicit sale may occur. It may be necessary to advise the patient and caregiver about secure storage of opioids. Contract writing with the patient and family can help. If that fails, transfer to a safe facility may be necessary. Tolerance describes the need to increase medication dosage for the same pain relief without a concurrent change in disease. In the case of patients with advanced disease, the need for increasing opioid dosage for pain relief usually is caused by disease progression rather than tolerance. Physical dependence is indicated by symptoms resulting from the abrupt withdrawal of opioids and should not be confused with addiction. In recent years, the potential dangers of opioid drugs have become increasingly apparent. To help mitigate the risk of these powerful drugs, several strategies should be used to reduce the risk of aberrant drug use. To start, all patients should be assessed for their individual levels of risk. While there are multiple surveys available, including the Opioid Risk Tool, none have gained widespread use or validation. In general, however, it is important to screen for prior substance abuse and major psychiatric disorders. For patients deemed to be high risk, a multidisciplinary effort should be pursued to reduce the risk of adverse consequences, such as addiction and diversion. Prescribing strategies include selecting opioids with longer durations of action and lower street values, such as methadone, and prescribing smaller quantities with more frequent follow-up. Monitoring options include periodic urine screening and referral to pain specialists. In some cases, it may also be reasonable to consider not offering short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain. In no situation, however, should adequate pain relief be withheld due to risk. Adjuvant analgesic medications are nonopioids that potentiate the analgesic effects of opioids. They are especially important in the management of neuropathic pain. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant initially studied in the setting of herpetic neuralgia, is now the first-line treatment for neuropathic pain resulting from a variety of causes. It is begun at 100–300 mg bid or tid, with 50–100% dose increments every 3 days. Usually 900–3600 mg/d in two or three doses is effective. The combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline may be more effective than gabapentin alone. Two potential side effects of gabapentin to be aware of are confusion and drowsiness, especially in the elderly. Other effective adjuvant medications include pregabalin, which has the same mechanism of action as gabapentin but is absorbed more efficiently from the GI tract. Lamotrigine is a novel agent whose mechanism of action is unknown but has been shown to be effective. It is recommended to begin at 25–50 mg/d, increasing to 100 mg/d. Carbamazepine, a first-generation agent, has been proven effective in randomized trials for neuropathic pain. Other potentially effective anticonvulsant adjuvants include topiramate (25–50 mg qd or bid, rising to 100–300 mg/d) and oxcarbazepine (75–300 mg bid, rising to 1200 mg bid). Glucocorticoids, preferably dexamethasone given once a day, can be useful in reducing inflammation that causes pain, while also elevating mood, energy, and appetite. Its main side effects include confusion, sleep difficulties, and fluid retention. Glucocorticoids are especially effective for bone pain and abdominal pain from distention of the GI tract or liver. Other drugs, including clonidine and baclofen, can be effective in providing pain relief. These drugs are adjuvants and generally should be used in conjunction with—not instead of—opioids. Methadone, carefully dosed because of its unpredictable half-life in many patients, has activity at the N-methyl-D-aspartamate (NMDA) receptor and is useful for complex pain syndromes and neuropathic pain. It is generally reserved for cases in which first-line opioids (morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone) are either ineffective or unavailable. Radiation therapy can treat bone pain from single metastatic lesions. Bone pain from multiple metastases can be amenable to radiopharmaceuticals such as strontium-89 and samarium-153. Bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate (90 mg every 4 weeks) and calcitonin (200 IU intranasally once or twice a day), also provide relief from bone pain but have multiday onsets of action. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n#### Constipation * FREQUENCY Constipation is reported in up to \n\n 70–100% of patients requiring palliative care. ETIOLOGY Although hypercalcemia and other factors can cause constipation, it is most frequently a predictable consequence of the use of opioids for pain and dyspnea relief and of the anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants, as well as due to the inactivity and poor diets common among seriously ill patients. If left untreated, constipation can cause substantial pain and vomiting and also is associated with confusion and delirium. Whenever opioids and other medications known to cause constipation are used, preemptive treatment for constipation should be instituted. ASSESSMENT Assessing constipation can be difficult because people describe it differently. Four commonly used assessment scales are the Bristol Stool Form Scale, the Constipation Assessment Scale, the Constipation Visual Analogue Scale, and the Eton Scale Risk Assessment for Constipation. The Bowel Function Index can be used to quantify opioid-induced constipation. The physician should establish the patient’s previous bowel habits, as well as any changes in subjective and objective qualities such as bloating or decreased frequency. Abdominal and rectal examinations should be performed to exclude impaction or an acute abdomen. Radiographic assessments beyond a simple flat plate of the abdomen in cases in which obstruction is suspected are rarely necessary. INTERVENTION Any measure to address constipation during end-oflife care should include interventions to reestablish comfortable bowel habits and to relieve pain or discomfort. Although physical activity, adequate hydration, and dietary treatments with fiber can be helpful, each is limited in its effectiveness for most seriously ill patients, and fiber may exacerbate problems in the setting of dehydration or if impaired motility is the etiology. Fiber is contraindicated in the presence of opioid use. Stimulant and osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, fluids, and enemas are the mainstays of therapy (Table 12-5). To prevent constipation from opioids and other medications, a combination of a laxative and a stool softener (such as senna and docusate) should be used. If after several days of treatment a bowel movement has not occurred, a rectal examination to remove impacted stool and place a suppository is necessary. For patients with impending bowel \n\n TABLE 12-5 Medications for the Management of Constipation INTERVENTION DOSE COMMENT Stimulant laxatives These agents directly stimulate peristalsis and may reduce colonic absorption of water.

For patients in whom the suspected mechanism is dysmotility, metoclopramide can be helpful. \n\n#### Nausea * FREQUENCY Up to 70% of patients with advanced cancer \n\n have nausea, defined as the subjective sensation of wanting to vomit. ETIOLOGY Nausea and vomiting are both caused by stimulation at one of four sites: the GI tract, the vestibular system, the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and the cerebral cortex. Medical treatments for nausea are aimed at receptors at each of these sites: the GI tract contains mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptors; the vestibular system probably contains histamine and acetylcholine receptors; and the CTZ contains chemoreceptors, dopamine type 2 receptors, and 5-HT3 receptors. An example of nausea that most likely is mediated by the cortex is anticipatory nausea before a dose of chemotherapy or other noxious stimuli. Specific causes of nausea include metabolic changes (liver failure, uremia from renal failure, hypercalcemia), bowel obstruction, constipation, infection, GERD, vestibular disease, brain metastases, medications (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, opioids, and chemotherapy), and radiation therapy. Anxiety can also contribute to nausea. \n\n INTERVENTION Medical treatment of nausea is directed at the anatomic and receptor-mediated cause revealed by a careful history and physical examination. When no specific cause of nausea is identified, many advocate beginning treatment with metoclopramide; a serotonin type 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist such as ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron, dolasetron, tropisetron, or ramosetron; or a dopamine antagonist such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or prochlorperazine. When decreased motility is suspected, metoclopramide can be an effective treatment. When inflammation of the GI tract is suspected, glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, are an appropriate treatment. For nausea that follows chemotherapy and radiation therapy, one of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists or neurokinin-1 antagonists, such as aprepitant or fosaprepitant, is recommended. Clinicians should attempt prevention of postchemotherapy nausea, rather than simply providing treatment after the fact. Current clinical guidelines recommend tailoring the strength of treatments to the specific emetic risk posed by a specific chemotherapy drug. When a vestibular cause (such as “motion sickness” or labyrinthitis) is suspected, antihistamines, such as meclizine (whose primary side effect is drowsiness), or anticholinergics, such as scopolamine, can be effective. In anticipatory nausea, patients can benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions, such as biofeedback and hypnosis. The most common pharmacologic intervention for anticipatory nausea is a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. As with antihistamines, drowsiness and confusion are the main side effects. The use of medical marijuana or oral cannabinoids for palliative treatment of nausea is controversial, as there are no controlled trials showing its effectiveness for patients at the end of life. A 2015 meta-analysis showed “low-quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy,” and such treatments are not as good as 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and can sometimes even cause cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Older patients, who compose the vast majority of dying patients, seem to tolerate cannabinoids poorly. \n\n#### Dyspnea * FREQUENCY Dyspnea is the subjective experience of \n\n being short of breath. Over 50%, and as many as 75%, of dying patients, especially those with lung cancer, metastases to the lung, CHF, and COPD, experience dyspnea at some point near the end of life. Dyspnea is among the most distressing of physical symptoms and can be even more distressing than pain. ASSESSMENT As with pain, dyspnea is a subjective experience that may not correlate with objective measures of PO 2 , PCO 2 , or respiratory rate. Consequently, measurements of oxygen saturation through pulse oximetry or blood gases are rarely helpful in guiding therapy. Despite the limitations of existing assessment methods, physicians should regularly assess and document patients’ experience of dyspnea \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\n TABLE 12-6 Medications for the Management of Dyspnea INTERVENTION DOSE COMMENTS Weak opioids For patients with mild dyspnea Codeine (or codeine with 325 mg acetaminophen) \n\n 30 mg PO q4h For opioid-naïve patients \n\n Hydrocodone 5 mg PO q4h Strong opioids For opioid-naïve patients with moderate to severe dyspnea Morphine 5–10 mg PO q4h For patients already taking opioids for pain or other symptoms 30–50% of baseline opioid dose q4h Oxycodone 5–10 mg PO q4h Hydromorphone 1–2 mg PO q4h Anxiolytics Give a dose every hour until the patient is relaxed; then provide a dose for maintenance Lorazepam 0.5–2.0 mg PO/SL/IV qh then q4–6h Clonazepam 0.25–2.0 mg PO q12h Midazolam 0.5 mg IV q15min \n\n#### Fatigue * FREQUENCY Fatigue is one of the most commonly \n\n reported symptoms not only of cancer treatment but also of the palliative care of multiple sclerosis, COPD, heart failure, and HIV. More than 90% of terminally ill patients experience fatigue and/or weakness. Fatigue is frequently cited as one of the most distressing symptoms in these patients. \n\n ETIOLOGY The multiple causes of fatigue in the terminally ill can be categorized as resulting from the underlying disease; from diseaseinduced factors such as tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines; and from secondary factors such as dehydration, anemia, infection, hypothyroidism, and drug side effects. In addition to low caloric intake, loss of muscle mass and changes in muscle enzymes may play an important role in fatigue during terminal illness. The importance of changes in the CNS, especially the reticular activating system, have been hypothesized based on reports of fatigue in patients receiving cranial radiation, experiencing depression, or having chronic pain in the absence of cachexia or other physiologic changes. Finally, depression and other causes of psychological distress can contribute to fatigue. ASSESSMENT Like pain and dyspnea, fatigue is subjective, as it represents a patient’s sense of tiredness and decreased capacity for physical work. Objective changes, even in body mass, may be absent. Consequently, assessment must rely on patient self-reporting. Scales used to measure fatigue, such as the Edmonton Functional Assessment Tool, the Fatigue Self-Report Scales, and the Rhoten Fatigue Scale, are usually appropriate for research but not clinical purposes. In clinical practice, a simple performance assessment such as the Karnofsky performance status or the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)’s question “How much of the day does the patient spend in bed?” may be the best measure. In the ECOG 0–4 performance status assessment, 0 = normal activity; 1 = symptomatic without being bedridden; 2 = requiring some, but \u003c50%, bed time; 3 = bedbound more than half the day; and 4 = bedbound all the time. Such a scale allows for assessment over time and correlates with overall disease severity and prognosis. A 2008 review by the European Association of Palliative Care also described several longer assessment tools that contained 9–20 items, including the Piper Fatigue Inventory, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). \n\n INTERVENTIONS Reversible causes of fatigue, such as anemia and infection, should be treated. However, at the end of life, it must be realistically acknowledged that fatigue will not be “cured.” The goal is to ameliorate fatigue and help patients and families adjust expectations. Behavioral interventions should be utilized to avoid blaming the patient for inactivity and to educate both the family and the patient that the underlying disease causes physiologic changes that produce low energy levels. Understanding that the problem is physiologic and not psychological can help alter expectations regarding the patient’s level of physical activity. Practically, this may mean reducing routine activities such as housework, cooking, and social events outside the house and making it acceptable to receive guests while lying on a couch. At the same time, the implementation of exercise regimens and physical therapy can raise endorphins, reduce muscle wasting, and decrease the risk of depression. In addition, ensuring good hydration without worsening edema may help reduce fatigue. Discontinuing medications that worsen fatigue may help, including cardiac medications, benzodiazepines, certain antidepressants, or opioids if the patient’s pain is well-controlled. As end-of-life care proceeds into its final stages, fatigue may protect patients from further suffering, and continued treatment could be detrimental. Only a few pharmacologic interventions target fatigue and weakness. Randomized controlled trials suggest glucocorticoids can increase energy and enhance mood. Dexamethasone (8 mg/d) is preferred for its once-a-day dosing and minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Benefit, if any, is usually seen within the first month. For fatigue related to anorexia, megestrol (480–800 mg) can be helpful. Psychostimulants such as dextroamphetamine (5–10 mg PO) and methylphenidate (2.5–5 mg PO) may enhance energy levels, although controlled trials have not shown these drugs to be effective for fatigue induced by mild \n\nand its intensity. Guidelines recommend visual analogue dyspnea scales to assess the severity of symptoms and the effects of treatment. Potentially reversible or treatable causes of dyspnea include infection, pleural effusions, pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, asthma, and tumor encroachment on the airway. However, the risk-versus-benefit ratio of the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for patients with little time left to live must be considered carefully before undertaking diagnostic steps. Frequently, the specific etiology cannot be identified, and dyspnea is the consequence of progression of the underlying disease that cannot be treated. The anxiety caused by dyspnea and the choking sensation can significantly exacerbate the underlying dyspnea in a negatively reinforcing cycle. \n\n**INTERVENTIONS** When reversible or treatable etiologies are diagnosed, they should be treated as long as the side effects of treatment, such as repeated drainage of effusions or anticoagulants, are less burdensome than the dyspnea itself. More aggressive treatments such as stenting a bronchial lesion may be warranted if it is clear that the dyspnea is due to tumor invasion at that site and if the patient and family understand the risks of such a procedure. Usually, treatment will be symptomatic **(Table 12-6)**. Supplemental oxygen does not appear to be effective. “A systematic review of the literature failed to demonstrate a consistent beneficial effect of oxygen inhalation over air inhalation for study participants with dyspnea due to end-stage cancer or cardiac failure.” Therefore, oxygen may be no more than an expensive placebo. Low-dose opioids reduce the sensitivity of the central respiratory center and relieve the sensation of dyspnea. If patients are not receiving opioids, weak opioids can be initiated; if patients are already receiving opioids, morphine or other stronger opioids should be used. Controlled trials do not support the use of nebulized opioids for dyspnea at the end of life. Phenothiazines and chlorpromazine may be helpful when combined with opioids. Benzodiazepines can be helpful in treating dyspnea, but only if anxiety is present. Benzodiazepines should not be used as first-line therapy or if there is no anxiety. If the patient has a history of COPD or asthma, inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids may be helpful. If the patient has pulmonary edema due to heart failure, diuresis with a medication such as furosemide is indicated. Excess secretions can be transdermally or intravenously dried with scopolamine. More general interventions that medical staff can perform include sitting the patient upright, removing smoke or other irritants like perfume, ensuring a supply of fresh air with sufficient humidity, and minimizing other factors that can increase anxiety. \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n to moderate cancer. Doses should be given in the morning and at noon to minimize the risk of counterproductive insomnia. Modafinil and armodafinil, developed for narcolepsy, have shown promise in the treatment of fatigue and have the advantage of once-daily dosing. Their precise role in fatigue at the end of life has not been documented but may be worth trying if other interventions are not beneficial. Anecdotal evidence suggests that L-carnitine may improve fatigue, depression, and sleep disruption. \n\n#### ■ PALLIATIVE SEDATION \n\n Palliative sedation is used in distressing situations that cannot be addressed in other ways. When patients experience severe symptoms, such as pain or dyspnea, that cannot be relieved by conventional interventions or experience acute catastrophic symptoms, such as uncontrolled seizures, then palliative sedation should be considered as an intervention of last resort. It can be abused if done to hasten death (which it usually does not), when done at the request of the family rather than according to the patient’s wishes, or when there are other interventions that could still be tried. The use of palliative sedation in cases of extreme existential or spiritual distress remains controversial. Typically, palliative sedation should be introduced only after the patient and family have been assured that all other interventions have been tried and after the patient and their loved ones have been able to “say goodbye.” Palliative sedation can be achieved by significantly increasing opioid doses until patients become unconscious and then putting them on a continuous infusion. Another commonly used medication for palliative sedation is midazolam at 1–5 mg IV every 5–15 min to calm the patient, followed by a continuous IV or subcutaneous infusion of 1 mg/h. In hospital settings, a continuous propofol infusion of 5 μg/kg per min can be used. There are also other, less commonly used medications for palliative sedation that include levomepromazine, chlorpromazine, and phenobarbital. \n\n## PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND THEIR \n\n## MANAGEMENT \n\n#### Depression * FREQUENCY AND IMPACT Depression at the end of \n\n life presents an apparently paradoxical situation. Many people believe that depression is normal among seriously ill patients because they are dying. People frequently say, “Wouldn’t you be depressed?” Although sadness, anxiety, anger, and irritability are normal responses to a serious condition, they are typically of modest intensity and transient. Persistent sadness and anxiety and the physically disabling symptoms that they can lead to are abnormal and suggestive of major depression. The precise number of terminally ill patients who are depressed is uncertain, primarily due to a lack of consistent diagnostic criteria and screening. Careful follow-up of patients suggests that while as many as 75% of terminally ill patients experience depressive symptoms, ~25% of terminally ill patients have major depression. Depression at the end of life is concerning because it can decrease the quality of life, interfere with closure in relationships and other separation work, obstruct adherence to medical interventions, and amplify the suffering associated with pain and other symptoms. ETIOLOGY Previous history of depression, family history of depression or bipolar disorder, and prior suicide attempts are associated with increased risk for depression among terminally ill patients. Other symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, are associated with higher rates of depression; uncontrolled pain can exacerbate depression, and depression can cause patients to be more distressed by pain. Many medications used in the terminal stages, including glucocorticoids, and some anticancer agents, such as tamoxifen, interleukin 2, interferon α, and vincristine, also are associated with depression. Some terminal conditions, such as pancreatic cancer, certain strokes, and heart failure, have been reported to be associated with higher rates of depression, although this is controversial. Finally, depression may be attributable to grief over the loss of a role or function, social isolation, or loneliness. ASSESSMENT Unfortunately, many studies suggest that most depressed patients at the end of life are not diagnosed, or if they are diagnosed, \n\n they are not properly treated. Diagnosing depression among seriously ill patients is complicated, as many of the vegetative symptoms in the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) criteria for clinical depression—insomnia, anorexia and weight loss, fatigue, decreased libido, and difficulty concentrating—are associated with the process of dying itself. The assessment of depression in seriously ill patients therefore should focus on the dysphoric mood, helplessness, hopelessness, and lack of interest, enjoyment, and concentration in normal activities. It is now recommended that patients near the end of life should be screened with either the PHQ-9 or the PHQ-2, which asks “Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems? (1) Little interest or pleasure in doing things and (2) feeling down, depressed or hopeless.” The answer categories are as follows: not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly every day. Other possible diagnostic tools include the short form of the Beck Depression Index or a visual analogue scale. Certain conditions may be confused with depression. Endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypercalcemia, and akathisia, especially from dopamine-blocking antiemetics such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, can mimic depression and should be excluded. \n\n INTERVENTIONS Undertreatment of depressed, terminally ill patients is common. Physicians must treat any physical symptom, such as pain, that may be causing or exacerbating depression. Fostering adaptation to the many losses that the patient is experiencing can also be helpful. Unfortunately, there are few randomized trials to guide such interventions. Thus, treatment typically follows the treatment used for non–terminally ill depressed patients. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, nonpharmacologic interventions, including group or individual psychological counseling, and behavioral therapies such as relaxation and imagery can be helpful, especially in combination with drug therapy. Pharmacologic interventions remain at the core of therapy. The same medications are used to treat depression in terminally ill as in non–terminally ill patients. Psychostimulants may be preferred for patients with a poor prognosis or for those with fatigue or opioidinduced somnolence. Psychostimulants are comparatively fast-acting, working within a few days instead of the weeks required for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate should be started at 2.5–5.0 mg in the morning and at noon, the same starting doses used for treating fatigue. The doses can eventually be escalated up to 15 mg bid. Modafinil is started at 100 mg qd and can be increased to 200 mg if there is no effect at the lower dose. Pemoline is a nonamphetamine psychostimulant with minimal abuse potential. It is also effective as an antidepressant beginning at 18.75 mg in the morning and at noon. Because it can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa, it is preferred for patients with intestinal obstruction or dysphagia. If it is used for prolonged periods, liver function must be monitored. The psychostimulants can also be combined with more traditional antidepressants while waiting for the antidepressants to become effective, then tapered down after a few weeks if necessary. Psychostimulants have side effects, particularly initial anxiety, insomnia, and very rarely paranoia, which may necessitate lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment. Mirtazapine, an antagonist at the postsynaptic serotonin receptors, is a promising psychostimulant. It should be started at 7.5 mg before bed and titrated up no more than once every 1–2 weeks to a maximal dose of 45 mg/d. It has sedating, antiemetic, and anxiolytic properties, with few drug interactions. Its side effect of weight gain may be beneficial for seriously ill patients; it is available in orally disintegrating tablets. For patients with a prognosis of several months or longer, SSRIs, including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, and citalopram, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine and duloxetine, are the preferred treatments, due to their efficacy and comparatively few side effects. Because low doses of these medications may be effective for seriously ill patients, one should use half the usual starting dose as for healthy adults. The starting dose for \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\nfluoxetine is 10 mg once a day. In most cases, once-a-day dosing is possible. The choice of which SSRI to use should be driven by (1) the patient’s past success or failure with the specific medication and (2) the most favorable side effect profile for that specific agent. For instance, for a patient in whom fatigue is a major symptom, a more activating SSRI (fluoxetine) would be appropriate. For a patient in whom anxiety and sleeplessness are major symptoms, a more sedating SSRI (paroxetine) would be appropriate. Importantly, it can take up to 4 weeks for these drugs to have an effect. Atypical antidepressants are recommended only in select circumstances, usually with the assistance of a specialty consultation. Trazodone can be an effective antidepressant but is sedating and can cause orthostatic hypotension and, occasionally, priapism. Therefore, it should be used before bed and only when a sedating effect is desired and is often used for patients with insomnia at a dose starting at 25 mg. Bupropion can also be used. In addition to its antidepressant effects, bupropion is energizing, making it useful for depressed patients who experience fatigue. However, it can cause seizures, preventing its use for patients with a risk of CNS neoplasms or terminal delirium. Finally, alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, starting at 0.25–1.0 mg tid, can be effective in seriously ill patients who have a combination of anxiety and depression. Although it is potent and works quickly, it has many drug interactions and may cause delirium, especially among very ill patients, because of its strong binding to the benzodiazepine–γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. Unless used as adjuvants for the treatment of pain, tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended. While they can be effective, their therapeutic window and serious side effects typically limit their utility. Similarly, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not recommended because of their side effects and dangerous drug interactions. \n\n#### Delirium (See Chap. 27) * FREQUENCY In the weeks or months \n\nbefore death, delirium is uncommon, although it may be significantly underdiagnosed. However, delirium becomes relatively common in the days and hours immediately before death. Up to 85% of patients dying from cancer may experience terminal delirium. \n\n**ETIOLOGY** Delirium is a global cerebral dysfunction characterized by alterations in cognition and consciousness. It is frequently preceded by anxiety, changes in sleep patterns (especially reversal of day and night), and decreased attention. In contrast to dementia, delirium has an acute onset, is characterized by fluctuating consciousness and inattention, and is reversible, although reversibility may be more theoretical than real for patients near death. Delirium may occur in a patient with dementia; indeed, patients with dementia are more vulnerable to delirium. Causes of delirium include metabolic encephalopathy arising from liver or renal failure, hypoxemia, or infection; electrolyte imbalances such as hypercalcemia; paraneoplastic syndromes; dehydration; and primary brain tumors, brain metastases, or leptomeningeal spread of tumor. Among dying patients, delirium is commonly caused by side effects of treatments, including radiation for brain metastases and medications, such as opioids, glucocorticoids, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, antiemetics, benzodiazepines, and chemotherapeutic agents. The etiology may be multifactorial; e.g., dehydration may exacerbate opioid-induced delirium. \n\n**ASSESSMENT** Delirium should be recognized in any terminally ill patient exhibiting new onset of disorientation, impaired cognition, somnolence, fluctuating levels of consciousness, or delusions with or without agitation. Delirium must be distinguished from acute anxiety, depression, and dementia. The central distinguishing feature is altered consciousness, which usually is not noted in anxiety, depression, or dementia. Although “hyperactive” delirium, characterized by overt confusion and agitation, is probably more common, patients should also be assessed for “hypoactive” delirium, which is characterized by sleep-wake reversal and decreased alertness. In some cases, use of formal assessment tools such as the MiniMental Status Examination (which does not distinguish delirium from dementia) and the Delirium Rating Scale (which does distinguish \n\n delirium from dementia) may be helpful in distinguishing delirium from other processes. The patient’s list of medications must be evaluated carefully. Nonetheless, a reversible etiologic factor for delirium is found in fewer than half of all terminally ill patients. Given that most terminally ill patients experiencing delirium are very close to death and often at home, extensive diagnostic evaluations such as lumbar punctures and neuroradiologic examinations are inappropriate. \n\n INTERVENTIONS One of the most important objectives of terminal care is to provide terminally ill patients the lucidity to say goodbye to the people they love. Delirium, especially when in combination with agitation during the final days, is distressing to family and caregivers. A strong determinant of bereavement difficulties is witnessing a difficult death. Thus, terminal delirium should be treated aggressively. At the first sign of delirium, such as day-night reversal with slight changes in mentation, the physician should let the family members know that it is time to be sure that everything they want to say has been said. The family should be informed that delirium is common just before death. If medications are suspected of being a cause of the delirium, unnecessary agents should be discontinued. Other potentially reversible causes, such as constipation, urinary retention, and metabolic abnormalities, should be treated. Supportive measures aimed at providing a familiar environment should be instituted, including restricting visits only to individuals with whom the patient is familiar and eliminating new experiences; orienting the patient, if possible, by providing a clock and calendar; and gently correcting the patient’s hallucinations or cognitive mistakes. Pharmacologic management focuses on the use of neuroleptics and, in extreme cases, anesthetics (Table 12-7). Haloperidol remains the first-line therapy. Usually, patients can be controlled with a low dose (1–3 mg/d), given every 6 h, although some may require as much as 20 mg/d. Haloperidol can be administered PO, SC, or IV. IM injections should not be used, except when this is the only way to address a patient’s delirium. Olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic, has shown significant effectiveness in completely resolving delirium in cancer patients. It also has other beneficial effects for terminally ill patients, including antinausea, antianxiety, and weight gain. Olanzapine is useful for patients with longer anticipated life expectancies because it is less likely to cause dysphoria and has a lower risk of dystonic reactions. Additionally, because olanzapine is metabolized through multiple pathways, it can be used in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction. Olanzapine has the disadvantage that it is only available orally and takes a week to reach steady state. The usual dose is 2.5–5 mg PO bid. Chlorpromazine (10–25 mg every 4–6 h) can be useful if sedation is desired and can be administered IV or PR in addition to PO. Dystonic reactions resulting from dopamine blockade are a side effect of neuroleptics, although they are reported to be rare when these drugs are used to treat terminal delirium. If patients develop dystonic reactions, benztropine should be administered. Neuroleptics may be \n\n TABLE 12-7 Medications for the Management of Delirium INTERVENTIONS DOSE Neuroleptics Haloperidol 0.5–5 mg q2–12h, PO/IV/SC/IM Thioridazine 10–75 mg q4–8h, PO Chlorpromazine 12.5–50 mg q4–12h, PO/IV/IM Atypical neuroleptics Olanzapine 2.5–5 mg qd or bid, PO Risperidone 1–3 mg q12h, PO Anxiolytics Lorazepam 0.5–2 mg q1–4h, PO/IV/IM Midazolam 1–5 mg/h continuous infusion, IV/SC Anesthetics Propofol 0.3–2.0 mg/h continuous infusion, IV \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n combined with lorazepam to reduce agitation when the delirium is the result of alcohol or sedative withdrawal. If no response to first-line therapy is observed, a specialty consultation should be obtained with a goal to change to a different medication. If the patient fails to improve after a second neuroleptic, sedation with either an anesthetic such as propofol or continuous-infusion midazolam may be necessary. By some estimates, as many as 25% of patients at the very end of life who experience delirium, especially restless delirium with myoclonus or convulsions, may require sedation. Physical restraints should be used with great reluctance and only when patients’ violence is threatening to themselves or others. If restraints are used, their appropriateness should be frequently reevaluated. \n\n#### Insomnia * FREQUENCY Sleep disorders, defined as difficulty \n\n initiating sleep or maintaining sleep, sleep difficulty at least 3 nights a week, or sleep difficulty that causes impairment of daytime functioning, occurs in 19–63% of patients with advanced cancer. Some 30–74% of patients with other end-stage conditions, including AIDS, heart disease, COPD, and renal disease, experience insomnia. ETIOLOGY Patients with cancer may experience changes in sleep efficiency, such as an increase in stage I sleep. Insomnia may also coexist with both physical illnesses, like thyroid disease, and psychological illnesses, like depression and anxiety. Medications, including antidepressants, psychostimulants, glucocorticoids, and β agonists, are significant contributors to sleep disorders, as are caffeine and alcohol. Multiple over-the-counter medications contain caffeine and antihistamines, which can contribute to sleep disorders. ASSESSMENT Assessments should include specific questions concerning sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early-morning wakening, as these will provide clues to both the causative agents and management of insomnia. Patients should be asked about previous sleep problems, screened for depression and anxiety, and asked about symptoms of thyroid disease. Caffeine and alcohol are prominent causes of sleep problems, and a careful history of the use of these substances should be obtained. Both excessive use and withdrawal from alcohol can be causes of sleep problems. INTERVENTIONS The mainstays of any intervention include improvement of sleep hygiene (encouragement of regular time for sleep, decreased nighttime distractions, elimination of caffeine and other stimulants and alcohol), interventions to treat anxiety and depression, and treatment for the insomnia itself. For patients with depression who have insomnia and anxiety, a sedating antidepressant such as mirtazapine can be helpful. In the elderly, trazodone, beginning at 25 mg at nighttime, is an effective sleep aid at doses lower than those that cause its antidepressant effect. Zolpidem may have a decreased incidence of delirium in patients compared with traditional benzodiazepines, but this has not been clearly established. When benzodiazepines are prescribed, short-acting ones (such as lorazepam) are favored over longeracting ones (such as diazepam). Patients who receive these medications should be observed for signs of increased confusion and delirium. \n\n#### ■ SOCIAL NEEDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT \n\n#### Financial Burdens * FREQUENCY Dying can impose substantial \n\n economic strains on patients and families, potentially causing distress. This is known as financial toxicity. In the United States, which has the least comprehensive health insurance systems among wealthy countries, a quarter of families coping with end-stage cancer report that care was a major financial burden and a third used up most of their savings. Among Medicare beneficiaries, average out-of-pocket costs were \u003e$8000. Between 10% and 30% of families are forced to sell assets, use savings, or take out a mortgage to pay for the patient’s health care costs. The patient is likely to reduce hours worked and eventually stop working altogether. In 20% of cases, a family member of the terminally ill patient also must stop working to provide care. The major underlying causes of economic burden are related to poor physical functioning and care needs, such as the need for housekeeping, nursing, and personal care. More debilitated patients and poor patients experience greater economic burdens. \n\n INTERVENTION The economic burden of end-of-life care should not be ignored as a private matter. It has been associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including preferring comfort care over life-prolonging care, as well as consideration of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Economic burdens increase the psychological distress of the families and caregivers of terminally ill patients, and poverty is associated with many adverse health outcomes. Importantly, studies have found that “patients with advanced cancer who reported having end-of-life conversations with physicians had significantly lower health care costs in their final week of life. Higher costs were associated with worse quality of death.” Assistance from a social worker, early on if possible, to ensure access to all available benefits may be helpful. Many patients, families, and health care providers are unaware of options for long-term care insurance, respite care, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), and other sources of assistance. Some of these options (such as respite care) may be part of a formal hospice program, but others (such as the FMLA) do not require enrollment in a hospice program. \n\n#### Relationships * FREQUENCY Settling personal issues and closing \n\n the narrative of lived relationships are universal needs. When asked if sudden death or death after an illness is preferable, respondents often initially select the former, but soon change to the latter as they reflect on the importance of saying goodbye. Bereaved family members who have not had the chance to say goodbye often have a more difficult grief process. INTERVENTIONS Care of seriously ill patients requires efforts to facilitate the types of encounters and time spent with family and friends that are necessary to meet those needs. Family and close friends may need to be accommodated in hospitals and other facilities with unrestricted visiting hours, which may include sleeping near the patient, even in otherwise regimented institutional settings. Physicians and other health care providers may be able to facilitate and resolve strained interactions between the patient and other family members. Assistance for patients and family members who are unsure about how to create or help preserve memories, whether by providing materials such as a scrapbook or memory box or by offering them suggestions and informational resources, can be deeply appreciated. Taking photographs and creating videos can be especially helpful to terminally ill patients who have younger children or grandchildren. \n\n#### Family Caregivers * FREQUENCY Caring for seriously ill patients \n\n places a heavy burden on families. Families are frequently required to provide transportation and homemaking, as well as other services. Typically, paid professionals, such as home health nurses and hospice workers, supplement family care; only about a quarter of all caregiving consists of exclusively paid professional assistance. Over the past 40 years, there has been a significant decline in the United States of deaths occurring in hospitals, with a simultaneous increase in deaths in other facilities and at home. Over a third of deaths occur in patients’ homes. This increase in out-of-hospital deaths increases reliance on families for end-of-life care. Increasingly, family members are being called upon to provide physical care (such as moving and bathing patients) and medical care (such as assessing symptoms and giving medications) in addition to emotional care and support. Three-quarters of family caregivers of terminally ill patients are women—wives, daughters, sisters, and even daughters-in-law. Since many are widowed, women tend to be able to rely less on family for caregiving assistance and may need more paid assistance. About 20% of terminally ill patients report substantial unmet needs for nursing and personal care. The impact of caregiving on family caregivers is substantial: both bereaved and current caregivers have a higher mortality rate than that of non-caregiving controls. INTERVENTIONS It is imperative to inquire about unmet needs and to try to ensure that those needs are met either through the family or by paid professional services when possible. Community assistance through houses of worship or other community groups often can be mobilized by telephone calls from the medical team to someone the patient or family identifies. Sources of support specifically for family \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\ncaregivers should be identified through local sources or nationally through groups such as the National Family Caregivers Association (www.nfcacares.org), the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org), and the Alzheimer’s Association (www.alz.org). \n\n#### ■ EXISTENTIAL NEEDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT \n\n#### Frequency Religion and spirituality are often important to dying \n\npatients. Nearly 70% of patients report becoming more religious or spiritual when they became terminally ill, and many find comfort in religious or spiritual practices such as prayer. However, ~20% of terminally ill patients become less religious, frequently feeling cheated or betrayed by becoming terminally ill. For other patients, the need is for existential meaning and purpose that is distinct from, and may even be antithetical to, religion or spirituality. When asked, patients and family caregivers frequently report wanting their professional caregivers to be more attentive to religion and spirituality. \n\n#### Assessment Health care providers are often hesitant about involv\n\ning themselves in the religious, spiritual, and existential experiences of their patients because it may seem private or not relevant to the current illness. But physicians and other members of the care team should be able at least to detect spiritual and existential needs. Screening questions have been developed for a physician’s spiritual history taking. Spiritual distress can amplify other types of suffering and even masquerade as intractable physical pain, anxiety, or depression. The screening questions in the comprehensive assessment are usually sufficient. Deeper evaluation and intervention are rarely appropriate for the physician unless no other member of a care team is available or suitable. Pastoral care providers may be helpful, whether from the medical institution or from the patient’s own community. \n\n#### Interventions Precisely how religious practices, spirituality, and \n\nexistential explorations can be facilitated and improve end-of-life care is not well established. What is clear is that for physicians, one main intervention is to inquire about the role and importance of spirituality and religion in a patient’s life. This will help a patient feel heard and help physicians identify specific needs. In one study, only 36% of respondents indicated that a clergy member would be comforting. Nevertheless, the increase in religious and spiritual interest among a substantial fraction of dying patients suggests inquiring of individual patients how this need can be addressed. Some evidence supports specific methods of addressing existential needs in patients, ranging from establishing a supportive group environment for terminal patients to individual treatments emphasizing a patient’s dignity and sources of meaning. \n\n## MANAGING THE LAST STAGES \n\n#### ■ PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES: HOW AND WHERE \n\nDetermining the best approach to providing palliative care to patients will depend on patient preferences, the availability of caregivers and specialized services in close proximity, institutional resources, and reimbursement. Hospice is a leading, but not the only, model of palliative care services. In the United States, slightly more than a third— 35.7%—of hospice care is provided in private residential homes with 14.5% of hospice care in nursing homes. In the United States, Medicare pays for hospice services under Part A, the hospital insurance part of reimbursement. Two physicians must certify that the patient has a prognosis of ≤6 months if the disease runs its usual course. Prognoses are probabilistic by their nature; patients are not required to die within 6 months but rather to have a condition from which half the individuals with it would not be alive within 6 months. Patients sign a hospice enrollment form that states their intent to forgo curative services related to their terminal illness but can still receive medical services for other comorbid conditions. Patients also can withdraw enrollment and reenroll later; the hospice Medicare benefit can be revoked later to secure traditional Medicare benefits. Payments to the hospice are per diem (or capitated), not fee-for-service. Payments are intended to cover physician services for the medical direction of the care team; \n\n regular home care visits by registered nurses and licensed practical nurses; home health aide and homemaker services; chaplain services; social work services; bereavement counseling; and medical equipment, supplies, and medications. No specific therapy is excluded, and the goal is for each therapy to be considered for its symptomatic (as opposed to disease-modifying) effect. Additional clinical care, including services of the primary physician, is covered by Medicare Part B even while the hospice Medicare benefit is in place. The Affordable Care Act directs the secretary of Health and Human Services to gather data on Medicare hospice reimbursement with the goal of reforming payment rates to account for resource use over an entire episode of care. The legislation also requires additional evaluations and reviews of eligibility for hospice care by hospice physicians or nurses. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) sponsors and carries out demonstration projects to test models and evaluate the potential of new methods. In 2016, CMMI started a 5-year test of concurrent hospice and palliative care services with curative treatment for terminally ill patients who have a life expectancy of ≤6 months. A 4-year test initiated in 2021 will examine the inclusion of hospice in Medicare Advantage covering 8% of the market and include important health plans. By 2018, the average length of enrollment in a hospice for Medicare beneficiaries was 90 days. However, the median length of stay was just 18 days, suggesting most patients are in hospice for a short time. Such short stays create barriers to establishing high-quality palliative services in patients’ homes and also place financial strains on hospice providers since the initial assessments are resource intensive. Physicians should initiate early referrals to the hospice to allow more time for patients to receive palliative care. In the United States, hospice care has been the main method for securing palliative services for terminally ill patients. However, leading physicians have increasingly emphasized the need to introduce palliative care much earlier in patients’ illness, and efforts are being made to develop palliative care services that can be provided before the last 6 months of life and across a variety of settings. Studies of terminally ill patients indicate that those who received in-home palliative care delivered by an interdisciplinary team compared to usual care were more satisfied, more likely to die at home, and had fewer visits to the emergency room and lower per-day costs. More companies and home health agencies are now offering nonhospice palliative care services in patients’ homes in an effort to increase quality of life and forestall emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Similarly, palliative care services are increasingly available via consultation, rather than being available only in hospital, day care, outpatient, and nursing home settings. Palliative care consultations for nonhospice patients can be billed as for other consultations under Medicare Part B. It is argued that using palliative care earlier in patients’ illness allows patients and family members to become more acculturated to avoiding life-sustaining treatments, facilitating a smoother transition to hospice care closer to death. \n\n#### ■ WITHDRAWING AND WITHHOLDING \n\n#### LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT \n\n#### Legal Aspects For centuries, it has been deemed ethical to with\n\n hold or withdraw life-sustaining interventions. The current legal consensus in the United States and most wealthy countries is that patients have a moral as well as legal right to refuse medical interventions. American courts also have held that incompetent patients have a right to refuse medical interventions. For patients who are incompetent and terminally ill and who have not completed an advance care directive, next of kin can exercise that right, although this may be restricted in some states, depending on how clear and convincing the evidence is of the patient’s preferences. Courts have limited families’ ability to terminate life-sustaining treatments in patients who are conscious and incompetent but not terminally ill. In theory, patients’ right to refuse medical therapy can be limited by four countervailing interests: (1) preservation of life, (2) prevention of suicide, (3) protection of third parties such as children, and (4) preservation of the integrity of the \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n medical profession. In practice, these interests almost never override the right of competent patients and incompetent patients who have left explicit wishes or advance care directives. For incompetent patients who either appointed a proxy without specific indications of their wishes or never completed an advance care directive, three criteria have been suggested to guide the decision to terminate medical interventions. First, some commentators suggest that ordinary care should be administered but extraordinary care could be terminated. Because the ordinary/extraordinary distinction is too vague, courts and commentators widely agree that it should not be used to justify decisions about stopping treatment. Second, many courts have advocated the use of the substituted-judgment criterion, which holds that the proxy decision-makers should try to imagine what the incompetent patient would do if he or she were competent. However, multiple studies indicate that many proxies, even close family members, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have wanted. Therefore, substituted judgment becomes more of a guessing game than a way of fulfilling the patient’s wishes. Finally, the best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate treatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those treatments where the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of treatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully and dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of specific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as possible, different individuals can have very different views of what is in the patient’s best interests, and families may have disagreements or even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because there is no single way to determine the balance between benefits and burdens; it depends on a patient’s personal values. For instance, for some people, being alive even if mentally incapacitated is a benefit, whereas for others, it may be the worst possible existence. As a matter of practice, physicians rely on family members to make decisions that they feel are best and object only if those decisions seem to demand treatments that the physicians consider not beneficial. \n\n#### Practices Withholding and withdrawing acutely life-sustaining \n\n medical interventions from terminally ill patients are now standard practice. More than 90% of American patients die without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other potentially life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in ICUs in the period of 1987–1988, CPR was performed 49% of the time, but it was performed only 10% of the time in 1992–1993 and on just 1.8% of admissions from 2001 to 2008. On average, 3.8 interventions, such as vasopressors and transfusions, were stopped for each dying ICU patient. However, up to 19% of decedents in hospitals received interventions such as extubation, ventilation, and surgery in the 48 h preceding death. There is wide variation in practices among hospitals and ICUs, suggesting an important element of physician preferences rather than consistent adherence to professional society recommendations. Mechanical ventilation may be the most challenging intervention to withdraw. The two approaches are terminal extubation, which is the removal of the endotracheal tube, and terminal weaning, which is the gradual reduction of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) or ventilator rate. One-third of ICU physicians prefer to use the terminal weaning technique, and 13% extubate; the majority of physicians utilize both techniques. The American Thoracic Society’s 2008 clinical policy guidelines note that there is no single correct process of ventilator withdrawal and that physicians use and should be proficient in both methods but that the chosen approach should carefully balance benefits and burdens as well as patient and caregiver preferences. Some recommend terminal weaning because patients do not develop upper airway obstruction and the distress caused by secretions or stridor; however, terminal weaning can prolong the dying process and not allow a patient’s family to be with the patient unencumbered by an endotracheal tube. To ensure comfort for conscious or semiconscious patients before withdrawal of the ventilator, neuromuscular blocking agents should be terminated and sedatives and analgesics administered. Removing the neuromuscular blocking agents permits patients to show discomfort, facilitating the titration of sedatives and analgesics; it also permits interactions between patients and their families. A common \n\n practice is to inject a bolus of midazolam (2–4 mg) or lorazepam (2–4 mg) before withdrawal, followed by a bolus of 5–10 mg of morphine and continuous infusion of morphine (50% of the bolus dose per hour) during weaning. In patients who have significant upper airway secretions, IV scopolamine at a rate of 100 μg/h can be administered. Additional boluses of morphine or increases in the infusion rate should be administered for respiratory distress or signs of pain. Higher doses will be needed for patients already receiving sedatives and opioids. The median time to death after stopping of the ventilator is 1 h. However, up to 10% of patients unexpectedly survive for 1 day or more after mechanical ventilation is stopped. Women and older patients tend to survive longer after extubation. Families need to be reassured about both the continuations of treatments for common symptoms, such as dyspnea and agitation, after withdrawal of ventilatory support and the uncertainty of length of survival after withdrawal of ventilatory support. \n\n#### ■ FUTILE CARE \n\n Beginning in the late 1980s, some commentators argued that physicians could terminate futile treatments demanded by the families of terminally ill patients. Although no objective definition or standard of futility exists, several categories have been proposed. Physiologic futility means that an intervention will have no physiologic effect. Some have defined qualitative futility as applying to procedures that “fail to end a patient’s total dependence on intensive medical care.” Quantitative futility occurs “when physicians conclude (through personal experience, experiences shared with colleagues, or consideration of reported empiric data) that in the last 100 cases, a medical treatment has been useless.” The term conceals subjective value judgments about when a treatment is “not beneficial.” Deciding whether a treatment that obtains an additional 6 weeks of life or a 1% survival advantage confers benefit depends on patients’ preferences and goals. Furthermore, physicians’ predictions of when treatments are futile deviate markedly from the quantitative definition. When residents thought CPR was quantitatively futile, more than one in five patients had a \u003e10% chance of survival to hospital discharge. Most studies that purport to guide determinations of futility are based on insufficient data and therefore cannot provide statistical confidence for clinical decision-making. Quantitative futility rarely applies in ICU settings. Many commentators reject using futility as a criterion for withdrawing care, preferring instead to consider futility situations as ones that represent conflict that calls for careful negotiation between families and health care providers. The American Medical Association and other professional societies have developed process-based approaches to resolving cases clinicians feel are futile. These process-based measures mainly suggest involving consultants and/or ethics committees when there are seemingly irresolvable differences. Some hospitals have enacted “unilateral do-not-resuscitate” policies to allow clinicians to provide a do-not-resuscitate order in cases in which consensus cannot be reached with families and medical opinion is that resuscitation would be futile if attempted. This type of a policy is not a replacement for careful and patient communication and negotiation but recognizes that agreement cannot always be reached. In 1999, Texas enacted the so-called Futile Care Act. Other states, such as Virginia, Maryland, and California, have also enacted such laws that provide physicians a “safe harbor” from liability if they refuse a patient’s or family’s request for life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in Texas, when a disagreement about terminating interventions between the medical team and the family has not been resolved by an ethics consultation, the physician is tasked with trying to facilitate transfer of the patient to an institution willing to provide treatment. If this fails after 10 days, the hospital and physician may unilaterally withdraw treatments determined to be futile. The family may appeal to a state court. Early data suggest that the law increases futility consultations for the ethics committee and that, although most families concur with withdrawal, ~10–15% of families refuse to withdraw treatment. As of 2007, there had been 974 ethics committee consultations on medical futility cases and 65 in which committees ruled against families and gave notice that treatment would be terminated. In 2007, \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\na survey of Texas hospitals showed that 30% of hospitals had used the futility law in 213 adult cases and 42 pediatric cases. Treatment was withdrawn for 27 of those patients, and the remainder were transferred to other facilities or died while awaiting transfer. \n\n#### ■ EUTHANASIA AND PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE \n\nEuthanasia and PAS are defined in **Table 12-8**. Terminating lifesustaining care and providing opioid medications to manage symptoms such as pain or dyspnea have long been considered ethical by the medical profession and legal by courts and should not be conflated with euthanasia or PAS. \n\n#### Legal Aspects Euthanasia and PAS are legal in the Netherlands, \n\nBelgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, Canada, Spain, Western Australia, and New Zealand. Euthanasia was legalized in the Northern Territory of Australia in 1996, but that legislation was repealed 9 months later in 1997. Under certain conditions, a layperson in Switzerland or Germany can legally elect assisted suicide. In the United States, PAS is legal in Washington, D.C., and 10 states: Oregon, Washington State, Montana, Vermont, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, and New Mexico. No state in the United States has legalized euthanasia. In the United States, multiple criteria must be met for PAS: the patient must have a terminal condition of \u003c6 months and must be determined eligible through a process that includes a 15-day waiting period. In 2009, the state supreme court of Montana ruled that state law permits PAS for terminally ill patients. Many other countries, such as Portugal, are actively debating the legalization of euthanasia and/or PAS. \n\n#### Practices Fewer than 10–20% of terminally ill patients actually \n\nconsider euthanasia and/or PAS for themselves. Use of euthanasia and PAS is increasing but remains relatively rare. In all countries, even the Netherlands and Belgium where these practices have been tolerated and legal for many years, \u003c5% of death occur by euthanasia or PAS. As of the most recent data, 4.7% of all deaths were by euthanasia or PAS in the Netherlands (2015) and 4.6% in Belgium (2013). Just 0.50% of all deaths in Oregon in 2019 (188 of 37,397 deaths) and 0.36% of all deaths in Washington State in 2018 (203 of 56,913 deaths) were reported to be by PAS, although these may be underestimates since the cause of some deaths of patients who received medications could not be verified. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Oregon, and Washington, \u003e70% of patients utilizing these interventions are dying of cancer; \u003c10% of deaths by euthanasia or PAS involve patients with AIDS or amyotrophic \n\n TABLE 12-8 Definitions of Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia TERM DEFINITION LEGAL STATUS Voluntary active euthanasia \n\n Intentionally administering medications or other interventions to cause the patient’s death with the patient’s informed consent \n\n Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Colombia, Spain, Western Australia, New Zealand Involuntary active euthanasia \n\n Intentionally administering medications or other interventions to cause the patient’s death when the patient was competent to consent but did not—e.g., the patient may not have been asked \n\n Nowhere \n\n Passive euthanasia \n\n Withholding or withdrawing lifesustaining medical treatments from a patient to let him or her die (terminating life-sustaining treatments) \n\n Everywhere \n\n Physicianassisted suicide \n\n A physician provides medications or other interventions to a patient with the understanding that the patient can use them to commit suicide \n\n Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Switzerland, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico \n\n lateral sclerosis. While the numbers are small, in the Netherlands, the numbers of euthanasia or PAS cases in patients with psychiatric disorders, dementia, and the accumulation of health issues are increasing. Pain is not the primary motivator for patients’ requests for or interest in euthanasia and/or PAS. Among the first patients to receive PAS in Oregon, only 1 of the 15 patients had inadequate pain control, compared with 15 of the 43 patients in a control group who experienced inadequate pain relief. About 33% of patients in Oregon seeking PAS currently cite pain or fear of pain as their main reason for doing so. Conversely, depression and hopelessness are strongly associated with patient interest in euthanasia and PAS. Concerns about loss of dignity or autonomy or being a burden on family members appear to be more important factors motivating a desire for euthanasia or PAS. Losing autonomy (87% Oregon [OR], 85% Washington [WA]), not being able to enjoy activities (90% OR, 84% WA), and fear of losing dignity (72% OR, 69% WA) are the most-cited end-of-life concerns in both states. A high percentage of patients seeking PAS note being a burden on family (59% OR, 51% WA). A study from the Netherlands showed that depressed terminally ill cancer patients were four times more likely to request euthanasia and confirmed that uncontrolled pain was not associated with greater interest in euthanasia. Euthanasia and PAS are no guarantee of a painless, quick death. Data from the Netherlands indicate that in as many as 20% of euthanasia and PAS cases technical and other problems arose, including patients waking from coma, not becoming comatose, regurgitating medications, and experiencing a prolonged time to death. Data from Oregon between 1998 and 2017 and Washington between 2009 and 2017 indicate that of patients who received PAS prescriptions, 81% died at home and prescribers were present in 9.7% of cases. The time between drug intake and coma ranged from 1 min to 11 h, and the time from drug intake to death ranged from 1 min to 104 h. The median time from ingestion to coma was 5 min and from ingestion to death was 25 min. In Oregon between 1998 and 2015, 53% of patients had no complications, 44% of patients had no data on complications, and 2.4% of patients had regurgitation after taking the prescribed medicine as the only complication. In addition, six patients awakened. In Washington State between 2014 and 2015, 1.4% of patients had regurgitation, one patient had a seizure, and the reported range of time to death extended to 30 h. In the Netherlands, problems were significantly more common in PAS, sometimes requiring the physician to intervene and provide euthanasia. Regardless of whether they practice in a setting where euthanasia is legal or not, many physicians over the course of their careers will receive a patient request for euthanasia or PAS. In the United States, 18% of physicians have received a request for PAS and 11% have received a request for euthanasia. Three percent complied with a request for PAS, while 5% complied with a request for euthanasia. In the Netherlands, where the practices are legal, 77% of physicians have received a request for PAS or euthanasia and 60% have performed these interventions. Competency in dealing with such a request is crucial. Although challenging, the request can also provide a chance to address intense suffering. After receiving a request for euthanasia and/or PAS, health care providers should carefully clarify the request with empathic, openended questions to help elucidate the underlying cause for the request, such as, “What makes you want to consider this option?” Endorsing either moral opposition or moral support for the act tends to be counterproductive, giving an impression of being judgmental or of endorsing the idea that the patient’s life is worthless. Health care providers must reassure the patient of continued care and commitment. The patient should be educated about alternative, less laden options, such as symptom management and withdrawing any unwanted treatments, and the reality of euthanasia and/or PAS, since the patient may have misconceptions about their effectiveness as well as the legal implications of the choice. Depression, hopelessness, and other symptoms of psychological distress, as well as physical suffering and economic burdens, are likely factors motivating the request, and such factors should be assessed and treated aggressively. After these interventions and clarification of options, most patients proceed with another approach, \n\n---\n\n#### PA RT 1 \n\n#### The Profession of Medicine \n\n declining life-sustaining interventions, possibly including refusal of nutrition and hydration. \n\n#### ■ CARE DURING THE LAST HOURS \n\n Most laypersons have limited experiences with the actual dying process and death. They frequently do not know what to expect of the final hours and afterward. The family and other caregivers must be prepared, especially if the plan is for the patient to die at home. Patients in the last days of life typically experience extreme weakness and fatigue and become bedbound; this can lead to pressure sores. The issue of turning patients who are near the end of life, however, must be balanced against the potential discomfort that movement may cause. Patients stop eating and drinking with drying of mucosal membranes and dysphagia. Careful attention to oral swabbing, lubricants for lips, and use of artificial tears can provide a form of care to substitute for attempts at feeding the patient. With loss of the gag reflex and dysphagia, patients may also experience accumulation of oral secretions, producing noises during respiration sometimes called “the death rattle.” Scopolamine can reduce the secretions. Patients also experience changes in respiration with periods of apnea or Cheyne-Stokes \n\n breathing. Decreased intravascular volume and cardiac output cause tachycardia, hypotension, peripheral coolness, and livedo reticularis (skin mottling). Patients can have urinary and, less frequently, fecal incontinence. Changes in consciousness and neurologic function generally lead to two different paths to death. Each of these terminal changes can cause patients and families distress, requiring reassurance and targeted interventions (Table 12-9). Informing families that these changes might occur and providing them with an information sheet can help preempt problems and minimize distress. Understanding that patients stop eating because they are dying, not dying because they have stopped eating, can reduce family and caregiver anxiety. Similarly, informing the family and caregivers that the “death rattle” may occur and that it is not indicative of suffocation, choking, or pain can reduce their worry from the breathing sounds. Families and caregivers may also feel guilty about stopping treatments, fearing that they are “killing” the patient. This may lead to demands for interventions, such as feeding tubes, that may be ineffective. In such cases, the physician should remind the family and caregivers about the inevitability of events and the palliative goals. \n\n TABLE 12-9 Managing Changes in the Patient’s Condition during the Final Days and Hours CHANGES IN THE PATIENT’S CONDITION \n\n POTENTIAL COMPLICATION \n\n FAMILY’S POSSIBLE REACTION AND CONCERN ADVICE AND INTERVENTION Profound fatigue \n\n Bedbound with development of pressure ulcers that are prone to infection, malodor, and pain, and joint pain \n\n Patient is lazy and giving up. \n\n Reassure family and caregivers that terminal fatigue will not respond to interventions and should not be resisted. Use an air mattress if necessary. \n\n Anorexia None Patient is giving up; patient will suffer from hunger and will starve to death. \n\n Reassure family and caregivers that the patient is not eating because he or she is dying; not eating at the end of life does not cause suffering or death. Forced feeding, whether oral, parenteral, or enteral, does not reduce symptoms or prolong life. \n\n Dehydration Dry mucosal membranes (see below) \n\n Patient will suffer from thirst and die of dehydration. \n\n Reassure family and caregivers that dehydration at the end of life does not cause suffering because patients lose consciousness before any symptom distress. Intravenous hydration can worsen symptoms of dyspnea by pulmonary edema and peripheral edema as well as prolong the dying process. Dysphagia Inability to swallow oral medications needed for palliative care \n\n Do not force oral intake. Discontinue unnecessary medications that may have been continued, including antibiotics, diuretics, antidepressants, and laxatives. If swallowing pills is difficult, convert essential medications (analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics, and psychotropics) to oral solutions, buccal, sublingual, or rectal administration. “Death rattle”—noisy breathing \n\n Patient is choking and suffocating. \n\n Reassure the family and caregivers that this is caused by secretions in the oropharynx and the patient is not choking. Reduce secretions with scopolamine (0.2–0.4 mg SC q4h or 1–3 patches q3d). Reposition patient to permit drainage of secretions. Do not suction. Suction can cause patient and family discomfort and is usually ineffective. Apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, dyspnea \n\n Patient is suffocating. \n\n Reassure family and caregivers that unconscious patients do not experience suffocation or air hunger. Apneic episodes are frequently a premorbid change. Opioids or anxiolytics may be used for dyspnea. Oxygen is unlikely to relieve dyspneic symptoms and may prolong the dying process. Urinary or fecal incontinence \n\n Skin breakdown if days until death Potential transmission of infectious agents to caregivers \n\n Patient is dirty, malodorous, and physically repellent. \n\n Remind family and caregivers to use universal precautions. Frequent changes of bedclothes and bedding. Use diapers, urinary catheter, or rectal tube if diarrhea or high urine output. \n\n Agitation or delirium \n\n Day/night reversal Hurt self or caregivers \n\n Patient is in horrible pain and going to have a horrible death. \n\n Reassure family and caregivers that agitation and delirium do not necessarily connote physical pain. Depending on the prognosis and goals of treatment, consider evaluating for causes of delirium and modifying medications. Manage symptoms with haloperidol, chlorpromazine, diazepam, or midazolam. Dry mucosal membranes \n\n Cracked lips, mouth sores, and candidiasis can also cause pain. Odor \n\n Patient may be malodorous, physically repellent. \n\n Use baking soda mouthwash or saliva preparation q15–30 min. Use topical nystatin for candidiasis. Coat lips and nasal mucosa with petroleum jelly q60–90 min. Use ophthalmic lubricants q4h or artificial tears q30 min. \n\n---\n\n#### Palliative and End-of-Life Care \n\n#### CHAPTER 12 \n\nInterventions may prolong the dying process and cause discomfort. Physicians also should emphasize that withholding treatments is both legal and ethical and that the family members are not the cause of the patient’s death. This reassurance may have to be provided multiple times. Hearing and touch are said to be the last senses to stop functioning. Whether this is the case or not, families and caregivers can be encouraged to communicate with the dying patient. Encouraging them to talk directly to the patient, even if he or she is unconscious, and hold the patient’s hand or demonstrate affection in other ways can be an effective way to channel their urge “to do something” for the patient. When the plan is for the patient to die at home, the physician must inform the family and caregivers how to determine that the patient has died. The cardinal signs are cessation of cardiac function and respiration; the pupils become fixed; the body becomes cool; muscles relax; and incontinence may occur. Remind the family and caregivers that the eyes may remain open even after the patient has died. The physician should establish a plan for who the family or caregivers will contact when the patient is dying or has died. Without a plan, family members may panic and call 911, unleashing a cascade of unwanted events, from arrival of emergency personnel and resuscitation to hospital admission. The family and caregivers should be instructed to contact the hospice (if one is involved), the covering physician, or the on-call member of the palliative care team. They should also be told that the medical examiner need not be called unless the state requires it for all deaths. Unless foul play is suspected, the health care team need not contact the medical examiner either. Just after the patient dies, even the best-prepared family may experience shock and loss and be emotionally distraught. They need time to assimilate the event and be comforted. Health care providers are likely to find it meaningful to write a bereavement card or letter to the family. The purpose is to communicate about the patient, perhaps emphasizing the patient’s virtues and the honor it was to care for the patient, and to express concern for the family’s hardship. Some physicians attend the funerals of their patients. Although this is beyond any medical obligation, the presence of the physician can be a source of support to the grieving family and provides an opportunity for closure for the physician. Death of a spouse is a strong predictor of poor health, and even mortality, for the surviving spouse. It may be important to alert the spouse’s physician about the death so that he or she is aware of symptoms that might require professional attention. \n\n#### ■ FURTHER READING \n\nEmanuel E et al: Attitudes and practices of euthanasia and physicianassisted suicide in the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Postural dizziness (severe enough to stop the test) or an increase in heart rate of at least 30 beats/minute has sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 96% for blood loss \u003e630 mL. Unless associated with dizziness, postural hypotension of any degree has little value.\n2. Body fat “distributions” by waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) are much better markers for cardiovascular risk than the body mass index (BMI) alone. In fact, a WC \u003c100 cm practically excludes insulin resistance.\n3. An acute difference in systolic pressure \u003e20 mmHg between the two arms usually indicates aortic dissection (complicated by aortic regurgitation (AR) in cases of more proximal dissection). If chronic, it indicates instead a subclavian artery occlusion or a subclavian steal syndrome.\n4. An ankle-to-arm systolic pressure index (AAI) \u003c0.97 identifies patients with angiographically proven occlusions/stenoses of lower extremities arteries with 96% sensitivity and 94%–100% specificity. Most patients with claudication will have AAI values between 0.5 and 0.8, whereas those with pain at rest will have values \u003c0.5. Indexes \u003c0.2 are associated with ischemic or gangrenous extremities.\n5. Paired, transverse, white nail bands in the second, third, and fourth fingers (Muehrcke’s lines) suggest chronic hypoalbuminemia, occurring in more than three-quarters of patients with nephrotic syndrome (\u003c2.3 gm/100 mL) but also in liver disease and malnutrition.\n6. In a study of 118 subjects with acrochordons (skin tags), 41% had either impaired glucose tolerance or overt type 2 diabetes.\n7. Ten percent of patients with vitiligo have serologic or clinical evidence of autoimmune disorders; the most common are thyroid diseases, especially hypothyroidism of the Hashimoto variety. Diabetes, Addison’s disease, pernicious anemia, alopecia areata, and uveitis (Vogt-Koyanagi syndrome) also are frequent.\n8. Twenty percent of patients with acanthosis nigricans (AN) have an aggressive underlying neoplasm – a gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy in 90% of cases, of which 60% were gastric. Still, most patients with AN have just obesity and insulin resistance.\n9. To separate icterus from the brownish color normally present in the bulbar conjunctiva of dark-skinned individuals, ask the patient to look upward. Then inspect the inferior conjunctival recess. This should be entirely white in nonicteric subjects, since the brownish discoloration of these individuals is the result of sunlight exposure.\n10. Earliest signs of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy include microaneurysms and dot intraretinal hemorrhages, with progression of disease characterized by an increase in number and size of microaneurysms and intraretinal hemorrhages (both dot and blot). Soft exudates are not as predictive, and hard exudates even less.\n11. Diagonal earlobe creases in adults are an acquired phenomenon and a significant independent variable for coronary artery disease. Hair in the external ear canal also seems to be associated with coronary artery disease.\n12. Findings that can best separate patients with and without strep throat are: (1) pharyngeal or tonsillar exudates, (2) fever by history, (3) tonsillar enlargement, (4) tenderness or enlargement of the anterior cervical and jugulodigastric lymph nodes, and (5) absence of cough.\n13. Multiple white, warty, corrugated, painless plaques on the lateral margins of the tongue (hairy leukoplakia) represent an Epstein-Barr–induced lesion typical of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, even though this can also occur in severely immunocompromised organ transplant patients. If present, it carries a worse prognosis for HIV progression.\n14. Pemberton’s maneuver (reversible superior vena cava obstruction caused by a substernal goiter being ‘‘lifted’’ into the thoracic inlet as a result of arm raising) is a nonspecific finding that may be encountered in patients with substernal thyroid masses, lymphomas, or upper mediastinal tumors.\n15. The average size of a thyroid nodule detected on exam is 3 cm. In fact, the larger the nodule, the more likely it will be detected (with \u003c1 cm nodules being missed 90% of the time; \u003c2 cm nodules being missed 50% of the time).\n16. Findings most suggestive of hyperthyroidism include lid retraction (likelihood ratio [LR] +31.5), lid lag (LR +17.6), fine finger tremor (LR +11.4), moist and warm skin (LR +6.7), and tachycardia (LR +4.4). Findings more likely to rule out hyperthyroidism are normal thyroid size (LR −0.1), heart rate \u003c90/minute (LR −0.2), and no finger tremor (LR −0.3). Older hyperthyroid patients exhibit more anorexia and atrial fibrillation; more frequent lack of goiter; and overall fewer signs, with tachycardia, fatigue, and weight loss in more than 50% of patients (and all three in 32%).\n17. Findings more strongly suggestive of hypothyroidism are bradycardia (LR +3.88), abnormal ankle reflex (LR +3.41), and coarse skin (LR +2.3). No single finding, when absent, can effectively rule out hypothyroidism.\n18. In a patient presenting with an acute vestibular syndrome, the presence of any of the three following signs: a normal head impulse, meaning that when their head is rapidly moved by the examiner from side to side that their gaze remains forward and conjugate; if on lateral gaze the fast phase of nystagmus changes direction; or they have a skew deviation (vertical ocular misalignment noted on cover/uncover testing) was found to have a 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity for stroke, which was superior to MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).\n19. A brisk arterial upstroke with a widened pulse pressure indicates AR. A brisk arterial upstroke with a normal pulse pressure instead indicates either the simultaneous emptying of the left ventricle into a high-pressure bed (the aorta) and a lower-pressure bed (like the right ventricle in patients with ventricular septal defect, or the left atrium in patients with mitral regurgitation [MR]), or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n20. The alternation of strong and weak arterial pulses despite regular rate and rhythm (pulsus alternans) indicates severe left ventricular dysfunction, with worse ejection fraction and higher pulmonary capillary pressure. Hence, it is often associated with an S3 gallop.\n21. Visible neck veins in the upright position indicate a central venous pressure (CVP) \u003e7 cmH 2 O and thus are pathologic.\n22. In chronic heart failure, jugular venous distention represents an ominous prognostic variable, independently associated with adverse outcomes, including risk of death or hospitalization. The presence of S3 is similarly (and independently) associated with increased risk.\n23. Presence of either end-inspiratory crackles or distended neck veins has high specificity (90%–100%) but low sensitivity (10%–50%) for increased left-sided filling pressure due to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction.\n24. Positive abdominojugular reflux has equally high specificity (but better sensitivity, 55%–85%) for increased left-sided filling pressure. S3 gallop, downward and lateral displacement of the apical impulse, and peripheral edema also have high specificity (\u003e95%) but low sensitivity (10%–40%). Of these, only the S3 and the displaced apical impulse have a positive LR (5.7 and 5.8, respectively).\n25. In patients presenting with dyspnea, an abdominojugular reflux argues in favor of bi-ventricular failure and suggests a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure \u003e15 mmHg. Conversely, a negative abdominojugular reflux in a patient with dyspnea argues strongly against increased left atrial pressure.\n26. Posturally induced crackles (PICs) after myocardial infarction (MI) carry an ominous significance, reflecting higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, lower pulmonary venous compliance, and higher mortality. After the number of diseased coronary vessels and the patient’s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, PICs rank third as most important predictor of recovery after an acute MI.\n27. Ischemic heart disease patients with S3 have a 1-year mortality that is much higher than those without it (57% versus 14%). The same applies to a displaced apical impulse (39% versus 12%).\n28. Leg swelling without increased CVP suggests bilateral venous insufficiency or noncardiac edema (hepatic or renal).\n29. The Valsalva maneuver has excellent specificity and sensitivity (90%–99% and 70%–95%, respectively) for detecting left ventricular dysfunction, either systolic or diastolic.\n30. The proportional pulse pressure (PPP) – arterial pulse pressure divided by the systolic blood pressure has excellent sensitivity (91%) and specificity (83%) for identifying low cardiac index (CI). A PPP \u003c0.25 has a positive LR of 5.4 for CI of 2.2 L/min/m 2 .\n31. Patients with distended neck veins, dyspnea/tachypnea, tachycardia, and clear lungs should be thought of as having tamponade; thus their pulsus paradoxus must be measured.\n32. A pulsus paradoxus \u003e21 mmHg has good sensitivity and excellent specificity for tamponade. It also may be palpable.\n33. A paradoxical increase in venous distention during inspiration (Kussmaul’s sign) is not a feature of tamponade but does occur in 30%–50% of patients with “pure” constrictive pericarditis; 90% of patients with constrictive pericarditis also have a retracting apical impulse.\n34. A loud S1 should always alert the clinician to the possibility of mitral stenosis and should thus prompt a search for its associated diastolic rumble.\n35. An audible physiologic splitting of S2 is age dependent, present in 60% of subjects younger than 30 and 30% of those older than 60.\n36. Wide splitting of S2 usually reflects a delayed closure of the pulmonic valve because of either a right bundle branch block or pulmonary hypertension.\n37. S2 that remains audibly split throughout respiration, both in the supine and upright positions, with a consistent interval between its two components, argues in favor of an atrial septal defect.\n38. S2 that becomes audibly split only in exhalation, while remaining single in inspiration (paradoxical or reversed splitting), means pathology until proven otherwise. This is usually an increased impedance to left ventricular emptying (aortic stenosis [AS], coarctation, or hypertension), a left bundle branch block, or a transient, left ventricular ischemia.\n39. A loud and ringing S2, rich in overtones and tambour-like (“drum” in French), indicates a dilation of the aortic root. When associated with an AR murmur, it suggests Marfan syndrome, syphilis (Potain’s sign), or a dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta (Harvey’s sign).\n40. S3 is such an accurate predictor of systolic dysfunction (and elevated atrial pressure) that its absence argues in favor of an ejection fraction \u003e30%.\n41. In patients with congestive heart failure, S3 is the best predictor for response to digitalis and overall mortality. It correlates with high levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and if associated with elevated jugular venous pressure, it predicts more frequent hospitalizations and worse outcome. S3 is also the most significant predictor of cardiac risk during noncardiac surgery. If preoperative diuresis is not instituted, it can also predict mortality. Finally, the presence of S3 in MR reflects worse disease (i.e., higher filling pressure, lower ejection fraction, and more severe regurgitation).\n42. S4 reflects an increase in late ventricular diastolic pressure (hence a diastolic dysfunction); but, in contrast to S3, it reflects normal atrial pressure, normal cardiac output, and normal ventricular diameter.\n43. S4 can be heard in as many as 90% of patients with MI, but eventually resolves. Presence of S4 at more than 1 month after MI does predict a higher 5-year mortality rate.\n44. An early systolic (ejection) sound indicates normal ejection of blood through an abnormal aortic valve (i.e., bicuspid), normal ejection of blood into a stiffened and dilated aortic root (i.e., hypertension, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, or AR, or forceful ejection of blood into a normal aortic root (high output states like AR)).\n45. An aortic ejection sound in patients with AR argues in favor of valvular AR, possibly due to a bicuspid valve.\n46. In mitral valve prolapse (MVP), clickers stay clickers and murmurers stay murmurers.\n47. One-tenth of all rubs are associated with a pericardial effusion. In fact, rubs can occur in up to one-fourth of tamponade cases. Hence, measure pulsus paradoxus in all patients with a rub.\n48. All right-sided auscultatory findings (except the pulmonic ejection sound) get louder on inspiration (Rivero Carvallo maneuver).\n49. A murmur that intensifies with Valsalva or squatting-to-standing is due to either HOCM or MVP.\n50. A longer diastolic pause (such as that following a premature beat) intensifies the murmur of AS but not that of MR.\n51. A benign “functional” murmur should be systolic, short, soft (typically \u003c3/6), early peaking (never passing midsystole), predominantly circumscribed to the base, and associated with a well-preserved and normally split-second sound. It should have an otherwise normal cardiovascular exam (i.e., no bad company); and it often disappears with sitting, standing, or straining (as, for example, following a Valsalva maneuver).\n52. A “bad” systolic murmur instead should be long, loud (in fact, pathologic by definition if loud enough to generate a thrill), late peaking, nonlocalized, and associated with a soft-to-absent S2 that does not normally split. It also should be accompanied by other abnormal findings/symptoms (“bad” company).\n53. The murmur of aortic sclerosis is the most common systolic ejection murmur of the elderly, affecting 21%–26% of persons older than 65 and 55%–75% of octogenarians and carrying a 40% increased risk of MI.\n54. Presence of an early systolic (ejection) click in AS usually indicates a valvular AS, typically due to a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve.\n55. Some patients with AS may exhibit a dissociation of the systolic murmur into two components, with medium frequencies transmitted to the base and high frequencies to the apex, almost mimicking MR (Gallavardin phenomenon).\n56. Findings arguing most strongly in favor of AS are a reduced/delayed carotid upstroke, a mid-to-late peak of the murmur, a soft-to-absent A2, a palpable precordial thrill, and an apical-carotid (or brachioradial) delay. Conversely, lack of radiation to the right carotid artery argues most strongly against AS. A normal rate of rise of the arterial pulse argues also against the presence of significant AS, but only in the young.\n57. The best bedside predictors for severity/clinical outcome of AS are (1) murmur intensity and timing (the louder and later-peaking the murmur, the worse the disease); (2) a single S2; and (3) delayed upstroke/reduced amplitude of the carotid pulse (pulsus parvus and tardus). Still, no single physical finding has both high sensitivity and specificity for detecting severe valvular obstruction.\n58. Presence of an audible S4 in AS reflects severe left ventricular hypertrophy (with a transvalvular pressure gradient \u003e70 mmHg), but only in younger patients (older subjects may already have a “normal” S4). Yet, a palpable S4 always reflects severe disease.\n59. In cardiac auscultation, the louder (and the longer) the murmur, the worse the underlying disease. The only exception is severe AS with decreased cardiac output.\n60. Plateau MR murmurs are more likely to be rheumatic, whereas murmurs that start in midsystole and “grow” into S2 are more likely to be due to either MVP or papillary muscle dysfunction.\n61. The acute MR murmur is often early systolic (exclusively so in 40% of cases) and is associated with S4 in 80% of the patients.\n62. Valvular AR tends to be loudest over the Erb’s point (left parasternal area), whereas “root” AR is loudest over the aortic area (right parasternal area).\n63. The Austin-Flint murmur may occur in more than 50% of moderate to severe AR cases, usually requiring a regurgitant volume of at least 50 mL.\n64. A palpable pulsus bisferiens usually reflects moderate to severe AR (with or without AS).\n65. A difference in systolic pressure \u003e60 mmHg between upper and lower extremities (Hill’s sign) has high specificity and a very high positive LR for severe AR, but a sensitivity of only 40%. So do a diastolic blood pressure \u003e50 mmHg and a pulse pressure ≥80 mmHg.\n66. Traube pistol shot sound(s) and Duroziez double murmur have sensitivity of 37%–55% for AR and specificity of 63%–98%. Neither predicts severity.\n67. The alternate reddening and blanching of the fingernails, coinciding with each cardiac cycle and easily visualized by lightly compressing the nail bed with a glass slide (Quincke’s pulse), is one of the many peripheral signs of AR, albeit a nonspecific and vastly discredited one.\n68. You diagnose AR in diastole, but you assess its severity in systole (through the presence of a flow murmur and possibly an ejection click). Conversely, you diagnose MR in systole, but you assess its severity in diastole (through the presence of an S3 and possibly a diastolic flow rumble).\n69. Tachypnea is so frequent in pulmonary embolism (92% of patients) that a normal respiratory rate argues strongly against the diagnosis.\n70. Unlike orthopnea, platypnea (an obligatory “supine respiration”) is usually due to a right-to-left shunt. This can be either intracardiac or intrapulmonary (typically bibasilar and common in cirrhotic patients – hepatopulmonary syndrome).\n71. Abdominal paradox has high sensitivity (95%) and good specificity (71%) for impending respiratory failure, usually preceding arterial blood gases’ deterioration.\n72. Upward inspiratory motion of the clavicle in excess of 5 mm is a valuable sign of severe obstructive disease, correlating with a forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 of 0.6 L.\n73. The distance between the top of the thyroid cartilage and the suprasternal notch (laryngeal height) is a strong predictor of postoperative pulmonary risk if ≤4 cm.\n74. The forced expiratory time (FET) is the best bedside predictor of the severity of airflow obstruction. FETo \u003e6 seconds corresponds to an FEV1/FVC \u003c40%. Conversely, FETo \u003c5 seconds indicates an FEV1/FVC \u003e60%.\n75. Crackles (and rhonchi) that clear with coughing suggest airflow obstruction. Conversely, crackles that appear after coughing (posttussive crackles) argue in favor of tuberculosis.\n76. Bronchial breath sounds reflect patent airways in a setting of absent alveolar air, with replacement by media that better transmit higher frequencies, such as liquids or solids (consolidation). If unaccompanied by crackles, they argue in favor of a pleural effusion.\n77. Late inspiratory crackles can be detected by careful auscultation in 63% of young and healthy nursing students (in 92% if using an electronic stethoscope with high-pass filtration).\n78. Timing of crackles predicts the site of production, with early inspiratory crackles reflecting bronchitis, mid-inspiratory crackles reflecting bronchiectasis, and late inspiratory crackles reflecting interstitial fibrosis or edema.\n79. In asbestosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the number of late inspiratory crackles correlates with disease severity.\n80. In patients with pneumonia, crackles and diminished breath sounds appear first; bronchial breath sounds and egophony develop 1–3 days after onset of symptoms (i.e., cough and fever), and dullness to percussion (plus increased tactile fremitus) occurs even later. This time lag usually allows for x-ray to preempt diagnosis, thus making an exam often irrelevant.\n81. Wheezing on maximal forced exhalation has such a low sensitivity and specificity for asthma (57% and 37%, respectively) as to be completely unreliable for diagnosing subclinical airflow obstruction.\n82. Wheezes are neither sensitive nor specific for airflow obstruction. Although unforced wheezing argues strongly for chronic airflow obstruction, it can be absent in 30% of patients with FEV1 \u003c1 L. It may also resolve in acute asthmatics whose FEV1 remains at 63% of the predicted value. In fact, in status asthmaticus, wheezing is the least-discriminating factor in predicting hospital admission or relapse.\n83. Wheezing intensity does not correlate with severity of obstruction. Only pitch and length of wheezes are useful predictors of airway narrowing. Higher-pitched and longer wheezes reflect worse obstruction.\n84. Bowel sounds lack sensitivity and specificity for intestinal obstruction, being decreased or absent in only one-quarter of cases. Hence, they are clinically useless.\n85. Lateral expansion of an abdominal mass \u003e3 cm with pulsation suggests an abdominal aortic aneurysm. In cases of small aneurysms (3–5 cm in diameter), the finding is very specific, with the few false positives usually reflecting a tortuous aorta (yet, the finding is also poorly sensitive, detecting only one of five cases). In patients with large aneurysms (\u003e5 cm), sensitivity increases to four out of five patients. In fact, lack of expansile pulsation in a thin patient should strongly argue against the presence of a large aneurysm.\n86. Palpation of the liver edge is an unreliable way to estimate hepatic consistency. In fact, half of all palpable livers are not enlarged, and half of truly enlarged livers are not palpable.\n87. A pulsatile liver edge may represent transmission of aortic pulsations through an enlarged liver but usually indicates one of two conditions: (1) constrictive pericarditis or (2) tricuspid regurgitation (TR). An inspiratory increase in the magnitude of pulsations will be typical of TR (especially in held mid-inspiration/end-inspiration), but not of constrictive pericarditis. Pulsatility in a setting of hepatomegaly instead is such a good indicator of constrictive pericarditis (present in 65% of patients) that its absence argues strongly against the diagnosis.\n88. A painful arrest in inspiration triggered by palpation of the edge of an inflamed gallbladder (Murphy’s sign) is a good test for cholecystitis, with sensitivity and specificity of 50%–80% (specificity usually a little higher than sensitivity).\n89. A palpable and nontender gallbladder in icteric patients strongly suggests that the jaundice is not due to hepatocellular disease, but to an extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tract, more likely neoplastic. Albeit not too sensitive, this finding is highly specific.\n90. In patients with splenomegaly, (1) concomitant hepatomegaly suggests primary liver disease with portal hypertension; (2) concomitant lymphadenopathy excludes primary liver disease and makes instead hematologic or lymphoproliferative disorders more likely; (3) massive splenomegaly (or left upper quadrant tenderness) also argues in favor of a myeloproliferative etiology; and (4) Kehr’s sign (referred pain or hyperesthesia to the left shoulder) suggests impending splenic rupture.\n91. Half of all patients with renovascular disease have a systolic murmur, whose significance depends on location and characteristics. Overall, posterior murmurs are specific but not sensitive; anterior murmurs are sensitive but not specific; anterior bruits (i.e., continuous murmurs) are both specific and sensitive.\n92. Combining all bedside maneuvers provides a good bedside tool for the diagnosis of ascites, with overall accuracy of 80%. Still, the amount of volume necessary for these maneuvers to become positive (500–1000 mL) is much larger than that detected by ultrasound alone (100 mL).\n93. Generalized adenopathy suggests a disseminated malignancy (especially hematologic), a collagen vascular disorder, or an infectious process. Adenopathy presenting with fever usually suggests infection or lymphoma.\n94. A palpable supraclavicular node carries a 90% risk of malignancy for patients older than 40 years, and a 25% risk for younger patients.\n95. A cranial nerve (CN) III palsy that spares pupils (i.e., ptosis and external rotation of the globe, but symmetric and equally reactive pupils) suggests diabetes, but also vasculitides and multiple sclerosis.\n96. In a meta-analysis of almost 2000 patients, the signs with highest LRs for predicting neurologic recovery after a cardiac arrest were, at 24 hours: absent corneal reflexes (LR 12.9); absent pupillary reflexes (LR 10.2); absent motor response (LR 4.9); and absent withdrawal to pain (LR 4.7). At 72 hours, absent motor response predicted death or poor neurologic outcome.\n97. Many traditional findings in carpal tunnel syndrome, including Phalen, Tinel, and flick sign, have low sensitivity and limited or no value.\n98. A positive straight-leg-raising test indicates nerve root impingement, usually by a herniated disk. It has high sensitivity (91%) but low specificity (26%), thus limiting its diagnostic accuracy. The “crossed” straight-leg raising test instead has low sensitivity (29%) but high specificity (88%). Hence, use them together.\n99. A composite examination for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries has sensitivity \u003e82% and specificity \u003e94%, with an LR of 25.0 for a positive examination and 0.04 for a negative one. Overall, a positive Lachman test argues strongly in favor of an ACL tear, whereas a negative is fairly good evidence against it. The anterior drawer is the least accurate test.\n100. A composite examination for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries has sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 98%, and LRs of 21.0 (for a positive exam) and 0.05 (for a negative one). The posterior drawer test is the most reliable indicator, with mean sensitivity of 55%.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.276192651Z","tags":null},"/Physical-exam-acute-bacterial-meningitis":{"title":"Physical exam-acute bacterial meningitis","content":"# Physical exam-acute bacterial meningitis\n- Brudzinski and Kernig signs of meningeal irritation appear unreliable for diagnosis or ruling out of meningitis.\n- 低sensitvity aka 有病的只有少數有陽\n- 高specificity aka 沒病的大多為陰， 但不代表為陰就是沒病\n\n- (CID 2002;35:46; Am J Emerg Med 2013;31:1601)\n\n- Nuchal rigidity (Se 30%, Sp 68%), Kernig’s sign (Se 5%, Sp 95%), Brudzinski’s sign (Se 5%, Sp 95%), jolt sign (HA worsens w/ horizontal rotation) (Se 64%, Sp 43%)\n- ± Focal neuro findings (~30%; hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field cuts, CN palsies)\n- ± HEENT findings: sinus tenderness, clear rhinorrhea (CSF leak)\n- ± Skin and joint findings:\n\t- petechial rash (N. meningitidis),\n\t- genital or oral ulcers (HSV),\n\t- arthritis with joint effusion (N. meningitidis)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.276192651Z","tags":null},"/Physical-exam-aortic-regurgitation":{"title":"Physical-exam-aortic-regurgitation","content":"# Physical-exam-aortic-regurgitation\n\n* Early diastolic decrescendo murmur at LSB (RSB if dilated Ao root); ↑ w/ sitting forward, expir, handgrip; severity of AR ∝ duration of murmur (except in acute and severe late); Austin Flint murmur: mid-to-late diastolic rumble at apex (AR jet interfering w/ mitral inflow)\n* Wide pulse pressure due to ↑ stroke volume, hyper-dynamic pulse; pulse pressure narrows in late AR with ↓ LV fxn; bisferiens (twice-beating) arterial pulse\n* PMI diffuse and laterally displaced; soft S1 (early closure of MV); ± S3 (≠ ↓ EF but rather just volume overload in AR)\n\n![Heart sound](https://i.imgur.com/nkng17l.png)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.276192651Z","tags":null},"/Physical-exam-aortic-stenosis":{"title":"Physical-exam-aortic-stenosis","content":"# Physical-exam-aortic-stenosis\n\n* Midsystolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at RUSB, harsh, high-pitched, radiates to carotids, apex (holosystolic = Gallavardin effect), ↑ w/ passive leg raise, ↓ w/ standing \u0026 Valsalva.

At least it is not difficult to obtain a basic understanding of the art — and *apply* this understanding to interpreting the *majority* of 12-lead ECGs and arrhythmias that you will encounter. The most difficult part of electrocardiography is learning \\(*and then remembering*\\) the various criteria used to diagnose complex ECG findings such as chamber enlargement and bundle branch block.\n\n+ Practically speaking — ***there is much less to learn ***\\(*and memorize*\\)**** ***than most people think***. Herein lies the *secret* of the ECG *Pocket *Brain: it facilitates understanding of basic ECG concepts and *lightens* the \"memory load\" — by providing *ready* recall of those *KEY* facts and figures needed for successful 12-lead interpretation. \n+ We have ***completely *****revised** and ***updated*** this **6th Edition** \\(2014\\) of our book. We have more than doubled our content — enhanced our explanations — and have greatly improved the quality of our figures. This book now stands as an *independent* concise text on key aspects of ECG interpretation. \n+ ***Development*** of ***this*** **ePub** takes ECG-2014-PB \\(*Expanded*\\) to a *higher* level. Nothing beats the instant access of a well organized electronic file. \n\n \n\n\n\nOur goal is *to provide key information fast*. Near-instant access is now possible with this electronic ePub. We suggest you begin your review of ECG-2014-ePub by an overview of our **CONTENTS** at the *front* of this ePub.\n\n+ There are *immediate* links to *each* subsection in our Contents. \n+ Instant search and localization is facilitated by our new ***numbering*** **system**. For example — *typing in* **05.0** in the Search bar *instantly* brings up *all* places in this ePub where reference to Section 05.0 on Bundle Branch Block is found. \n\n \n\n**NOTE-1:** This ePub book begins in Section 01.0 with *Review of Basics*. We have *intentionally* placed our **ECG** ***Crib***** Sheet** in **Section 00.6** *before* Section 01.0 — so that it will be *easy* to find.\n\n+ For readers who are *less* experienced in *systematic* ECG interpretation — We suggest you refer to the ECG Crib Sheet often. Doing so will facilitate ready recall of the 6 *KEY* parameters \\(*of Rate-Rhythm-Intervals-Axis-Hypertrophy-QRST Changes*\\). \n+ **HINT:** Making a bookmark — ***Searching*** for, “**00.6**” — or simply *scrolling* to the front of this ePub are *easy* ways to rapidly access the ECG Crib Sheet. \n+ *Please CHECK OUT our ECG Crib Sheet\\!* \n\n \n\n**NOTE-2:** We have placed review of the **6** ***Essential***** Lists** in **Section 00.7**.

We *intentionally* place this **ECG** ***Crib***** Sheet** *before* Section 01.0 — so that it will be *easy* to access.\n\n+ For readers who are *less* experienced in *systematic* ECG interpretation — We suggest you refer **often** to this ECG Crib Sheet. This will **facilitate** ***ready***** recall** of the 6 *KEY* parameters in the ***Systematic*** **Approach** \\(*= Rate-Rhythm-Intervals-Axis-Hypertrophy-QRST Changes*\\). \n+ With *regular* use — You’ll *quickly* learn the information contained within this ECG Crib Sheet. In case there is something you forget — the Crib Sheet is always here for a quick refresher. \n+ **HINT:** Making a bookmark — ***Searching*** for, “**00.6**” — or simply *scrolling* to the front of this ePub are *easy* ways to rapidly access the ECG Crib Sheet. \n+ **NOTE:** *All* parameters in our *Systematic* Approach to ECG interpretation are discussed in detail throughout the pages of this ePub. We begin with **Section 01.0** on *Review of Basics* — and continue through to Section 14.0. ***We simply want you to know*** that this ECG *Crib* Sheet \\(*Section 00.6*\\) and Section 00.7 that follows \\(*which reviews the 6 Essential Lists*\\) — are ***located*** at the very ***front*** of this **ePub** in order to facilitate your *ready* access to this material. \n\n \n\n**00.6.2 – The** ***Systematic***** Approach:** ***Rate \u0026 Rhythm***\n\n+ The first 2 parameters in the ***Systematic*** **Approach** are Rate and Rhythm. They are discussed in detail in **Section 02.0**. \n\n \n\n**RATE** — If the rhythm is regular — ***rate*** can easily be determined by the “Rule of 300”. Divide 300 by the number of boxes in R-R Interval \\(*Section 02.2*\\).\n\n+ IF the rhythm is ***regular*** and **rapid** — rate can be accurately estimated by the *every-other-beat* method \\(*Section 02.31*\\) — in which you figure out the rate for every-other-beat \\(*which is half the rate*\\); and then *double* this number. \n\n \n\n**RHYTHM** — First ***ensure*** that the patient is ***hemodynamically*** **stable**. Then assess the 5 *KEY* components for rhythm. These are conveniently remembered by the phrase: ***Watch your *****P's***** \u0026 *****Q's***** — and the *****3 R's** \\(*Section 02.1*\\).\n\n+ Are there **P waves**? If so — Are P waves ***upright*** in **lead II?** \n+ P waves should *always* be ***upright*** in **lead II** IF there is sinus rhythm \\(*unless there is lead reversal or dextrocardia*\\). \n+ Is the **QRS** complex wide or narrow? \n+ What is the **Rate**? \n+ Is the rhythm **Regular**? \n+ Are P waves **Related** \\(ie, *\"married\" with fixed PR interval*\\) to the QRS? If P waves are “married” — then they are being conducted to the ventricles. \n\n \n\n**00.6.3 – Parameter \\#3:** ***Intervals***\n\n**INTERVALS** — Look at intervals at an *early* point in the process\\!\n\n+ The **PR Interval** — is *prolonged* IF \u003e0.20-0.21 second \\(*if clearly more than a LARGE box in duration*\\) — *Section 04.0*. \n+ The **QRS Complex** — is *wide* IF \u003e0.10 sec. \\(*if more than HALF a large *box in duration\\) — *Section 05.0*. \n+ The **QT Interval** — is *prolonged *IF clearly *more* than *half* the R-R interval \\(*provided that heart rate is not more than 100 beats/minute*\\) — *Section 06.0*. If the QT interval is prolonged — Think of *“Drugs-Lytes-CNS” *\\(= **List \\#3**\\) as the possible cause\\(s\\) of QT prolongation \\(*Section 06.2*\\). \n\n \n\n***KEY Clinical Point:*** **—** IF the rhythm is sinus but the QRS is wide — then ***STOP*** *before* going further. Figure out *WHY* the QRS is wide — be this due to RBBB, LBBB, IVCD, WPW \\(*Section 05.2*\\). Criteria for infarction, ischemia, and chamber enlargement will all be *different* IF there is a conduction defect. This is the reason for determining *early on* the cause of QRS widening.\n\n**00.6.4 – Parameter \\#4:** ***Axis***\n\n+ Axis is discussed in detail in **Section 07.0**. \n\n \n\n**AXIS** **—*** *Determine the axis quadrant by looking at* ***lead I \\(***at 0 degrees***\\)** and **lead aVF** **\\(***at \\+90 degrees***\\)**:\n\n+ The axis is ***normal ****—* IF the *net* QRS deflection is *positive* in leads I and aVF \\(*this defines the axis to be between 0 degrees to \\+90 degrees*\\). \n+ There is **RAD** *—**** ***IF the *net* QRS deflection is *negative* in I but *positive* in aVF \\(*Think RVH, LPHB or normal variant as the common causes for RAD*\\). \n+ There is **LAD** *—* IF the *net* QRS is *positive* in I but *negative* in aVF. There is *pathologic LAD *= **LAHB** \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\)**** — IF the *net* QRS deflection is more *negative* than positive in lead II \\(*Section 07.13*\\). \n+ The axis is ***indeterminate — ***IF the *net* QRS deflection is *negative* in leads I and aVF \\(*Think RVH, COPD, obesity as the common causes of an indeterminate axis*\\). \n\n \n\n**00.6.5 – Parameter \\#5:** ***Chamber Enlargement*******\n\n+ Chamber Enlargement is discussed in detail in **Section 08.0**. \n\n \n\n**HYPERTROPHY** \\(*Chamber Enlargement*\\):\n\n+ The \"*magic numbers\"* for **LVH** are **35** \\(sum of the *deepest* S wave in V1,V2**** — ***plus ****— *the *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 — *in a patient at least**** 35 ****years of age*\\) — and **12** \\(*for R wave amplitude in lead aVL*\\) — *Section 08.1*. True chamber enlargement is *much* more likely IF ***\"strain\"******* also present\\! \n+ There is **RAA** \\(*P Pulmonale*\\) —**** IF P waves are **p**rominent \\(*≥2.5 mm tall*\\) and **p**eaked \\(ie, *\"uncomfortable to sit on\"*\\) in the ***p****ulmonary* leads \\(*II, III, and aVF*\\) — *Section 08.19*. \n+ There is **LAA** \\(*P Mitrale*\\) — IF P waves are *notched* \\(*\"m\"-shaped*\\) in **m**itral leads \\(*I, II, or aVL*\\) — or if the P wave in V1 has a *deep* terminal *negative* component — *Section 08.20*. \n+ Consider ***pulmonary***** disease** — IF there is RAA, RAD \\(*or indeterminate axis*\\), incomplete RBBB \\(*or rSr’ pattern in lead V1*\\), low voltage, or persistent precordial S waves — *Section 08.24*. \n+ Consider **RVH** — IF there is *also* a tall R wave in V1 *and/or* right ventricular \"strain\" — *Section 08.24*. \n+ Criteria for LVH/RVH are *different* when there is BBB \\(*Sections 05.31 and 05.32*\\). \n+ Consider **acute** ***pulmonary***** embolus** — IF the ECG shows signs of acute *right* heart strain \\(*Section 08.34*\\). \n\n \n\n**00.6.6 – Parameter \\#6:** ***Infarct *****\\(= Q-R-S-T Changes\\)**\n\n+ Assessment of QRST Changes is discussed in detail in **Section 09.0**. \n\n \n\n**INFARCT** **\\(***= ****Q-R-S-T ****changes***\\)** — Look at *all* 12 leads on the ECG to assess for QRST Changes.\n\n+ **Lead** **aVR** will usually be ***globally***** negative** under *normal* circumstances \\(*negative P wave, QRS and T wave*\\). We therefore *expect* to see a Q wave and T wave inversion in lead aVR as part of a normal ECG. \n+ The finding of an *upright* P, QRS and T wave in lead aVR should suggest the possibility of ***lead*** **misplacement** \\(*especially if lead I manifests global negativity*\\) — *Section 03.10*. \n+ For the *more* experienced interpreter — We suggest review of Sections 09.31-through-09.39, which highlight situations for which **attention** to ***lead*** **aVR** may provide important additional information. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** *Localization* of the ***Basic***** Lead Groups** is shown in Figure 00.6.6-1. Lead localization is discussed in detail in Section 09.4.\n\n\n\n**Figure 00.6.6-1:** Basic Lead Groups.\n\n***Assessment*** of **Q-R-S-T Changes**:\n\n+ **Q Waves** —**** Small and normal* ****septal *****q waves** are commonly seen in one or more of the *lateral* leads \\(***I****,****aVL****,V4,****V5,V6***\\). \n+ ***Moderate*** or ***large-sized*** **Q waves** may be **normal** —**** IF**** they occur as an *isolated* finding in *one or more *of the following leads: leads III, aVF, aVL, *and/or* V1. Figure 00.6.6-2 suggests that thinking of a ***reverse*** **Z** \\(*as in Zorro*\\) —**** may help recall *which* leads may *normally* manifest a large *isolated* Q wave \\(*Section 09.12*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.6.6-2:** *Reverse* Z memory aid \\(*Q waves/T inversion*\\).\n\n+ **R Wave Progression** —**** Does ***transition*** occur as it normally should *between* leads V2-to-V4? \\(Figure 00.6.6-3 —**** *Section 09.5*\\). \n+ Is there a* ****Tall R *****in Lead V1? = List \\#6** \\(*Section 10.47*\\). \n+ Normally* *the QRS is predominantly *negative* in *right-sided* lead V1. Is there an* ****rSr’ *****pattern** in **lead V1**? \\(*which could be a normal variant or incomplete RBBB*\\) — *Section 05.18*. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.6.6-3:** Precordial lead placement. Normal R wave progression.\n\n+ **ST Segments** —**** Judge ST segment deviation \\(*elevation or depression*\\)**** with respect to the PR segment baseline \\(*Section 09.25*\\). Much more than the *amount* of ST segment deviation — Focus on *shape* \\(***\"smiley\" ***or*** \"frowny****”*\\). \n+ **T Waves** —**** May *normally* be inverted in leads **III**, **aVF**, **aVL** *and/or* **V1**. Note that these are the *same* leads that may normally manifest *isolated* Q waves \\(Figure 00.6.6-2\\). \n+ Remember that criteria for ischemia/infarction are *different* when there is BBB \\(*Sections 05.24-through-05.29*\\). \n\n \n\n**00.6.7 –** ***Suggested***** Approach:** ***Systematic ECG Interpretation*******\n\nAs we discuss in **Section 01.0** — Use the elements in Sections 00.6.2 *through* 00.6.6 as a *guide* for ***descriptive***** analysis**; then formulate your **clinical** ***impression***. Whenever possible — *WRITE *OUT \\(*or at least think out*\\) your findings. Above all, even when time is short — *BE systematic\\!*\n\n\n\n\n\n**Section 00.7 – The 6 Essential Lists**\n\n\n\n**00.7.1 – The 6 Lists:** ***What They Are …***\n\nWe have developed **6** ***Essential *****“Lists”** to remember for optimal ECG and arrhythmia interpretation. The purpose of a “List” — is that it readily recalls the most common/important causes to remember for the particular entity. For example — as soon as you recognize that the QT interval is prolonged — *Think “Drugs-Lytes-CNS” as possible causes *\\(= LIST \\#3\\).\n\n+ We intentionally *limit* the number \\(*and length*\\) of our lists so as *not *to overwhelm. Use of these 6 Lists will prove *invaluable *to you in *saving* time and improving the *accuracy* of your interpretation. \n+ You will want to refer to these 6 Lists often until you know them by heart. With *minimal* practice — they will be *easy* to remember\\! \n\n \n\nFor clarity \\(*and easy reference*\\) — we reproduce the 6 Lists here. You’ll find them again *intermingled* with relevant content *throughout* this electronic file.\n\n+ **HINT:** Making a bookmark — ***Searching*** for, “**00.7**” — or simply *scrolling* to the front of this ePub are *convenient* ways to instantly access the 6 Essential Lists \\(*The 6 Lists are found just after the ECG Crib Sheet*\\). \n\n \n\n**00.7.2 – LIST \\#1: The** ***Common***** Causes of a** ***Regular *****WCT:**\n\n+ LIST \\#1 is discussed in detail in Section 02.47. \n+ *KEY Point:* The 1st thing to do in assessment of *any* tachycardia — is to **ensure** ***hemodynamic***** stability**. IF the patient is unstable — *immediately* cardiovert\\! But IF the patient in WCT \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\) is stable — you have at least a *moment *of time to contemplate management. \n+ Always ***assume*** a *regular* WCT rhythm is **VT** ***until***** proven otherwise** \\(Figure 00.7.2-1\\). This is true *regardless* of whether the patient is hypotensive or alert with a systolic BP\u003e160mmHg. Some patients may be stable and alert *despite* remaining in VT for hours \\(*or even days*\\)\\! \n+ The reason we list **VT** as the ***first***** 8 causes** in **LIST \\#1** \\(Figure 00.7.2-1\\) is twofold: **i\\)** VT is the *worst* thing the WCT could be; and **ii\\)** Statistically — *at least* 80-90% of cases of WCT of *uncertain* etiology will turn out to be VT. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.2-1:** LIST \\#1 = Causes of a Monomorphic *Regular* WCT. Always *assume* VT until *proven* otherwise.\n\n**00.7.3 – LIST \\#2: Common Causes of a** ***Regular *****SVT:**\n\n+ LIST \\#2 is discussed in detail in Section 02.52. \n+ We define the term, **“SVT”** — as a *rapid* rhythm \\(*rate \u003e100/minute*\\) in which the **QRS** complex is **narrow** \\(*not more than 0.10 second*\\) in *all* 12 leads. The **3 entities** included in **LIST \\#2** \\(Figure 00.7.3-1\\) make up *over* 90% of the causes of a ***regular***** SVT** seen by primary care or emergency providers. \n\n \n\nAwareness of the **usual** ***rate***** ranges** for these 3 common causes of SVT may help with distinction between them:\n\n+ ***Sinus*** **Tachycardia** — *rarely *exceeds 160/minute in adults \\(*children may have sinus tachycardia at much faster rates*\\). \n+ ***Untreated *****Atrial** **Flutter** —* *usually conducts with **2:1 ratio**. Since the atrial rate of *untreated* atrial flutter is almost always *close* to **300/minute** \\(*250-350/minute is the range*\\) —* *this means that the *ventricular* response to AFlutter will usually be ***between*** **140-to-160/minute**. \n+ As a result — IF a *regular *SVT in an adult is *faster than* 160-170/minute — it is most likely to be PSVT \\(*= AVNRT = AtrioVentricular Nodal Reentry Tachycardia*\\). \n+ On the other hand —* *A *regular* SVT rhythm at a rate *under* 160-170/minute could be *any* of the 3 entities on LIST \\#2 \\(Fig. 00.7.3-1\\). \n+ **NOTE:** A ***vagal*** **maneuver** or use of Adenosine* *\\(*= chemical Valsalva*\\) — may help in making a definitive diagnosis. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.3-1:** LIST \\#2 = Causes of a *Regular* SVT.\n\n**00.7.4 – LIST \\#3: Common Causes of QT Prolongation:**\n\n+ LIST \\#3 is discussed in detail in Section 06.2. \n+ Be aware that *in addition* to the **3 entities** in **LIST \\#3** \\(Figure 00.7.4-1\\) — ischemia/MI/BBB may *all* lengthen the QT. That said — IF the *only* ECG abnormality on the tracing is a *long *QT — *Think ****“Drugs-Lytes-CNS”*** as the likely cause. Then — *correlate* clinically. \n+ **NOTE:** Many ***combinations*** of **drugs** may contribute to *lengthening* the QT interval. These potential *drug-drug* interactions extend *beyond* the scope of this ECG-ePub and are *not* reflected in List \\#3. Suffice it to say that risk of QT prolongation \\(*and risk of Torsades*\\) is generally *minimal* — IF an otherwise *healthy* adult takes a *single* new drug for a *limited* period of time. Risk goes up when *several* agents are taken — especially if the drugs utilize the p450 system for metabolism and the patient has other *underlying* medical problems that may *predispose* to Torsades. **BOTTOM Line:** Consider the possibility of **Drugs** \\(*or drug-drug interactions*\\) — as one of the main clinical causes of QT prolongation. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.4-1:** LIST \\#3 = Causes of a *Prolonged* QT.\n\n**00.7.5 – LIST \\#4: Common Causes of ST Segment Depression:**\n\n+ LIST \\#4 is discussed in detail in Section 09.26. \n+ There are *over* 50 causes of ST depression. Many of these causes are noncardiac — related to factors such as hyperventilation, temperature extremes, severe medical illness. The entities in **LIST \\#4** \\(Figure 00.7.5-1\\) — are simply the ones we feel it most important to remember. \n+ A *similar* list of entities as shown in List \\#4 may produce T wave inversion. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.5-1:** LIST \\#4 = Causes of ST Depression.\n\n**00.7.6 – LIST \\#5: Causes of** ***Anterior***** ST Depression with** ***Inferior *****MI:**\n\n+ LIST \\#5 is discussed in detail in Section 10.42. \n+ Use of** LIST \\#5** \\(Figure 00.7.6-1\\) is *limited* to the setting of **acute** ***inferior***** STEMI**. The purpose of List \\#5 is to remind us of the **3** ***common***** causes** of ***anterior***** ST depression** in this situation. \n+ Helpful *General* Rule: The *more* ST depression that is seen on the ECG — the more likely the MI is both *acute* and *large*. \n+ Clinically — we may *not* be able to determine with certainty *which *of the 3 entities in List \\#5 is/are operative. *This does not matter\\!* What counts is *awareness* of a more *extensive* MI \\(*that is more likely to benefit from acute intervention*\\) — when significant *anterior* ST depression is seen in conjunction with acute *inferior* infarction. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.6-1:** LIST \\#5 = Causes of *Anterior* ST Depression in the Setting of Acute *Inferior* MI.\n\n**00.7.7 – LIST \\#6: Common Causes of a** ***Tall *****R in Lead V1:**\n\n+ LIST \\#6 is discussed in detail in Section 10.47. \n+ Normally the QRS is predominantly *negative *\\(a *QS *or *rS complex*\\) in *right-sided* lead V1. As a result, the finding of even a *relatively *tall R wave in lead V1 \\(*that equals or exceeds S wave amplitude in this lead*\\) — should prompt consideration of the 6 entities on **LIST \\#6** \\(Figure 00.7.7-1\\). \n+ Determining *which* of the 6 entities in List \\#6 is present — is decided by assessing *associated* ECG findings. A normal variant \\(*Cause \\#6*\\) should be considered *only* after the first 5 causes have been *ruled out*. \n+ *Not* all patients need an Echo. On occasion, however — an Echo may be needed to *rule out* structural heart disease \\(*especially if hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a consideration*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 00.7.7-1:** LIST \\#6 = Causes of a *Tall* R Wave in Lead V1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Section 01.0 – Review of Basics**\n\n\n\n**01.1 –** ***Systematic***** Approach to 12-Lead ECG Interpretation**\n\nThe *KEY* to interpretation of *any* ECG is to utilize a ***Systematic*** **Approach**. The approach we suggest for interpreting each 12-lead ECG you encounter entails ***sequential**** ***systematic** **assessment** of the following parameters:\n\n+ **R**ate \n+ **R**hythm \n+ **I**ntervals **\\(***PR/QRS/QT ***\\)** \n+ **A**xis \n+ **H**ypertrophy \n+ **I**nfarct **\\(***QRST changes* **\\)** \n\n \n\nWe outline *KEY* elements to assess for each of the above parameters on our ***ECG Crib Sheet*** \\(*See Section 00.6*\\). Discussion here is limited to the following:\n\n+ The **purpose** of having \\(*and regularly using*\\) a *sequential* systematic approach is simple: It provides you with an *easy-to-remember* mental checklist that ***prevents*** you from ***overlooking*** potentially important findings. \n+ Additional benefits include increased ***accuracy***, improved organization, and surprisingly — *increased ****speed*** in completing your interpretation. With *regular* use — applying the system soon ***becomes***** automatic\\!** \n\n \n\n**01.2 – The 2 Steps to** ***Systematic***** Interpretation**\n\nThe process of 12-lead ECG interpretation should be thought of as consisting of ***two***** major steps**. The secret to successful interpretation depends on ***keep****ing* these 2 steps ***separate*** in your mind:\n\n+ **Step \\#1** = *Descriptive* Analysis**** — is accomplished first: Simply *describe* what is seen on the tracing \\(*as per the checklist review on the ECG Crib Sheet in Section 00.6*\\). Ideally — *WRITE OUT *your findings \\(*or at least THINK out your findings if you do not have time to write them out*\\). \n+ **Step \\#2** = The *Clinical* Impression**** — should only come *after* Step \\#1 has been completed. Those *specific* findings identified in descriptive analysis should *now* be interpreted *in light of* the clinical context \\(ie, *as defined by the patient's age, presenting complaint, and additional relevant clinical history*\\). \n\n \n\n**01.3 –** ***WHY***** 2** ***Separate***** Steps for Interpretation?**\n\nReview of the*** ***ECG shown in Figure 01.3-1 provides insight as to why there is need for 2 separate steps to interpretation.\n\n\n\n**Figure 01.3-1:** How would you interpret this 12-lead ECG?\n\n**Answer to Figure 01.3-1:** We interpret the 12-lead ECG shown above by the 2-Step *Systematic* Approach:\n\nStep \\#1**** \\(***Descriptive***** Analysis**\\):\n\n+ **Rate** *and* **Rhythm** — Sinus arrhythmia at a rate of between 60-70 beats/minute. \n+ **Intervals** \\(*PR/QRS/QT*\\) — are normal. \n+ **Axis** — There is RAD \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) with a mean QRS axis of ~ \\+100 degrees. \n+ **Hypertrophy** — None. \n+ **Q-R-S-T** ***changes*** — Small **Q** waves**** in *inferolateral* leads; **R** wave progression is normal \\(*transition occurs between leads V3-4*\\); Assessment of **S**T-**T** wave changes reveals fairly deep ***symmetric***** T wave inversion** in ***anterior***** precordial leads** \\(*arrows in *Fig. 01.3-1\\). \n\n \n\nStep \\#2**** \\(***Clinical***** Impression**\\) — *It depends\\!* That is — How we would interpret the ECG in *Figure 01.3-1* will vary greatly *depending on* the ***age*** and ***clinical*** **history** of the patient.\n\n+ *Symmetric* **T wave** ***inversion*** as seen in the *anterior* leads \\(*V1,V2,V3*\\) of Fig. 01.3-1 is common in pediatric patients. In an otherwise healthy child \\(*with no heart murmur*\\) — this finding represents a *benign* normal variant \\(*referred to as a* ***Juvenile***** T Wave Pattern**\\)*.* \n+ BUT — the *same* ECG \\(*with identical T wave inversion*\\) would have to be interpreted very* differently *IF the patient in question was an *older* adult with chest pain \\(*in which case ****ischemia**** would be suggested*\\). And, if *new-onset* dyspnea was the primary concern from the history — **acute** ***pulmonary***** embolism** would also have to be considered \\(*Section 08.34*\\). \n+ *KEY Clinical Point:* ***Descriptive *****Analysis*** *is the *same* in both cases \\(= *symmetric T wave inversion in V1-to-V3*\\) — but the *Clinical Impression* is *very* different\\! \n\n \n\n***Bottom Line: —*** Keep Steps \\#1 and 2 separate in your mind. Always do *Descriptive* Analysis first\\! Then — decide on your *Clinical* Impression of the findings identified in light of the clinical situation \\(*age of patient; clinical history*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**02.0 – Rate \u0026 Rhythm**\n\n\n\n**02.1 –** ***Assessing***** the 5 Parameters of Rhythm**\n\nThe most important clinical point \\(*and the real KEY to rhythm interpretation*\\) *—* is to utilize a ***Systematic*** **Approach**. The system we favor is based on assessing the rhythm for the following 5 parameters:\n\n+ **P** waves? \n+ **QRS** width ? \n+ **R**egular rhythm ? \n+ **R**elated **\\(***P waves ****r****elated to QRS ?* **\\)** \n+ **R**ate **\\(***heart ****r****ate ?* **\\)** \n\n \n\n**Memory Aid \\(***to remember the 5 Parameters***\\)**:* *\n\n+ *\"Watch your ****P****'s and ****Q****'s —* and* *the* 3 ****R****'s\"* … \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** It does *not* matter in what *sequence* you look at these 5 parameters for rhythm *—* as long as you *always* check *each* of them *every* time you look at an ECG or rhythm strip\\! We often begin with that parameter that is *easiest* to assess \\(*be this presence of P waves, QRS width or regularity*\\).\n\n+ First — *Ensure* that the **patient** is ***hemodynamically*** **stable** \\(*precise rhythm diagnosis is of secondary importance if the patient is acutely decompensating and about to code*\\). ***Always*** ***look at the patient first*** *— before* beginning to study the rhythm. \n+ IF there is normal ***sinus*** **rhythm** — then **P** waves should be present and clearly ***upright*** in **lead II** \\(*See Section 02.3*\\). \n+ In adults, the **Q**RS is defined as ***narrow ***— IF it is **≤0.10 second** = *not* more than *HALF* a *large* box in duration \\(**Figure 02.1-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.1-1:** Is the QRS wide? Normally in adults — the QRS should *not* be more than *half* a large box in duration \\(*= not more than 0.10 second*\\).\n\n+ ***R****egularity* — Look to see IF the rhythm is regular? \n+ Determine if P waves are *\"****R****elated\"* to QRS complexes \\(ie, *conducting*\\) — Look *in front* of each QRS to see IF there is a P wave with a**** ***fixed***** PR** interval. \n+ ***R****ate* — is most easily calculated by the ***Rule*** of **300** \\(*Section 02.2*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.2 –** ***Calculating***** Rate:** ***The Rule of 300***\n\n*Provided that the rhythm is regular* — the ***Rule of 300 ***states that heart rate can be *estimated* IF you ***divide***** 300** by the **number** of ***large***** boxes** in the **R-R interval**.**** The rule is derived as follows:****\n\n+ With the ECG machine set at the standard recording speed of 25 mm/second — the time required to record each ***little*** **box** on ECG grid paper is **0.04 second** **\\(**Figure 02.2-1**\\)**. Vertically — each *little* box is 1 mm in amplitude \\(*a measurement we will use often in assessing for chamber enlargement*\\). \n+ As seen in Figure 02.2-1 — the time required to record each ***large*** **box** on ECG grid paper is **0.20 second**. That**** is**** —**** there are **5** ***little***** boxes** in each ***large***** box**, and 5 **X** 0.04 second **= 0.20 second \\(** = 1/5th of a second**\\)**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.2-1:*** Deriving* the ***“Rule of 300”*** \\(*See text*\\).\n\nThus, the time required to record** 5** ***large***** boxes** will be one *full* second \\(*0.20 X 5* = **1.0 sec**\\). IF a QRS complex occurs each large box \\(*as in *Figure 02.2-1\\) — then the R-R interval will be 0.20 second — and the ***rate*** of the rhythm is **300 beats/minute** \\(ie, *5 beats occur each second ****X**** 60 seconds/minute* =**** a rate of 300/minute\\).\n\n+ IF the R-R interval is **2** ***large*** **boxes** — then the ***rate*** will be *half* as fast \\(ie, *300 ÷ 2 = ****150**** beats/minute*\\). \n+ IF the R-R is **3** boxes, the rate = **100**/minute \\(*300/3*\\). \n+ IF the R-R is **4** boxes, the rate = **75**/min \\(*300/4*\\) … \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** — Use the ***every-other-beat***** method** when the rhythm is regular and the rate is fast \\(*See Section 02.31*\\).\n\n****\n\n**02.3 –** ***How to Define Sinus Rhythm?***\n\nBy definition \\(*under normal circumstances, assuming the heart lies in the left side of the thorax*\\) — the **P wave** should always be ***upright*** in standard **lead II** when the mechanism of the rhythm is **sinus**. This is because the overall direction of the electrical depolarization wavefront as it travels from the SA node toward the AV node and the ventricles is oriented *toward* standard lead II, which lies at \\+60 degrees in the frontal plane \\(**Panel A*** in ***Figure 02.3-1**\\).\n\n+ The *only* 2 exceptions to the above stated rule \\(ie, *when the rhythm may still be sinus *despite* a negative P wave in lead II*\\) are: **i\\)** if there is dextrocardia; or **ii\\)** if there is lead misplacement. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.3-1:*** *IF the rhythm is **sinus** — then the P wave should *always* be ***upright*** in **lead II** \\(Panel A\\). The *only* exception is IF there is *dextrocardia* or lead misplacement. Therefore — Panel B is *not* a sinus rhythm \\(*See text*\\).\n\nIn contrast to the situation with sinus rhythm — the P wave will *not* be positive \\(*upright*\\) in lead II when the electrical impulse originates from the AV node \\(**Panel B*** in *Figure 02.3-1\\). Instead — spread of atrial activation is now directed *away* from lead II.\n\n+ Therefore, with junctional beats or junctional \\(*AV nodal*\\) rhythm — a ***negative***** P wave** may be seen to precede the QRS complex in **lead II \\(**Panel B *in Fig. 02.3-1***\\)**. \n+ Alternatively \\(*with AV nodal rhythm*\\) — a negative P wave may *follow* the QRS or *no P wave at all* is seen in lead II. \n\n \n\n**02.4 – FIGURE 02.4-1:** ***Is the Rhythm Sinus?***\n\nInterpret the 3 rhythm strips shown in **Figure 02.4-1**.\n\n+ How can you tell *at a glance* IF the rhythm is sinus? \\(*Assume no dextrocardia *and* no lead misplacement*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.4-1:*** How to tell* IF the rhythm is sinus?\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.4-1:** The very ***1st *****thing** we do when assessing *any* cardiac rhythm or 12-lead ECG is to look for a lead II rhythm strip. It takes *no more* than 2 brief seconds to **look in front of** ***each***** QRS in lead II**.\n\n+ **Panel A** \\(*in* Figure 02.4-1\\)**** — Regular *upright* P waves precede each QRS with *fixed* PR interval in this lead II. Therefore — there is **NSR** \\(*Normal Sinus Rhythm*\\). The QRS is narrow \\(*not more than half a large box*\\) — and the ventricular rhythm is regular with an R-R interval just *under* 4 large boxes in duration. IF the R-R interval was precisely 4 large boxes in duration — then by the ***Rule of 300*** the rate would be 300/4 = 75/minute \\(*Section 02.2*\\). Since the R-R interval is slightly *less* than 4 large boxes in duration — the rate must be slightly *faster* than 75/minute, or about **78/minute**. \n+ **Panel B** \\(*in* Figure 02.4-1\\)**** — does *not* represent sinus rhythm. It can’t \\(*provided there is no dextrocardia or lead misplacement*\\) — since the QRS in lead II is *not* preceded by an upright P wave. Whether the rhythm in Panel B represents AV nodal or low atrial rhythm is *less* important. The *KEY* point — is that the rhythm is *not* sinus\\! \n+ Otherwise — the QRS is narrow and the rhythm is regular with an R-R interval of 4 large boxes in duration. Therefore — the rate = 300/4 = **75/minute**. The *negative* P waves in this lead II *are* conducting — because the PR interval preceding each QRS is fixed\\! \n+ **Panel C** \\(*in* Figure 02.4-1\\)**** — is *not* a sinus rhythm \\(*since no P wave at all is seen*\\). The QRS is narrow and the rhythm is regular with an R-R interval of 6 large boxes. Therefore, the rate = 300/6 = **50/minute**. This is an **AV** ***nodal***** rhythm** \\(*See Sections 02.32-to 02.34*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.5 –** ***Sinus Mechanism *****Rhythms/Arrhythmias**\n\nOnce the mechanism of the rhythm is defined as “sinus” — the rate \\(*and regularity*\\) of the rhythm determine our terminology. There are 4 principal *sinus* mechanism rhythms \\(**Figure 02.5-1**\\):\n\n+ **NSR** \\(*Normal Sinus Rhythm*\\) — regular rhythm with a rate *between* 60-99/minute in an adult \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 02.5-1\\). Norms for rate differ in children \\(*Section 02.6*\\). \n+ **Sinus Bradycardia** — regular sinus rhythm at a rate *below *60/minute \\(**Panel B**\\). The rate here is 50/minute. \n+ **Sinus Tachycardia** — sinus rhythm at a rate of 100/minute or *faster* in an adult \\(**Panel C** *in Fig. 02.5-1*\\). \n+ **Sinus Arrhythmia** — an *irregular* rhythm *despite* the presence of a sinus mechanism \\(**Figure 02.7-1** — *Section 02.7*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.5-1:*** *Sinus mechanism rhythms \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.6 – Norms for Children:** ***Different than Adults***\n\nNormal limits for heart rate are *different* in children. While we primarily concern ourselves with the adult ECG in this book — it is nevertheless helpful to be aware of some differences between pediatric and adult findings.\n\n+ Rate limits are ***different*** **in children** — with “norms” depending on the age of the child. Much more important than specific “cut-off” points for each age category — is appreciation of the general concept that *slightly* faster rates \\(*say ~110/minute*\\) may be normal for a crying but otherwise healthy young child. By the same token — a rate within the “seemingly normal” range of 65/minute might be relatively *slow* for an active young child. *Clinical context is everything\\!* \n+ Upper limits for **PR** and **QRS interval duration** are also different \\(*shorter*\\) in the *smaller* pediatric heart \\(*Section 04.3*\\). \n+ Similarly —*** “Escape”***** rate ranges** differ in children. Whereas the normal **AV nodal** ***escape***** rate** in an **adult** is ***between*** **40-to-60/minute** — it is *between* 50-80/minute in a young child. Therefore, the **AV nodal rhythm** at **75/minute** seen below in **Figure 02.6-1** would be slightly *fast* IF the patient was an adult — but is clearly *within* the normal AV nodal escape rate range IF the patient is a child \\(*See also Sections 02.32-to-02.34 on AV nodal rhythms*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.6-1:*** *AV nodal rhythm at 75/minute \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.7 –** ***Sinus Arrhythmia***\n\nSinus Arrhythmia is a **common** ***normal***** variant** in infants and young children. At times, variability in sinus rate may be marked — in which case one might initially think *some other* arrhythmia is present.\n\n+ ***Sinus*** **Arrhythmia** — is confirmed by the finding of *identical-appearing* P waves that are *upright* in lead II with *fixed* PR interval \\(**Figure 02.7-1**\\). In contrast — *other* phenomena \\(*wandering atrial pacemaker; sinus rhythm with PACs*\\) will manifest changes in P wave morphology *and/or* in the PR interval. *The P waves will be different\\!* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.7-1:*** *Sinus Arrhythmia. Despite *irregularity* in the rhythm — sinus mechanism is present as defined by regularly-occurring *upright* P waves with *fixed* PR interval preceding *each* QRS complex in this lead II rhythm strip \\(*See text*\\).\n\n+ Sinus arrhythmia often exhibits ***respiratory***** variation**. This is especially true in healthy young children — for whom some variation in sinus regularity is the norm rather than the exception. Sinus “arrhythmia” is a *normal* cardiac rhythm in this setting. \n+ Some degree of sinus variability \\(ie, *sinus arrhythmia*\\) may persist in young *and even* older adults. This is *not* necessarily abnormal. *Clinical correlation is key*. \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* The ***technical*** **definition** of **sinus** ***“arrhythmia”*** — is that *sinus-initiated* R-R intervals **vary** by ***at least*** **0.08-0.12 second** \\(*2-3 little boxes*\\). This definition is clearly satisfied in Figure 02.7-1. That said, most of the time — the presence of sinus “arrhythmia” \\(*vs sinus rhythm*\\) is of *little-to-no clinical* significance.\n\n+ An ***exception*** to the statement that sinus arrhythmia is benign occurs in *older* patients with **SSS** \\(*Sick Sinus Syndrome*\\). Among the many manifestations of SSS \\(*which include sinus pauses, sinus arrest, tachy- as well as bradyarrhythmias*\\) — **sinus bradycardia** ***with***** sinus arrhythmia** is the most common. The usual course of SSS is prolonged over years \\(*if not decades*\\). Many patients who go on to develop full-fledged symptoms \\(*with need for a permanent pacemaker*\\) manifest *no more* than sinus bradycardia/sinus arrhythmia for a period of many years. Therefore — the finding of an *inappropriately* slow and *variable* sinus rhythm in an older patient with symptoms of fatigue, worsening heart failure *and/or* syncope/presyncope is cause for potential concern. IF not due to rate-slowing drugs, ischemia or hypothyroidism — *Consider SSS* as the probable cause. \n\n \n\n**02.8 – FIGURE 02.8-1:** ***What Happens to the P in Lead II?***\n\nAlthough specifics of the rhythm diagnosis in Figure 02.8-1 are advanced — the concept of routinely ***seeking*** **out** a ***long***** lead II** rhythm strip *each* time you interpret a 12-lead ECG is fundamental\\! *Always begin with this step.*\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.8-1:*** What happens* to the P wave in this lead II rhythm strip? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.8-1:** Use the **Ps, Qs \u0026 3R Approach** to assess the rhythm. As noted Section 02.1 — it does *not* matter in what *sequence* you look at the 5 parameters \\(*as long as you check them all each time you assess an ECG*\\):\n\n+ The overall rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 is *not* regular. \n+ The QRS complex is narrow. \n+ Each QRS is preceded by a P wave — BUT the *shape* of these P waves is *not* the same. The rhythm begins with a taller *peaked* P wave with fixed PR interval preceding beats \\#1,2,3; and \\#7,8. A 2nd P wave shape \\(*of smaller amplitude and notched*\\) — is then seen to precede beats \\#4,5,6. Thus, the ***underlying*** **rhythm** in Figure 02.8-1 is **sinus** ***arrhythmia*** — with *transient* change to *another* atrial focus for beats \\#4,5,6 — followed by *resumption* of the original sinus focus at the end of the tracing. \n\n \n\n***Key***** Points about Figure 02.8-1:** In our experience — the most common error in 12-lead ECG interpretation is *failure* to recognize when normal sinus rhythm is *not* present. The solution is easy:\n\n+ Ideally — there will be a *simultaneously* recorded ***long***** lead II** rhythm strip. IF so — *Begin* by:** i\\)** assessing IF the rhythm is regular; and **ii\\)** Looking to see IF P wave morphology *stays the same* throughout the rhythm strip. \n+ It suffices to recognize that the *underlying* rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 is sinus with a *change* in P wave morphology. It is *easy* to see this as long as you *consciously* look at P wave shape before *each* QRS. \n+ It is clearly more difficult *without* a long lead rhythm strip. How would you* assess the rhythm* in **Figure 02.9-1**? \n\n \n\n**02.9 – FIGURE 02.9-1:** ***When there is NO long Lead II Rhythm Strip …***\n\nThe reality is — that you will *not* always have access to a long lead rhythm strip. This was the case for the 12-lead ECG previously shown in Figure 01.3-1 \\(*Section 01.3*\\). We reproduce that 12-lead tracing below in **Figure 02.9-1**:\n\n+ How would you assess the rhythm in Figure 02.9-1? \n+ **How many** ***total***** beats** are there on this 12-lead ECG? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.9-1:*** *12-lead ECG previously shown in Figure 01.3-1. How many *total beats* are there on this tracing? What is the rhythm? Unfortunately — there is no long lead II rhythm strip \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.9-1:** The problem is that *only* 3 beats are seen in lead II of this ECG \\(*arrows*\\) before the leads switch to *simultaneous* recording of leads aVR/aVL/aVF. In addition — the R-R interval for these 3 beats that are seen in lead II is *not* the same \\(ie, *the R-R interval between beats \\#1-2 is longer than the R-R between beats \\#2-3*\\). That said, we can still diagnose the ***mechanism*** as **sinus** — because a *similarly-shaped* upright P wave with *fixed* PR interval precedes *each* of these 3 beats in lead II \\(*red arrows in* Figure 02.9-1\\).\n\n+ There are **9** ***total***** beats** on this tracing. With *simultaneous* 3-channel recordings — we get “3 looks” at each beat \\(*vertical time line in leads I – II – III* \\). The QRS is narrow. Note *irregularity* of the R-R interval for beats \\#1-*thru*-9. Thus — the rhythm is ***sinus*** **arrhythmia**. \n\n \n\n**02.10 –** ***Advanced *****POINT:** ***What is a Wandering Pacemaker?***\n\nOccasionally — the site of the atrial pacemaker may shift \\(*wander*\\) away from its usual site of origin in the SA \\(*Sino-Atrial*\\) Node. In most cases — ***wandering***** atrial pacemaker** is a benign normal variant that occurs in patients *without* underlying heart disease. It may result from *variations* in *vagal* tone \\(*that slow SA nodal discharge and allow other atrial sites to temporarily emerge*\\) — or there may be no obvious cause \\(**Figure 02.10-1**\\).\n\n+ **ECG** ***recognition*** of wandering pacer requires a *long enough* rhythm strip to appreciate ***gradual*** **change** over a period of beats from one P wave morphology to another. While possible that the rhythm in Figure 02.8-1 could reflect a wandering pacemaker — this rhythm strip is simply *not long enough* to tell. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.10-1:*** *Wandering pacemaker. Initially the P wave in lead II is an upright sinus complex \\(*1st red arrow preceding beat \\#4*\\) — with ***gradual*** **change** to an isoelectric P wave \\(*1st blue arrow preceding beat \\#5*\\) — followed by resumption of sinus rhythm with beat \\#17 \\(*2nd red arrow in bottom rhythm strip*\\). It would be *easy-to-overlook* the diagnosis of wandering pacer IF one did not pay *careful* attention to P wave morphology\\!\n\n***Bottom Line:*** True ***wandering***** atrial pacemaker** is *not* a common diagnosis. As noted — it is difficult to recognize because most 12-lead ECGs \\(*even if accompanied by a simultaneous lead II rhythm strip*\\) will simply *not* be long enough to manifest gradual transition *back-and-forth* between SA node and two or more additional atrial sites. The point to emphasize for interpreters of *any* experience level — is the need to *always* **look** ***carefully*** at **lead II** when assessing for ***atrial*** **activity**:\n\n+ Is an *upright* sinus P wave present in lead II? \n+ Does P wave morphology *change* during the rhythm? \n+ Is the underlying rhythm regular? Are there any *early* beats? \n\n \n\n**02.11 – FIGURE 02.11-1:** ***Why is this NOT Wandering Pacer?***\n\nWhile *not* yet worrying about the specific diagnosis — Why is wandering pacer *not* present in **Figure 02.11-1**?\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.11-1:*** *Why is wandering pacemaker *not* present in either of the rhythm strips shown here?\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.11-1:** The rhythm in **Panel A** is MAT \\(*See Section 02.16*\\). There are too many *different* P waves that change from *beat-to-beat* for this to be wandering pacer. In **Panel B** — the *underlying* rhythm is sinus. Beats \\#3 and \\#6 are PACs; they occur *early* — and P shape is different \\(*See Section 02.56*\\).\n\n+ True *wandering* pacemaker should manifest *gradual* transition from one P wave morphology to another — and then *either* on to yet another atrial pacemaker site or *back* to the original focus. This *gradual* transition was seen in Figure 02.10-1. It is definitely *not* seen in either Panel A or B of Figure 02.11-1. \n\n \n\n**02.12 –** ***Other *****Supraventricular Rhythms**\n\nA *supraventricular *rhythm is defined to be one in which the electrical impulse originates *at *or* above* the AV node \\(*at *or* above the double dotted line in* **Figure 02.12-1**\\).\n\n+ The “good news” — is that the ***number of sites*** from where a *supraventricular* impulse may arise is **limited**. These include: **i\\)** the SA Node; **ii\\)** from *somewhere* in the atria; or **iii\\)** the AV node. Awareness of this clinical reality greatly facilitates arrhythmia diagnosis *because* once you establish that the **QRS** complex in an adult is ***truly*** **narrow** in *all* 12 leads — you are virtually *assured* that the rhythm is supraventricular \\(*\u003e99% of the time*\\)\\! \n+ The exception \\(*occurs 0.1% of the time*\\) — in which a *narrow* QRS may arise from a *ventricular* site in an adult is IF the impulse originates from the His, fascicles or bundle branches. \n+ The above generality does *not* hold true in children \\(*the QRS is normally narrower in the smaller pediatric heart*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.12-1:*** *IF the QRS is *truly* narrow in *all* 12 leads — then for practical purposes the rhythm is ***supraventricular*** \\(*and therefore originates from *at* or *above* the double dotted red line in this Figure*\\). **NOTE:** The opposite is *not* true. That is — the etiology of a rhythm is *not* at all certain IF the QRS is wide \\(*could be either ventricular *or* supraventricular* — *See *Figure 02.13-1\\).\n\n*Other *Supraventricular Rhythms: In addition to the ***sinus***** mechanism rhythms** \\(*Section 02.5*\\) — the ***other*** principal **entities** in the ***supraventricular*** **rhythm category** include:\n\n+ AFib \\(*Atrial Fibrillation*\\) — *See Section 02.14*. \n+ MAT \\(*Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia*\\) — *See Section 02.16.* \n+ AFlutter \\(*Atrial Flutter*\\) — *See Section 02.18*. \n+ PSVT/AVNRT — *See Section 02.29*. \n+ Junctional \\(*AV nodal*\\) rhythms — *See Sections 02.32-to-02.34*. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Although there are *many* types of ***supraventricular*** **rhythms** — those listed above make up the great *majority* of rhythms that primary care and emergency providers most often will see.\n\n+ *Unless* there is *preexisting* bundle branch block or *aberrant* conduction — the **QRS** will be ***narrow*** IF the rhythm is supraventricular. \n\n \n\n**02.13 – FIGURE 02.13-1:** ***Why is this Rhythm Supraventricular?***\n\nDespite the slow rate and very *wide* QRS complex — *WHY* is the rhythm in Figure 02.13-1 supraventricular?\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.13-1:*** *Despite the wide QRS — Why is this rhythm supraventricular?\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.13-1:** By the Ps, Qs \u0026 3R Approach — We interpret the rhythm in Figure 02.13-1 as follows:\n\n+ Regular *wide* QRS rhythm at ~40/minute. \n+ *Upright* P waves precede each QRS complex with a *fixed* and normal PR interval in this lead II rhythm strip. Therefore — the rhythm is ***sinus*** **bradycardia** with **QRS widening** as a result of ***preexisting*** **BBB** \\(*Bundle Branch Block*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.14 –** ***Atrial***** Fibrillation**\n\nAFib \\(*Atrial Fibrillation*\\) — is characterized by the presence of an ***irregularly*** **irregular** rhythm in the *absence* of P waves \\(**Figure 02.14-1**\\). Undulations in the baseline \\(*known as* ***“fib” waves***\\) may sometimes be seen. Such “fib waves” are *coarse* in **Tracing B** of Fig. 02.14-1 — *fine* in **Tracing C** — and are *barely detectable* in **Tracing A**.\n\n+ As might be imagined — the diagnosis of AFib is clearly more difficult when “fib waves” are of minimal amplitude \\(*in which case diagnosis is based solely on recognizing an irregularly irregular rhythm in the absence of P waves*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.14-1:** Atrial fibrillation \\(*See text*\\).\n\n*KEY Clinical Point:* Far better than simply saying the rhythm is “AFib” — is to ***clarify*** the ***ventricular* response**. Thus, AFib will conduct with *either* a rapid, controlled, or *slow* ventricular response:\n\n+ **AFib *with*** a ***rapid* ventricular response** is present — IF the *average* rate is *over* ~120/minute \\(**Tracing A** in Fig. 02.14-1\\). *New-onset* AFib is most often rapid \\(*unless slowed by drugs, ischemia/infarction *or* sick sinus syndrome*\\). \n+ **AFib *with*** a ***controlled* ventricular response** is present — IF the *average* rate of AFib is *between* ~70-110/minute \\(**Tracing B** *in* Fig. 02.14-1\\). An important goal of medical treatment is to *attain* rate control. \n+ **AFib *with*** a ***slow* ventricular response** is present — IF the *average* rate is *less* than 50-60/minute \\(**Tracing C**\\). New-onset *slow* AFib is unusual — and should suggest a different set of diagnostic consideration \\(*rate-slowing drugs; hypothyroidism; ischemia/infarction; sick sinus*\\). \n\n \n\n***Clinical* PEARL:** When AFib is rapid — the irregularity in the rhythm may be subtle. As a result — *rapid* AFib may sometimes *simulate* PSVT. We see this toward the end of **Tracing A** \\(*in* Fig. 02.14-1\\).\n\n+ **Calipers** may be needed to verify that the rhythm is in fact irregular *throughout* the tracing. \n\n \n\n**02.15 – *Advanced *POINT: *Very* Fast AFib — *Think WPW\\!***\n\nThe usual rate range for ***“rapid” *A Fib** is ***between* ~110-180/minute**. IF ever the rate of A Fib is significantly *above* this \\(ie, *\u003e200-220/minute*\\) — the patient probably has an AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\) that is *bypassing *the AV node \\(ie, **WPW** = *Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome*\\).\n\n+ The intrinsic *refractory period* of the normal AV node generally does *not* allow conduction of more than 200-220 impulses per minute. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.15-1:** The QRS complex is wide. **AFib** is diagnosed by the *irregular* irregularity in the *absence* of P waves. The rate attains 250-300/minute in parts of the tracing. This is virtually diagnostic of **WPW** \\(*See Section 05.49*\\).\n\n**02.16 – *Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia***\n\nAFib should be distinguished from ***MAT ***\\(*Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia*\\)** ***—* in which the rhythm is also *irregularly* irregular, but in which *definite* P waves *are* present \\(*arrows in ***Figure 02.16-1**\\). Note that P wave morphology changes from *beat-to-beat* with MAT *—* which is what distinguishes MAT from wandering atrial pacemaker \\(*See *Figure 02.10-1\\). The name *tells all* about its ECG appearance: ***M****ultiple* **A**trial foci \\(*P waves*\\) are seen at a *fast* rate \\(ie, ***T****achycardia*\\).\n\n+ In our experience *—* **MAT** is the 2nd most commonly overlooked arrhythmia diagnosis \\(*next to AFlutter*\\). MAT is ***easy to* overlook** *—* because the overwhelming majority of sustained *irregular* SVT rhythms are AFib. \n+ Clinically *—* MAT is most often seen in patients who have either: **i\\)** *pulmonary* disease or **ii\\)** severe *multisystem* problems \\(*sepsis, shock, acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities*, etc.\\). The *best* way to *avoid* overlooking MAT is to ***think of this diagnosis*** whenever you see an irregularly *irregular* rhythm in either of the above settings.  \n+ **12 leads** are *better* than one. You may *not* always see different P wave shapes in a single monitoring lead. Get a **12-lead ECG** and look for atrial activity in *all* 12 leads. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.16-1:** MAT is distinguished from AFib by the presence of multiple *different-looking* P waves. The importance of recognizing MAT is its different treatment \\(*Section 02.17*\\).\n\n**02.17 – FIGURE 02.17-1: *Why is this Not AFib?***\n\nWhy is the *irregularly* rhythm seen in Figure 02.17-1 *not* AFib? HINT: This ECG was obtained from a patient with COPD \\(*Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease*\\).\n\n+ Can you see atrial activity in *some* of the 12 leads? If so — in *which* ones? \n+ Clinically — Why is it important to make the correct rhythm diagnosis? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.17-1:** What is the rhythm on this 12-lead ECG? *What else* do you see on this tracing that supports your rhythm diagnosis? 152\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.17-1:** The rhythm is *irregularly* irregular. The QRS complex is narrow. The rhythm in Fig. 02.17-1 is *not* AFib — because P waves *are* clearly seen in lead II. P waves are also seen in leads III and aVF — but *not* in other leads.\n\n+ **P wave morphology** in lead II ***changes*** from beat to beat. This observation *plus* knowing this patient has **COPD** helps to *solidify* the ECG rhythm diagnosis of **MAT**. \n+ *Additional* support of the diagnosis of MAT is forthcoming from recognition of several **ECG findings** that suggest ***significant* pulmonary disease**. These include: **i\\)** Schamroth’s sign \\(*very low QRST amplitude in lead I*\\); **ii\\)** tall *pointed* P waves in lead II among the P wave morphologies seen; and **iii\\)** persistence of precordial S waves through to V5,V6 \\(*See Section 08.33*\\). \n+ The clinical importance of recognizing MAT \\(*and distinguishing it from AFib*\\) — is that treatment of these two entities is different\\!*** Treatment of* MAT** — is *best* directed at correcting the *underlying* cause \\(*optimizing oxygenation in this case*\\). In contrast — Treatment of **AFib** focuses on rate control; converting the rhythm; and anticoagulation considerations. \n\n \n\n***KEY Clinical* Point:** Rather than a discrete entity — think of MAT as ***part*** of a **spectrum**. At one end — is sinus rhythm with *occasional* PACs \\(**Tracing B** in Figure 02.11-1\\). At the other — is MAT in which P wave morphology \\(*and the PR interval*\\) change from *beat-to-beat*. Along the way you may see sinus rhythm with *multiple* PACs \\(*but not quite enough beat-to-beat change to diagnose “MAT”*\\).\n\n+ Clinically — implications of the various arrhythmias that may be seen *throughout* this spectrum are similar. These are to diagnose and treat the underlying disorder as first priority \\(*usually hypoxemia from pulmonary disease; electrolyte or acid-base disturbance; other metabolic problems*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.18 – *Atrial Flutter***\n\nAFlutter \\(*Atrial Flutter*\\) — is characterized by a special pattern of *regular* atrial activity that in adults *almost *always \\(*and almost magically*\\) occurs at a rate of **300/minute** \\(*250-350/minute = usual range*\\). Atrial flutter typically manifests a ***sawtooth*** appearance that is usually best seen in the *inferior* leads — although at times, flutter waves may be subtle and only seen in a few leads \\(Figure 02.18-1\\).\n\n+ The ***most* common** *ventricular* response to atrial flutter \\(*by far\\!*\\) is with **2:1 AV conduction**. As a result, the ventricular rate with ***untreated*** atrial flutter will usually be *close* to **150/minute** \\(ie, *~300 ÷ 2*\\). **NOTE:** The atrial rate *may slower* IF antiarrhythmic drugs are used. \n+ Less commonly with AFlutter there is **4:1** AV conduction \\(*ventricular rate ~75/minute*\\) — or a ***variable*** \\(= *irregular*\\)** ventricular response**. \n+ ***Odd *ratios** \\(ie, *1:1, 3:1, 5:1*\\) are possible but ***extremely* uncommon** \\(*unless the patient has WPW *or* is already on antiarrhythmic drugs*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.18-1:** Atrial Flutter with 2:1 AV conduction \\(**Tracing A**\\). Note how much easier it is to identify AFlutter when the AV conduction ratio is slower \\(*as it is with 4:1 AV conduction in* **Tracing B**\\). Tracing B shows the effect that a ***vagal* maneuver** might have \\(*See Sections 02.26, 02.27*\\).\n\n**02.19 – FIGURE 02.19-1: *Easy to Overlook AFlutter …***\n\nIn our experience — **AFlutter** is by far the **most commonly *overlooked* rhythm diagnosis**. It is *easy* to overlook — because flutter waves may *not* always be evident in the lead you are monitoring.\n\n+ ***Always* suspect AFlutter** \\(*until proven otherwise*\\) — whenever there is a ***regular* SVT at ~150/minute** *without* clear sign of normal atrial activity. This is precisely what is seen in \\(**Figure 02.19-1**\\). The patient was stable. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.19-1:** There is a ***regular* SVT** \\(*narrow QRS rhythm*\\) at a rate of **~150/minute**. Normal atrial activity is *not* seen \\(*no clear upright P wave is evident in this lead II monitoring lead*\\). IF the patient is stable — Look for atrial activity in *other* leads\\!\n\nIF the patient is *hemodynamically* stable and tolerating the tachycardia — then a **look** at ***additional* leads** may facilitate diagnosis:\n\n+ A **12-lead ECG** is obtained \\(**Figure 02.19-2**\\). Note how this helps to verify our suspicion of *non-sinus* atrial activity \\(*red and blue arrows*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.19-2:** 12-lead ECG obtained on the patient whose initial rhythm was shown in Figure 02.19-1.\n\n**02.20 – *How NOT to Overlook AFlutter* \\(Figure 02.19-1\\)**\n\nWe were *not* initially certain of the rhythm diagnosis in **Figure 02.19-1**. We assessed this rhythm as a **regular *narrow-complex* tachycardia** \\(ie, *a regular SVT*\\) at a rate of **~150/minute** *without* sinus P waves.\n\n+ We saw one \\(*if not two*\\) negative deflections *within* each R-R interval in Figure 02.19-1 suggesting atrial activity. \n+ Remembering the statement: **“*AFlutter* until *proven otherwise*”** for *any* regular SVT at ~150/minute *without* sinus P waves — We *suspected* this diagnosis \\(*but were not certain*\\). \n+ Since the patient was *hemodynamically* stable \\(*as they usually will be with SVT rhythms*\\) — We obtained a **12-lead ECG** \\(Figure 02.19-2\\). The 12-lead *confirmed* that the QRS was *truly* narrow in *all* leads. It also suggested *regularly* occurring atrial activity at *rapid* rate in *many* leads \\(*red and blue arrows in* Figure 02.19-2\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** There is *no* indication of atrial activity *during* the *regular* SVT in several leads in Fig. 02.19-2 \\(*leads I, aVL,V6*\\). Flutter waves are *not* always seen in all leads. That said — leads with the ***arrows*** clearly demonstrate that the deflections we see are “real”.\n\n+ **PEARL — *Using* Calipers:** Use of ***calipers*** greatly facilitates the diagnostic process. There is no easier way to identify if baseline deflections are regularly occurring or not. Using calipers enables us to diagnose AFlutter simply from the 12-lead tracing shown in Figure 02.19-2 \\(*arrows*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.21 – FIGURE 02.21-1: *Vagal Maneuvers to Confirm AFlutter***\n\n*Confirmation* of AFlutter as the rhythm diagnosis for Figure 02.19-1 was forthcoming following application of a ***vagal* maneuver** \\(Figure 02.21-1\\).\n\n+ Note *transient* slowing of the ventricular response after the *large* arrow \\(*vagal maneuver*\\) — revealing **regular *atrial* activity** at **~300/minute**. The *only* rhythm that does this is atrial flutter. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Whether or not a vagal maneuver was truly needed in this case to confirm AFlutter vs *sufficient* comfort in this diagnosis from simply reviewing the 12-lead ECG in Figure 02.19-2 — would depend on the experience level, expertise and practice preferences of the treating clinician. Clinically — We would be *less* inclined to use IV adenosine once we *know* the rhythm is AFlutter \\(*since adenosine won’t convert AFlutter*\\) — and *more* inclined to treat with an AV nodal blocking agent \\(*diltiazem, beta-blocker*\\) while contemplating more definitive measures. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.21-1:** A ***vagal* maneuver** is applied \\(*large arrow*\\) to the rhythm initially shown in Figure 02.19-1. The vagal maneuver temporarily *slows* AV nodal conduction — thereby revealing *underlying* atrial activity at 300/minute \\(*smaller red arrows*\\). The *only* rhythm that does this is **AFlutter**.\n\n**02.22 – FIGURE 02.22-1: *Some KEY Aspects about AFlutter***\n\nGiven the elusiveness of AFlutter — We highlight some *advanced* special characteristics of this rhythm by the 4 tracings shown in **Figure 02.22-1**:\n\n+ How would you interpret each tracing in this Figure? \n+ *Which concept* regarding recognition/differential diagnosis of AFlutter do you think is illustrated by each example? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.22-1 \\(***Tracings A,B,C,D***\\):** How does each tracing relate to diagnosis *or* misdiagnosis of AFlutter?\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing A \\(***in* Figure 02.22-1**\\):**\n\n+ As noted in Section 02.18 — there may be a ***variable*** ventricular response to AFlutter \\(**Tracing A**\\). Despite *irregular* irregularity that would otherwise suggest AFib — the diagnosis of **AFlutter** is secure in Tracing A from the **precisely regular *sawtooth* pattern** of atrial activity seen here at a rate just over 300/minute. \n\n \n\n**02.23 – TRACING B: *AFlutter with 3:1 AV Conduction***\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.23-1**: What is *unusual* about the example of AFlutter shown in Tracing B?\n\n**Answer to Tracing B:**\n\n+ The rhythm in** Tracing B** \\(*initially seen as B in *Fig. 02.22-1\\) — is another example of **AFlutter**, this time with **3:1 AV conduction**. As noted in Section 02.18 — *odd* conduction ratios are *extremely* uncommon in AFlutter. That said — they *can* be seen on occasion. The diagnosis of **AFlutter** is secure in Tracing B from recognition of *precisely* regular atrial activity \\(*arrows*\\) at a rate of ~300/minute. *Nothing else does this*. We count 3 flutter waves within each R-R interval. \n\n \n\n**02.24 – TRACING C: *AFib-Flutter ***\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.24-1**: Is the rhythm in Tracing C AFib or AFlutter?\n\n**Answer to Tracing C:**\n\n+ The rhythm in** Tracing C** \\(*initially seen as C in *Fig. 02.22-1\\) — shows a slow, *irregularly* irregular rhythm with narrow QRS and underlying atrial activity. Initially the rhythm looks like AFlutter — but toward the end of the tracing baseline undulations look more like AFib. Although often referred to as ***“AFib-Flutter”*** — the important clinical point is that the rhythm behaves as AFib. Although technically this rhythm is *best* classified as *very slow* AFib — We would *also* accept interpretation as *AFib-Flutter* as a *descriptive* term that perhaps most accurately conveys the ECG picture in Tracing C. \n\n \n\n**02.25 – TRACING D: *AFlutter *vs* Artifact***\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.25-1**: Is atrial activity in Tracing D real? What do you *suspect* the rhythm is? How might you confirm this?\n\n**Answer to Tracing D:**\n\n+ The rhythm in** Tracing D** \\(*initially seen as D in *Fig. 02.22-1\\) — is *not* AFlutter. Instead — the numerous small undulations that populate the baseline represent **artifact**. We *know* the rhythm in **Figure 02.25-1** is not AFlutter because:** i\\)** We can see regular underlying P waves \\(*arrows in *Figure 02.25-2\\); **ii\\)** These P waves are *unaffected* by the baseline artifact: **iii\\)** the artifact undulations are too fast and irregular to be AFlutter; and **iv\\)** We looked at the patient \\(*who manifested an obvious* ***resting* tremor**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.25-2:*** Arrows* highlight sinus P waves in Tracing D. These sinus P waves are superimposed on baseline artifactual undulations.\n\n**02.26 – Use of *VAGAL* Maneuvers \\(*Carotid Massage, Valsalva*\\)**\n\nVagal maneuvers are commonly used to facilitate ECG diagnosis — *and/or* to treat certain cardiac arrhythmias. Vagal maneuvers work by producing a *transient* increase in ***parasympathetic* tone** — thus temporarily *slowing* conduction through the AV node. This was seen in Figure **Figure 02.21-1** — in which the vagal maneuver facilitated ECG diagnosis of AFlutter.\n\n+ ***C****arotid ****S****inus* **M**assage **\\(CSM**\\) — Always perform under *constant* ECG monitoring. Use the *right* carotid first. *Never* press on both carotids at the same time. Remember that the carotid sinus is located *high* in the neck at the angle of the jaw\\! \\(*green arrow in ***Figure 02.26-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.26-1:** Carotid massage \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Additional* points** to consider about **CSM** include:\n\n+ Warn patient that the maneuver will be uncomfortable \\(*as very firm pressure is needed for success*\\). Apply enough pressure to *indent* a tennis ball. \n+ Rub for *no more *than 3-5 seconds at a time. \n+ IF no response — may repeat CSM on the *left* side. \n+ *Don't* do CSM if patient has a carotid bruit \\(*as you may dislodge a carotid plaque*\\). \n+ ***Always* monitor** the patient on **ECG**\\! Mark the time you *start* carotid massage — and the time you stop \\(*which provides hard copy of what occurred*\\). ECG changes with CSM may be quite subtle \\(*which is another reason to get a hard copy rhythm strip recording during the time CSM is done*\\). \n\n \n\n***Valsalva ****— *Have patient *supine*. Forcibly exhale \\(*bear down*\\) against a closed glottis \\(*as if trying to go to the bathroom*\\) for up to 15 seconds at a time. If properly performed — may be even *more* effective than CSM\\!\n\n**02.27 – FIGURE 02.27-1: *Clinical Response to Vagal Maneuvers *** \n\nKnow the response you are looking for *before* beginning \\(**Figure 02.27-1**\\).\n\n+ At times *— reapplication* of a vagal maneuver *after* administration of an AV nodal blocking drug \\(ie, *diltiazem; a β–blocker*\\) may work, whereas it didn’t work *before* the drug was given. \n+ A *similar* response as is described in Figure 02.27-1 would be expected with ***“chemical”* valsalva** \\(*from diagnostic/therapeutic use of Adenosine*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.27-1:*** What to expect* from CSM/Valsalva.\n\n**02.28 – *Using *ADENOSINE = *“Chemical” Valsava *** \n\nAdenosine is an extremely useful drug for treatment of SVT. It will *rapidly* convert *most* PSVT — and it usually produces transient *slowing* of other SVT rhythms which may be diagnostic \\(*as it is in* **Figure 02.28-1**\\).\n\n+ **Adenosine** may also convert 5-10% of VT \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) rhythms — especially outflow track VT that is prone to develop in younger adults without underlying heart disease. For this reason — *current* ACLS Guidelines recommend trial of Adenosine *early* in the course of treating *either* narrow or wide tachycardias of *uncertain* etiology. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.28-1:** Administration of **Adenosine** \\(*“chemical” valsalva*\\) — was diagnostic of SVT etiology in this patient \\(*arrows reveal underlying AFlutter at ~300/minute*\\). But in so doing — a period of *over* 10 seconds ensued *without* a QRS complex. *Marked* bradycardia like this is *not uncommon* following Adenosine. Bradycardia almost always resolves *within* 30-60 seconds \\(*due to the drug’s ultra-short half-life*\\). Other *transient* side effects of Adenosine may include chest pressure; flushing; bronchospasm; metallic taste; a feeling of “impending doom”. \\(*Be sure to tell the patient these effects are short-lived\\!*\\).\n\n**NOTE:** Fortunately — Using Adenosine *early* in the treatment of a *regular* WCT \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\) of *uncertain* etiology is *unlikely* to be harmful \\(*given the ultra-short half-life of the drug*\\). The “good news” — is that doing so may convert *many* SVT rhythms — it will be *diagnostic* in others — and it may even convert a small percentage of VT rhythms.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Adenosine is *unlikely* to work for VT with *wide* QRS in a patient with *ischemic* heart disease. As a result — we generally favor omitting it from the treatment protocol of such patients. \n+ Be aware that conversion of a *regular* WCT to sinus rhythm following use of Adenosine does *not* prove a *supraventricular* etiology \\(*since the drug may convert a small percentage of VT rhythms*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.29 – PSVT/AVNRT ** \n\nPSVT \\(*Paroxysmal SupraVentricular Tachycardia*\\) — is a regular *supraventricular* tachycardia that most often occurs at a rate *between* 150-to-240/minute \\(**Figure 02.29-1**\\). Atrial activity is usually *not* evident — although subtle notching or a negative deflection \\(*representing retrograde atrial activity*\\) may sometimes be seen at the tail end of the QRS.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.29-1:** PSVT \\(*regular SVT without sinus P waves at ~200/minute*\\). Rate is calculated by the *every-other-beat* method \\(*See Section 02.31*\\).\n\nMechanistically — **PSVT** is a ***reentry* tachycardia** that involves at least some portion of the AV node \\(Figure 02.29-2\\). This accounts for the *other* name for this rhythm = **AVNRT** \\(***AV N****odal ****R****eentry ****T****achycardia*\\).\n\n+ PSVT is often initiated by a PAC \\(*which arrives early at the AV Node *— *at a time when conditions are “just right” to allow the reentry circuit to be set up*\\). Once set up — the impulse *continues* to circulate *within *the AV Node \\(Figure 02-29-2\\) — *until* the reentry pathway is either interrupted \\(ie, *by AV nodal blocking drugs *or* a vagal maneuver*\\) — or until it stops *spontaneously.* \n+ Of note, each time the impulse circulates around the AV Node — it conducts a QRS *down* to the ventricles and also conducts *retrograde* back up to the atria \\(Fig. 02.29-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.29-2:** PSVT. *Schematic* illustration of *reentry* involving a portion of the AV Node. Each time the impulse circulates around the AV node — it conducts a QRS *down* to the ventricles and also conducts *retrograde* back up to the atria.\n\n**02.30 – FIGURE 02.30-1: *Retrograde Conduction with PSVT *** \n\nMost of the time, atrial activity will *not* be seen *during* PSVT — because the retrograde P wave will be *hidden* within the *simultaneously* occurring QRS complex.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* On occasion — you *will* see notching in the *terminal* portion of the QRS complex *during* PSVT \\(**Figure 02.30-1**\\). When present — this *retrograde* atrial activity indicates a ***reentry* mechanism** is operative as the mechanism of the SVT. Clinically — *reentry* SVT rhythms are more likely to respond to vagal maneuvers *and/or* use of Adenosine. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Confirmation that notching in the *terminal* portion of the QRS complex truly represents *retrograde* atrial activity from a *reentry* SVT — can be forthcoming by obtaining a post-conversion 12-lead ECG. Once sinus rhythm has resumed — this notching in the terminal portion of the QRS should *no longer* be seen. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.30-1:** PSVT. *Subtle* notching is seen in the *terminal* portion of the QRS in several \\(*but not all*\\) leads \\(*arrows*\\). Identification of such retrograde atrial activity during a regular SVT rhythm indicates a ***reentry* mechanism** is operative.\n\n**02.31 –* The “Every-other-Beat” *Method \\(*for fast rates*\\)**\n\nAccurate determination of heart rate is essential for assessment of the various **SVTs** \\(*SupraVentricular Tachycardias*\\). When the rhythm is regular and the rate is *fast* — calculating rate is most easily accomplished using the ***\"Every-other-Beat\" *Method \\(**Figure 02.31-1**\\):**\n\n+ The R-R interval of *every-other-beat* for the PSVT rhythm in **Figure 02.31-1** is precisely 3 *large* boxes in duration. \n+ Therefore — ***half* the rate** will be **100/minute** \\(*300 divided by 3*\\). \n+ This means that the *actual* rate in Figure 02.31-1 must be *twice* this amount \\(= *100/minute X 2* = **200/minute**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.31-1:** PSVT \\(*previously shown in *Figure 02.29-1\\). Heart rate is estimated by the ***every-other-beat* method**. Since the R-R interval of *every-other-beat* is 3 large boxes in duration — *half* the rate = 100/minute \\(*300/3*\\). The *actual* rate is therefore *twice* this amount = 200/minute.\n\n**02.32 –* Junctional* Rhythms**\n\nJunctional \\(or *AV Nodal*\\) rhythms — are regular *supraventricular* rhythms in which atrial activity reflects an AV Nodal site of origin \\(**Figure 02.32-1**\\). As opposed to NSR \\(*Normal Sinus Rhythm*\\) — in which conduction begins in the **SA Node** and travels downward \\(*left panel in *Figure 02.32-1\\) — electrical activity *begins* in the **AV Node** with junctional beats or rhythm \\(*right panel*\\) — and is conducted *backward *\\(ie, *retrograde*\\) or *away* from Lead II. As a result, when a **P wave** is seen in **lead II** with junctional beats or junctional rhythm — it will be ***negative*** \\(*since electrical activity is traveling away from standard lead II in its path back to the atria*\\).\n\n\n\n**Fig. 02.32-1:** Anatomic site of origin for ***sinus* rhythm** \\(*left*\\) vs AV Nodal beats or **AV Nodal** \\(*junctional*\\) **rhythm** \\(*right*\\). As shown in the inserts — the P wave in lead II will be *upright* with sinus rhythm \\(*left insert*\\) but *negative* when a P wave is seen with junctional rhythm \\(*right insert*\\).\n\n**02.33 –* Junctional* Rhythms: *P Wave Appearance in Lead II***\n\nThe 3 possible scenarios for P wave appearance with junctional rhythms is best illustrated by **laddergram** \\(Figure 02.33-1\\). *Relative* speed of conduction backward \\(*to depolarize the atria*\\) — compared to *forward* speed of conduction \\(*to depolarize the ventricles*\\) will determine IF the **P wave** in **lead II** is:\n\n+ ***Negative* before** the QRS \\(**Panel B** *of* Figure 02.33-1\\) — as would occur if it takes *less* time to conduct back to atria than forward to ventricles. \n+ ***Negative* after** the QRS \\(**Panel D**\\) — as would occur if it takes *more* time to conduct back to atria. \n+ ***Absent* completely** — as would occur IF it takes approximately *equal* time to conduct back to atria as down to ventricles \\(*such that the retrograde P wave is hidden within the QRS — as seen in* **Panel C**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Fig. 02.33-1:** Laddergram of the 3 possibilities for P wave appearance in lead II with junctional beats or junctional rhythm. **Panel A** illustrates the **normal *forward* conduction** of ***sinus* rhythm**. The impulse originates in the SA Node *— *travels* through *the atria* — *slows down a bit as it passes *through* the AV Node* — *and is then transmitted *down* through the conduction system to the ventricles. NOTE: With ***junctional* beats** \\(*or junctional rhythm*\\) — the impulse originates from the **AV Node**. It then travels back \\(*retrograde*\\) to the atria and *down* to the ventricles. As a result *— *the **P wave** in **lead II** may be negative appearing either *before* \\(**Panel B**\\) or *after* \\(**Panel D**\\) the QRS – or – *no* P wave at all may be seen \\(**Panel C**\\). Clinically — Situation C is *most* common, whereas it is rare to see a P wave after the QRS \\(*situation D*\\).\n\n**02.34 –* Junctional* Rhythms: *Escape vs Accelerated***\n\nThere are 3 basic “types” of *junctional* rhythms *— *with the type determined by the ***rate*** of the rhythm \\(**Figure 02.34-1**\\):\n\n+ **AV Nodal *Escape* Rhythm** — when the junctional rate in an *adult* is between **40-60**/**minute** \\(*See ***Rhythm X*** in *Figure 02.34-1\\). An AV Nodal *“escape”* rhythm arises because the SA Node is either *delayed* or *fails* in its pacemaking function NOTE: — *This is not necessarily a pathologic rhythm\\!* \n+ ***Accelerated* Junctional Rhythm** — when the junctional rate speeds up to between 61-99/minute \\(**Tracing Y**\\) — at which point it *takes over* the pacemaking function from the SA Node. \n+ **Junctional *Tachycardia ***— when the rate *exceeds *100/minute \\(**Tracing Z**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.34-1:** Junctional rhythms. **NOTE:** Although we show *no* P wave in X and a *negative* P wave \\(*before and after the QRS*\\) in Y, Z — it is *rate* that determines the “type” of rhythm.\n\n***Clinical* Notes: *Junctional* Rhythms ***— *The *KEY* to assessing the clinical significance of a junctional rhythm is appreciation of the setting in which it occurs:\n\n+ **Junctional* “escape”*** \\(*40-60/minute*\\) — may be seen on occasion in otherwise *healthy* young adults *without* clinical consequence. \n+ The same is true in **children** \\(*and adolescents*\\) — for whom the normal *escape* rate is a bit faster \\(*50-80/minute*\\). \n+ In contrast — ***accelerated *junctional rhythms** \\(*in which the AV Node speeds up*\\) — typically occur in a *limited* number of clinical situations \\(*acute MI; post-operative state; congenital heart disease; shock; digoxin toxicity*\\). Recognition should prompt concern. The rhythm usually resolves by treating the *underlying* condition. \n+ **PEARL:** — Regardless of the serum digoxin level — *Think ****Dig Toxicity*** until proven otherwise *whenever* you see an *accelerated* junctional rhythm \\(*albeit this is less common nowadays given current reduced use of digoxin*\\). \n+ Final Note: Clinical implications of ***accelerated*** vs ***junctional* tachycardia** are the same \\(*the only difference is whether the rate is over or under 100/minute*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.35 –* Low Atrial *vs* Junctional* Rhythm?**\n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* Technically *— *a rhythm with a *negative* P wave preceding each QRS complex with *fixed* PR interval could be coming from a ***low atrial* site** *instead of* from the AV Node \\(**Figure 02.35-1**\\):\n\n+ Beats originating from *either* the **AV Node** \\(*Point ****X**** in ***Panel A*** of* Fig. 02.35-1\\) or from a ***low atrial *site** \\(*Point ****Y**** in* **Panel B**\\) *— *will *both* be perceived as *moving away* from lead II as they conduct back to depolarize the atria. As a result *—* a *negative* P wave may precede the QRS complex in *either* case. \n+ Practically speaking *—* it does *not* matter whether a beat or rhythm is of junctional or low atrial origin, because clinical implications are *similar* in each case. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.35-1:** The presence of a *negative* P wave *before* the QRS may also be seen with ***low* atrial** *as well as* junctional beats or rhythm. Atrial depolarization moves *away* from lead II \\(*red arrows*\\) when impulse origin is from *either* the AV node \\(**X**\\) *—* or from a site *low* in the atria \\(**Y**\\).\n\n**02.36 – VENTRICULAR \\(*= wide QRS*\\) Rhythms**\n\nWith the exception of the chaotic variability of VFib \\(*Ventricular Fibrillation*\\) — the *sustained* ventricular rhythms are most often regular \\(*or at least fairly regular*\\) rhythms that originate from a site in the ventricles.\n\n+ The **QRS complex** is ***wide*** — because the *ventricular* origin of these rhythms is *outside* the conduction system. The QRS looks *very* different than sinus beats. \n+ Ventricular rhythms may arise *either* as ***“escape”*** rhythms \\(*if supraventricular pacemakers fail*\\) — or as ***usurping* rhythms** \\(*when the ventricular focus accelerates and takes over the pacemaking function from the preexisting supraventricular pacemaker*\\). \n+ **P waves** with *ventricular* rhythms may be: **i\\)** *absent;* **ii\\)** *unrelated* to the QRS complex; — or **iii\\)** *retrograde*. \n\n \n\n**Types of *Ventricular* Rhythms: ***— *There are 3 basic “types” of *ventricular* rhythms *— *with the type determined by the ***rate*** of the rhythm:\n\n+ Slow IVR \\(*IdioVentricular Rhythm*\\) *— Section 02.37.* \n+ AIVR \\(*Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm*\\) *— Section 02.38.* \n+ VT \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) *— Section 02.39.* \n\n \n\n**02.37 – Slow *IdioVentricular* Escape Rhythm**\n\nThe term*** slow* IVR** is used to describe a regular \\(*or at least somewhat regular*\\) ventricular rhythm \\(*wide QRS; no conducting P waves*\\) — when the ventricular rate is ***between* 20-40/minute**. This is the usual rate range of an *intrinsic* ventricular escape focus. As a result — *slow* IVR is often referred to as an ***I****dio****V****entricular ****“escape” R****hythm* \\(Figure 02.37-1\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.37-1:*** Slow* IVR. The ventricular rhythm is regular at a rate of ~38/minute \\(*the R-R interval = 8 large boxes; 300/8 ~38/minute*\\). The QRS is wide. No P waves are seen.\n\n+ ***Clinical* Note:** — The occurrence of ***slow* IVR** is often an *ominous* finding that is commonly seen during the course of cardiac arrest. It may also arise as a ventricular *escape* rhythm in a patient with *complete* AV block. \n\n \n\n**02.38 – AIVR**\n\n**AIVR \\(*A****ccelerated* ***I****dio****V****entricular**** R****hythm***\\)** — is said to be present when the rate of the ventricular rhythm is ***more*** than **40/minute** — but ***does not exceed *110-120/minute** \\(Figure 02.38-1\\):\n\n+ **AIVR** \\(*also called “slow” VTach*\\) — is a relatively common *escape* rhythm that may be seen in patients with *acute* MI *and/or* during reperfusion therapy. It may also occur as a rhythm of cardiac arrest. No treatment is needed IF the patient is asymptomatic \\(*as this rhythm typically resolves on its own*\\). Do *not* give antiarrhythmic drugs \\(*the drugs may abolish the only escape rhythm the patient has*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.38-1:** AIVR. The ventricular rhythm is regular at a rate of 75/minute \\(*300/4*\\). This is *faster* than slow *idioventricular* escape — but *slower* than VT. Otherwise — the QRS is wide; there are *no* P waves.\n\n**02.39 – Ventricular Tachycardia**\n\n**VT \\(*V****entricular* ***T****achycardia***\\)** — is said to be present when the rate of the ventricular rhythm ***exceeds* 120-130/minute** \\(Figure 02.39-1\\):\n\n+ By definition — **VT** is *always* a ***“usurping”* rhythm**, in that the ventricular focus accelerates and *takes over* pacemaking from the preexisting supraventricular pacemaker. Prompt \\(*if not immediate*\\) treatment is essential. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.39-1:** VT. The ventricular rhythm is regular at a rate of ~150/minute \\(*300/2*\\). The QRS is wide; *No* P waves.\n\n**NOTE: ***— *There exists a ***“gray zone”*** — in which the ventricular rhythm occurs at a rate ***between* 110-to130/minute**. This falls *in between* the rate range for *“fast”* VT \\(*Section 02.39*\\) and the rate range for *“slow”* VT \\(*Section 02.38*\\).\n\n**02.40 –* ESCAPE* Rhythms: *ECG Recognition***\n\nIF for *whatever* reason sinus \\(*or other atrial rhythm*\\) fails — an ***escape* rhythm** will hopefully arise from either: **i\\)** the AV Node; or **ii\\)** the Ventricles \\(**Figure 02.40-1**\\).\n\n+ The ***rate* range** for the various ***“escape” *pacemakers** is easy to remember — because it steps down *sequentially* from the *lower* limit of **60/minute** for sinus rhythm \\(Figure 02.40-1\\). ** ** \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.40-1:*** Escape* rhythms. ***AV Nodal* Escape** \\(*Rhythm* **A**\\) — is recognized by the presence of a *narrow* QRS rhythm; rate *between* 40-60/minute. ***Ventricular* Escape** \\(*Rhythm* **B**\\) — is recognized by the presence of a *wide* QRS rhythm; rate *between* 20-40/minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n**02.41 – PRACTICE TRACINGS: *What is the Rhythm?***\n\n\n\nInterpret the following 5 arrhythmias \\(*Sections 02.42-thru-02.46*\\). All rhythm strips are obtained from **Lead II**. The patient was *hemodynamically* stable in each case. *Our answers follow after each tracing.*\n\n+ **Hint** — Use the **P**’s/**Q**’s and **3R** *systematic *approach for interpreting each rhythm \\(*Section 02.1*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.42 – PRACTICE: *Tracing A***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.42-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.42-1:** Practice Tracing A.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing A:** The rhythm is slightly irregular, with a rate *between* ~55-65/minute. The QRS complex is *narrow* and is regularly preceded by an *upright* P wave with *constant* PR interval in this lead II monitoring lead. This is **sinus* bradycardia*** and ***arrhythmia*** \\(*Section 02.7*\\).\n\n+ Sinus arrhythmia is a common normal variant rhythm — especially when seen in otherwise healthy children or young adults. \n+ Sinus arrhythmia is not always benign. Together with sinus bradycardia — it may sometimes be the initial manifestation of SSS \\(*Sick Sinus Syndrome*\\). Therefore — *History is everything\\!* IF the rhythm in Figure 02.42-1 was obtained from an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic young adult — no further follow-up or treatment is indicated. \n\n \n\n**02.43 – PRACTICE: *Tracing B***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.43-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.43-1:** Practice Tracing B.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing B:** The rhythm is regular at 75/minute \\(*the R-R interval is 4 large boxes* and* 300 ÷ 4 =75/minute*\\). The QRS complex is narrow. It is *not* preceded by any P waves. Thus, this is an **AV *Nodal* Rhythm**, albeit one that is slightly ***accelerated*** over the ***usual* 40-60/minute** rate expected for junctional “escape” in an **adult** \\(*Sections 02.32-thru-02.34*\\).\n\n+ The fact that no P wave at all is seen in this lead II rhythm strip is abnormal. This means that the impulse is *not* originating from the SA node. \n+ It is important to know the ***age*** of this patient. The normal AV node escape rate in children is between 50-80/minute. On occasion — transient AV nodal escape may be seen in otherwise healthy children. Therefore — this tracing would *not* necessarily indicate any cardiac pathology IF it was obtained from an otherwise healthy child. \n+ Always consider the possible ***reasons*** why a patient may be in an **AV nodal rhythm** — *especially* when the escape rate is slightly accelerated \\(*as it would be if the rhythm in* Fig. 02.43-1 *was obtained from an adult*\\). If the patient is taking Digoxin — Digitalis toxicity is likely *regardless* of the serum digoxin level. *Other* clinical settings in which an ***accelerated* junctional rhythm** is likely to be seen include: acute ischemic heart disease — post-operative state — acutely ill patient — congenital heart disease. \n\n \n\n**02.44 – PRACTICE: *Tracing C***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.44-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.44-1:** Practice Tracing C.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing C:** The rhythm is rapid and *irregularly* irregular. There are no definite P waves. Although the QRS is wide — this is *not* VT. Instead, the *irregular* irregularity and lack of atrial activity define this rhythm as **AFib**, here with a ***rapid* ventricular response** \\(*Section 02.14*\\). QRS widening is presumably from *preexisting* bundle branch block.\n\n+ Note that there are several places in this tracing where it *almost* looks as if there may be P waves. This is admittedly deceptive. Instead of “P waves” — these are undulations in the baseline that are commonly seen with atrial fibrillation \\(*“fib” waves*\\). Gross irregular *irregularity* of the rhythm and *lack* of any repetitive P wave shape define this rhythm as AFib. ***Confirmation*** could be forthcoming by obtained a **12-lead ECG** with rhythm strip. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* We suspect this patient has LAHB \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\) — because of the markedly *negative* QRS in this lead II \\(*Section 07.13*\\). There may or may not also be underlying RBBB. A 12-lead ECG would be needed to know for sure. \n\n \n\n**02.45 – PRACTICE: *Tracing D***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.45-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.45-1:** Practice Tracing D.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing D:** The rhythm is rapid and regular. The QRS appears to be narrow. We estimate heart rate by the *every-other-beat* method \\(*Section 02.31*\\). The R–R interval of **every-***other***-beat** \\(ie, *half* the rate\\) is about 3 large boxes. This means that *half* the rate is ~100/minute \\(*300/3*\\). The ***actual* rate** is therefore *twice* this, or **~200/minute**. The rhythm is **PSVT** — since a rate of ~200/minute is *too fast* for *either* sinus tachycardia in an adult or *untreated* AFlutter \\(*See *List \\#2 — *Sections 02.52, 02.53*\\).\n\n+ Although children may manifest sinus tachycardia at rates *over* 200/minute — the *rapidity* of the rate in Fig. 02.45 virtually *excludes* sinus tachycardia in an adult. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* A useful formula to keep in mind is that ***maximal* heart rate = 220 — age**. This formula is used prior to treadmill testing to estimate what the “target heart rate” should be during the procedure \\(*the usual goal being to attain at least 85% of maximal predicted heart rate during exercise*\\). Thus — maximal *estimated* heart rate for a healthy **30-year old** would be 220 — 30 = **190/minute**. That said — clinical sinus tachycardia in an adult \\(*who is not performing maximal exercise*\\) rarely exceeds a rate of 160-170/minute. This is *not* to say that you will never see sinus tachycardia rates faster than this — but *only* to say the odds strongly favor an etiology *other than* sinus tachycardia for a *regular* SVT \u003e170/minute. \n\n \n\n**02.46 – PRACTICE: *Tracing E***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.46-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.46-1:** Practice Tracing E.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing E:** The rhythm is *irregularly* irregular. The R-R interval appears to vary *between* 2 and 3 large boxes. The QRS is narrow. Despite the irregularity — this is *not* AFib because P waves *are* present. P wave morphology *varies* from beat-to-beat. This is **MAT** \\(*Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia — Section 02.16*\\).\n\n+ It is important to distinguish MAT from AFib \\(*Section 02.17*\\). *Both rhythms are irregularly irregular*. The difference is that *no* P waves are seen on any of the leads of a 12-lead ECG with AFib. In contrast — *definite* P waves *are* seen with MAT. As opposed to wandering pacemaker, in which there is gradual transition from one P wave shape to another — with MAT, P wave variation is completely random and varies from one beat to-the-next \\(*as in* Fig. 02.46-1\\). \n+ The *KEY* in management of MAT is to treat the *underlying* disorder. Most often this is *either* pulmonary disease or a combination of *multiple* medical problems including sepsis, shock, acid-base disturbance, etc. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**02.47 – LIST \\#1: *Regular WCT***\n\n\n\n**NOTE:** — We have developed **6 *Essential* Lists** to facilitate recall of important aspects of 12-Lead/Arrhythmia interpretation. This is the first of our 6 Lists \\(*Section 00.7*\\).\n\nThe **1st priority** in evaluating *any* tachycardia is to ensure that the patient is ***hemodynamically* stable**. IF not — *immediately* cardiovert\\! If the patient is unstable, it *no longer matters* what the rhythm may be \\(ie, *VT or SVT with aberrant conduction*\\) — since the need for *immediate *synchronized cardioversion will be the same.\n\n+ But — IF the patient *is STABLE* hemodynamically — an attempt *can* be made to determine the etiology of the tachycardia *before* proceeding further. \n+ IF the **QRS** during tachycardia is ***WIDE*** — then by definition, the rhythm is a **WCT \\(*W****ide-****C****omplex ***T**achycardia**\\)**. *Consider the causes* = **LIST \\#1** \\(Figure 02.47-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.47-1:** Causes of a ***Regular* WCT**. *Always* assume the rhythm is VT *until* proven otherwise \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.48 – List \\#1: *KEY Points***\n\nOur reason for putting **VT** as the first 8 entities in LIST \\#1 is twofold: **i\\)** It is *by far* **the *most* common cause** of a regular \\(*or almost regular*\\) WCT in adults when sinus P waves are lacking; and **ii\\)** It is **the most *serious* cause\\! \\(**Figure 02.48-1**\\)**.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.48-1:** Regular *monomorphic* WCT rhythm *without* clear sign of atrial activity. The rate is ~170/minute. *Presume* VT until *proven* otherwise \\(*See text*\\).\n\nWe describe the **WCT rhythm** in Figure 02.48-1 as ***“monomorphic”*** — since QRS morphology *stays the same* during the tachycardia \\(vs *polymorphic VT such as Torsades, in which QRS morphology changes* — *Section 06.6*\\).\n\n+ The ***likelihood* that** a **WCT** *without* P waves \\(*as seen in* Figure 02.48-1\\) **is VT** goes up even more \\(*to at least 90%*\\) — IF **i\\)** the patient in question is ***older*** and **ii\\)** the patient has *underlying* **heart disease** \\(*prior MI, cardiomyopathy, angina, heart failure*\\). This is true *regardless* of whether the patient is alert — and *regardless* of what the BP might be *during* the tachycardia \\(*VT can be present even if systolic BP exceeds 180 mmHg*\\)\\! \n+ Availability of a ***prior* 12-lead ECG** during sinus rhythm may be invaluable for assessing the possibility of ***preexisting* BBB**. That said — the clinical reality is that you’ll often have to initiate treatment *before* knowing for certain what the WCT rhythm is … \n\n \n\n**02.49 – *Suggested *Approach to WCT/*Presumed* VT**\n\n*Optimal* management of WCT rhythms depends on the *type* of WCT. *Assume VT* until proven otherwise.\n\n+ As long as the patient *remains* stable — Trial of *medical* therapy is reasonable. Be ready to cardiovert IF at *any* time the patient *becomes* unstable. \n+ Get a **12-lead ECG *during* tachycardia \\(**Figure 02.49-1**\\)**. This will *confirm* that the QRS is *truly* wide — as well as looking for atrial activity in *other* leads. We have found use of **3 *Simple* Rules** \\(*involving QRS morphology *and* axis during tachycardia*\\) may facilitate diagnosis \\(*Section 02.50*\\). \n+ Consider *early* use of Adenosine \\(*usually not harmful given its short half-life; may convert SVT and 5-10% of VTs*\\). \n+ Consider antiarrhythmic \\(*Amiodarone; Procainamide*\\). \n+ Be ready to cardiovert if/as needed. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.49-1:** 12-lead ECG for the rhythm in Fig. 02.48-1. This 12-lead tracing *confirms* that the rhythm is VT \\(*See Section 02.50*\\).\n\n**02.50 – *Use of the 3 Simple Rules***\n\nWe can statistically increase the chance that a *regular* WCT rhythm is VT to *over* 90% by *applying* **3 *Simple* Rules** to the **12-lead ECG** obtained *during* tachycardia:\n\n+ **Rule \\#1** — Is there ***extreme* axis deviation?** The presence of mild or even moderate left or right axis does *not* assist in distinguishing between VT vs SVT. But when there is ***extreme* axis deviation** \\(*such that the QRS in either lead I or aVF is virtually entirely negative*\\) — then VT is almost certain\\! \n+ **Rule \\#2** — Is **Lead V6 *all*** \\(*or almost all*\\)** Negative?** IF so — then VT is *highly* likely. Use of this lead V6 criterion is *only* helpful if there is *no more* than a tiny r wave in V6. If the R in V6 is ≥3mm — this *doesn’t* rule in or out VT. \n+ **Rule \\#3** — Is the **QRS “Ugly”?** The “uglier” the QRS complex — the *more* likely the rhythm is VT. The reason for this is that *aberrant* conduction almost always manifests some variation of a conduction defect \\(*RBBB; LBBB; LAHB; LPHB — or some combination thereof*\\). In contrast — VT originates from *outside* the conduction system \\(*and is therefore more likely to be wider and far less organized = “uglier” in its conduction pattern*\\). \n\n \n\n***Applying* the 3 *Simple* Rules to Figure 02.49-1:** If told that the rhythm in Figure 02.49-1 was obtained from an *older* patient *with* underlying heart disease — We’d estimate a ***~90% likelihood*** of **VT** based on the finding of a *regular* WCT rhythm *without* sinus P waves \\(*Section 02.47*\\). Use of the 3 *Simple* Rules allows us to *increase* the ***likelihood*** of **VT** to ***almost* 100%**:\n\n+ There is *extreme* axis deviation in Figure 02.49-1 \\(*the QRS complex is completely negative in lead I of this tracing*\\). \n+ Lead V6 is *almost entirely* negative \\(*at most a tiny r wave is present*\\). \n+ The QRS in Fig. 02.49-1 is very wide \\(*almost 0.20 second*\\) and formless. We say it is ***“ugly”*** because QRS morphology does *not* resemble any form of BBB or hemiblock. \n\n \n\n**02.51 – FIGURE 02.51-1: *12 Leads are BETTER than One ***\n\nWe present the lead II rhythm strip in Figure 02.51-1 to emphasize how ***12 leads are better than One***. This rhythm strip was obtained from a patient who was *hemodynamically* stable and tolerating the tachycardia. BP = 120/80 mmHg at the time this tracing was recorded.\n\n+ As per the *red* arrow — the rhythm in Figure 02.51-1 was interpreted as sinus tachycardia? *Do you agree?* \n+ *How would you proceed?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.51-1:** Lead II rhythm strip obtained from a patient who was hemodynamically stable. *Is this sinus tachycardia?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.51-1:** There is a *regular* tachycardia at ~150/minute. Despite the *arrow* suggesting sinus P waves — we are *uncertain* about QRS width. Since the patient is *hemodynamically* stable — the ***KEY*** to **management** is to ***obtain*** a **12-lead ECG** \\(Figure 02.51-2\\).\n\n+ *Some* patients in *sustained* VT may *remain* alert and *hemodynamically* stable for *extended* periods of time \\(*sometimes for hours —*** ***or even longer*\\). Both *short* term and *long* term management will be far more effective IF we can determine with certainty the rhythm diagnosis. Obtaining a **12-lead ECG *during* tachycardia** will often allow us to do so \\(**Figure 02.51-2**\\): \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.51-2:** 12-lead ECG obtained *during* tachycardia. Does the *red arrow* in Figure 02.51-1 represent a sinus P wave or the *initial* part of the QRS complex? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Interpretation of Figure 02.51-2:** It should now be apparent that there are *no* P waves on this tracing. Instead — the red *vertical* timelines show the QRS to be *very* wide. What was initially perceived as a “P wave” in lead II \\(Figure 02.51-1\\) — is in fact the initial part of the QRS complex.\n\n+ By the **3 *Simple* Rules** — we can state with ***virtual* certainty** that the rhythm in Figure 02.51-2 is **VT\\!** This is because: **i\\)** there is *extreme* axis deviation \\(*almost entirely negative QRS in lead aVF*\\); **ii\\)** the QRS in lead V6 is *predominantly* negative; and **iii\\)** the QRS is actually *very* wide and “ugly” \\(*amorphous, and not resembling any pattern of BBB/hemiblock*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** 12 leads are *better* than one. IF at all uncertain about the etiology of a tachycardia and the patient is *hemodynamically* stable — ***Get a 12-lead ECG***. This will often clarify the clinical picture.\n\n+ VT may look like a *“narrow tachycardia”* if only a *single* monitoring lead is used. This is because part of the QRS complex may sometimes lie on the baseline. Getting a **12-lead *during* tachycardia** will confirm QRS duration. \n+ Some patients may remain alert and *hemodynamically* stable despite being in sustained VT for *extended* periods of time. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**02.52 – LIST \\#2: *Regular SVT***\n\n\n\nThe 2nd of our 6 Lists also relates to assessment of tachycardia. We again emphasize that IF the patient who is in tachycardia is unstable — *immediately* cardiovert\\!\n\n+ But — IF the patient *is STABLE* hemodynamically — an attempt *can* be made to determine the etiology of the tachycardia *before* proceeding further. \n+ IF the **QRS** during tachycardia is truly ***NARROW ***\\(*in all 12 leads*\\) — then by definition, the rhythm is an **SVT \\(*S****upra****V****entricular ***T**achycardia**\\)**. One of the 3 entities in **LIST \\#2** \\(Figure 02.52-1\\) is then likely to be the cause of ~90-95% of cases of a ***Regular *SVT**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.52-1:** Common causes of a ***Regular* SVT** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** It is theoretically possible for the QRS complex to be narrow despite *ventricular* origin of the arrhythmia. That is — VT \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) may on rare occasions originate from a site in the Bundle of His or in one of the bundle branches. That said, for practical purposes — IF the QRS is *truly* narrow in *all* 12 leads — the rhythm is supraventricular\\!\n\n**02.53 – The *Regular* SVT:** — ***Differential Diagnosis?***\n\nThe best way to illustrate practical utility of **LIST \\#2** is through clinical example \\(**Figure 02.53-1**\\):\n\n+ What is your ***differential* diagnosis** of the rhythm in Fig. 02.53-1? \n+ Clinically — *How would you proceed?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.53-1:** *Regular* SVT at ~200/minute *without* sign of atrial activity. The patient is stable. *What is the rhythm? *\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.53-1:** The rhythm is regular. The QRS is narrow. By the ***every-other-beat* method** \\(*Section 02.31*\\) — the R-R interval of *half* the rate is 3 *large* boxes. Therefore — *half* the rate in Fig. 02.53-1 = 300/3 = 100/minute. This means that the ***actual* rate** = 100 X 2 = **200/minute**.\n\n+ There is *no* clear sign of atrial activity in Fig. 02.53-1. While one *cannot* rule out the possibility that a P wave might be hidden within the ST segment — this is highly unlikely \\(*would require an extremely long PR interval*\\). \n+ The ***differential* diagnosis** for this *regular* SVT *without* P waves is essentially that shown in **LIST \\#2** \\(Figure 02.52-1\\). While there *are* other types of SVT rhythms \\(ie, *automatic atrial and junctional tachycardias*\\) — these are *far less common* than the 3 entities we include in List \\#2. **NOTE:** AFib is *not* a consideration in Figure 02.53-1 — because this rhythm is regular\\! \n+ To distinguish between the 3 entities on List \\#2 — We begin by *looking* at the rate of this *regular* SVT. **IF** the ***rate*** of a ***regular* SVT is \u003e160-170/minute** — then *both* sinus tachycardia and AFlutter become *far less* likely. While ***sinus* tachycardia** may attain rates of ≥200/minute in children — excessively fast rates are unusual in *nonexercising* adults. Therefore, the rate of ~200/minute in Fig. 02.53-1 effectively *rules out* sinus tachycardia in this case. \n+ **AFlutter** — most often conducts at a ventricular rate that is ***close* to 150/minute** \\(*usual range ~140-160/min*\\). That said — all bets are off regarding the rate range for flutter activity IF the patient is on one or more antiarrhythmic drugs \\(*which may slow the flutter rate*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** By the process of elimination — the *regular* SVT at 200/minute in Figure 02.53-1 is *almost certain *to be PSVT.\n\n+ On the other hand — IF the rate of this regular SVT would have been *closer* to 150/minute — then *each* of the 3 entities in List \\#2 would have to be considered. \n\n \n\n**02.54 – *Suggested* Treatment Approach for a *Regular* SVT**\n\n*Optimal* management of the *narrow* tachycardia depends on the *type* of SVT. The “good news” — is that *definitive* diagnosis is *not* essential for appropriate initial management. As long as the patient *remains* stable — there is time to consider the following:\n\n+ Get a **12-lead ECG *during* tachycardia**. Verify that the QRS is *truly* narrow in *all* leads. You may see sign of atrial activity in *other* leads \\(*as was evident in* Figure 02.19-2 *and in* Figure 02.30-1\\). \n+ **Fix** any ***“Fixables”*** you can \\(*low K\\+/Mg\\+\\+; acidosis; hypoxemia; hypovolemia; ischemia; heart failure, etc*.\\). \n+ *Consider* use of a ***vagal* maneuver** \\(*Section 02.26*\\). \n+ *Consider *empiric use of **Adenosine**. This drug is well tolerated by *most* patients. It will convert *most* PSVT — and, it usually produces *transient* slowing of *other* SVT rhythms which may be diagnostic \\(Figure 02.28-1\\). \n+ *Consider *other AV-blocking drugs \\(*β-blockers; diltiazem*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.55 – FIGURE 02.55-1: *Which SVT is present?***\n\nInterpret the rhythm for the 12-lead ECG and Lead II rhythm strip that appears in **Figure 02.55-1**:\n\n+ What is your *differential* diagnosis? \n+ What ***diagnostic* maneuver** might help in diagnosis? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.55-1:** *Regular* SVT at ~150/minute. *Diagnosis?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.55-1:** The rhythm is *regular* at a *ventricular* rate that is *close* to 150/minute \\(*the R-R interval is ~2 large boxes in duration *— *and 300/2 = 150/min*\\). The QRS complex is narrow \\(ie, *not more than half a large box*\\). Normal atrial activity is absent — since *upright* P waves are *not* seen in lead II. Instead, there is suggestion of atrial activity having a *negative* deflection in lead II \\(*as well as in other inferior leads*\\). There also appears to be a negative *notching* in the ST segment in each of the inferior leads. *Could this all represent atrial activity?*\n\n+ The answer is forthcoming with application of a ***vagal *maneuver**. The effect of **C**arotid **S**inus **M**assage \\(**CSM**\\) is illustrated in Figure 02.55-2. CSM was applied at the moment marked by the ***large* arrow**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.55-2:** Application of CSM \\(*large red arrow*\\) to the rhythm previously shown in Fig. 02.55-1.\n\n**Interpretation of Figure 02.55-2:** Application of carotid massage results in *reduction* in the AV conduction ratio from the 2:1 ratio previously seen in Figure 02.55-1. Note slight *lengthening* of the R-R interval following CSM — during which the typical ***sawtooth *pattern** of **AFlutter** can be readily recognized.\n\n+ The ***differential* diagnosis** of the rhythm in Figure 02.55-1 was that of the causes of a *Regular *SVT = **List \\#2** \\(*Section 02.52*\\). **CSM** in this case ***proves*** that the rhythm is **AFlutter**. \n\n \n\n***Clinical *NOTE:** After **lead II** — the ***next best* lead** to look for atrial activity in is **lead V1**. This is because *right-sided* lead V1 lies anatomically in close proximity to the atria. Note that a flutter *sawtooth* pattern is suggested in lead V1 on the 12-lead tracing in Figure 02.55-1.\n\n+ In retrospect — atrial activity *was* suggested in *several* leads in Fig. 02.55-1 \\(*II,III,aVF;aVR,aVL,V1,V2,V5*\\) — but it was *not* seen in all leads. CSM *confirmed* the diagnosis. \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** The best way to *avoid* overlooking the diagnosis of AFlutter — is to ***suspect* AFlutter** *until* proven otherwise *whenever* confronted with a *regular* SVT at a rate *close* to 150/minute but *without* definite sinus P waves \\(*Section 02.19*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**02.56 – *Premature* Beats**\n\n\n\n***Premature* Beats** — are QRS complexes that interrupt the underlying rhythm by occurring ***earlier*** than expected. They are **3 *basic* types** of ***early* beats** \\(Figure 02.56-1\\):\n\n+ **PACs \\(P**remature ***A****trial* **C**ontractions**\\)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from somewhere in the atria *other than* the SA node. As a result — the *early-occurring* P wave manifests a *different* shape \\(***beat \\#4**** in* **Fig. 02.56-1**\\). Most often the impulse is conducted with a *narrow* QRS complex that is *identical* in appearance to that of normal *sinus-conducted* beats. This is because once the premature atrial impulse arrives at the AV Node — its path of conduction through the AV Node and down to the ventricles is the *same* as it is for normally conducted sinus beats. \n+ **PJCs \\(P**remature ***J****unctional* **C**ontractions**\\)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from the AV Node. Most often the impulse is conducted with a *narrow* QRS that is similar \\(*if not identical*\\) to normal sinus-conducted beats. The P wave in lead II is *negative* or absent \\(***beat \\#6 ****in *Fig. 02.56-1; *See also Sections 02.32-thru-02.35*\\). Clinically — PJCs are much *less* common than PACs. \n+ **PVCs \\(P**remature ***V****entricular* **C**ontractions**\\)** — when the underlying rhythm is interrupted by an early beat arising from the *ventricles*. PVCs are *wide* and have a *very* different appearance from sinus beats. PVCs are *not* preceded by a premature P wave \\(***beat \\#8**** below*\\). The reason **PVCs** are ***wide*** — is that the premature impulse arises from a site within the ventricles *away* from the conduction system. It therefore takes *more time* for the premature impulse to be conducted through the ventricles. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.56-1:** Sinus rhythm with *premature* beats. These differ from *“escape beats”* that occur late \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** Although **beat \\#6** in Figure 02.56-1 is labeled as a “PJC” *—* it could be a *low atrial* PAC instead. There is *NO way* to know for certain \\(*Section 02.35*\\). Management is the same *—* so clinically, it really does *not* matter whether beat \\#6 is a PJC vs a PAC arising from a low atrial site \\(*PACs are much more common than PJCs*.\\)\n\n+ **PEARL** *—* ***Beyond-the-Core:*** Although the QRS complex of *junctional* beats is *usually* the same as the QRS of sinus-conducted beats — this is *not* always the case. At times — there may be *slight* variation in QRS morphology for *early-occurring* beats arising from the AV Node. This is because junctional beats may arise from *different* locations *within* the AV Node — which may result in a slightly different path of conduction. Thus, the QRS complex will still be narrow — but the R wave may be a little taller or shorter; or the S wave a little bigger or smaller. This is an *advanced* concept — but it may assist in evaluating occasional complex AV block tracings when it becomes important to determine IF certain beats are being conducted vs representing AV nodal escape. \n\n \n\n**02.57 – *ESCAPE* Beats: *Timing is Everything …***\n\nIt is important to distinguish between **early** \\(*premature*\\) **beats** vs ***late* beats**. Early beats \\(*PACs, PJCs, PVCs*\\) may be problematic — especially if they precipitate runs of tachycardia \\(**Tracing A** *in* Figure 02.57-1\\). In contrast — *late* beats often reflect an “escape” phenomenon which may be beneficial. Were it not for emergence of *ventricular* beats \\#5, 6 in **Tracing B** \\(*Fig. 02.57-1*\\) — the short pause \\(*between beats \\#4-5*\\) may have been much longer.\n\n+ *Unless* accelerated — the ***usual* rate** of ***ventricular* escape** is ***between* 20-40/minute** \\(*AIVR was covered in Section 02.38; Escape Rhythms in Section 02.40*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.57-1:** In **Tracing A** — an *early* beat \\(*PVC*\\) precipitates a run of VT after beat \\#3. In contrast —** beat \\#5** in **Tracing B** is *not* a “PVC”, because this beat is *not* premature. Instead — beat \\#5 in Tracing B occurs relatively *“late”*, and therefore reflects ***ventricular* escape** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.58 –* Narrow-Complex *Escape Beats**\n\nAs highlighted by Figure 02.57-1 — ***timing*** is the *key* parameter for distinguishing between *premature* vs *escape* beats. Consider the events in the 2 tracings shown below in **Figure 02.58-1**:\n\n+ What is **beat \\#5** in *both* Tracing A and Tracing B of Figure 02.58-1? \n+ Is the P wave that precedes beat \\#5 in Tracing B conducting? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.58-1:** *Narrow-complex* escape beats. Is the P wave that *just precedes* beat \\#5 in Tracing B conducting? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.58-1:** The *underlying* rhythm in Figure 02.58-1 is sinus — as determined by the presence of regular upright P waves preceding each of the first 4 beats with a constant \\(*and normal*\\) PR interval.\n\n+ **Beat \\#5** in *both* **Tracing A** and **Tracing B** of Figure 02.58-1 is **late**. As a result \\(*by definition*\\) — beat \\#5 can *not* be either a “PAC” or “PJC”, since it is *not* “premature”. \n+ Instead — beat \\#5 is an ***“escape”* beat**. The occurrence of beat \\#5 for each tracing in Figure 02.58-1 is a *good* thing\\! Sinus conduction *fails* after beat \\#4. If not for the escape beat \\(*beat \\#5*\\) — the pause in *each* case may have been *much* longer… \n\n \n\nFocusing first on** Tracing A** in **Figure 02.58-1**: The QRS complex of beat \\#5 is narrow. It is *not* preceded by any P wave. As a result — we *know* this escape beat *must be* arising from ***within*** the **conduction system**. Possibilities include the AV Node, Bundle of His, or from one of the major fascicles of the bundle branch system. Practically speaking — precise location of the escape site does *not* matter since initial clinical management will be the same *regardless* of the site of the escape beat.\n\n+ Sinus rhythm resumes in Tracing A after *slight* delay with **beat \\#6**. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* QRS morphology of escape beat \\#5 is similar but *not quite* identical to QRS morphology of normal sinus beats \\(*beat \\#5 is slightly taller than sinus beats *—* and it has a small narrow s wave that sinus beats don’t*\\). As alluded to in the *PEARL* in *Section 02.56* — recognition of this *slight* difference in QRS morphology for beat \\#5 \\(*compared to the QRS of normal sinus beats*\\) — provides support that *narrow-complex* beat \\#5 is arising from a supraventricular site *other than* the SA node. \n\n \n\n\n\nLooking next at** Tracing B** in **Figure 02.58-1**: The QRS complex of beat \\#5 is again narrow. This time beat \\#5 is preceded by a P wave — albeit the PR interval *preceding* the QRS of beat \\#5 in Tracing B is far ***too short* to conduct**.\n\n+ The P wave preceding beat \\#5 in Tracing B is *not* a “PAC” — because this P wave is not premature. \n+ We surmise instead that a brief ***sinus* pause** \\(*of 7 large boxes =1.4 seconds*\\) ensues after beat \\#4. The sinus node finally recovers — but *before* the P wave preceding beat \\#5 in Tracing B is able to conduct to the ventricles, an ***escape* beat** occurs. \n+ That the **QRS** complex of escape beat \\#5 in Tracing B is ***narrow*** tells us the escape focus *must be* arising from a site ***within* the ventricular conduction system**. Possibilities again include the AV Node, Bundle of His, or one of the major fascicles of the bundle branch system. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The R-R interval preceding escape beat \\#5 in Tracing B is 7 large boxes. This corresponds to an ***escape* rate** of **~43/minute** \\(300/7\\). Given that the *normal* AV nodal *escape* rate range in adults is *between* 40-to-60/minute — this 7-large-box long R-R interval is consistent with the rate of AV nodal escape. \n+ Normal sinus rhythm resumes in Tracing B after *slight* delay with **beat \\#6**. \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** The complexities of trying to determine IF the site of *narrow-complex* escape beats or rhythms originate from the AV Node, Bundle of His or fascicles of the bundle branch system are of *little* clinical importance\\! What counts — is that recognition of ***late* beats** with a ***narrow* QRS** \\(*as occurs in each tracing of Fig. 02.58-1*\\) — indicates an ***escape* site** from *somewhere* within the ***ventricular* conduction system**.\n\n**02.59 – PVC Definitions: *Repetitive Forms and Runs of VT ***\n\nClinically — the occurrence of ***repetitive* PVCs** \\(*2 or more in a row*\\) — is of much more concern than ***isolated* PVCs**. In addition to clinical assessment of the patient \\(ie, *for underlying heart disease; associated medical conditions; electrolyte imbalance; hypoxemia; etc*.\\) — one aims to assess the *relative* frequency of PVCs — QRS morphology \\(*uniform or multiform*\\) — coupling interval — *plus* the rate and duration of any runs \\(**Figure 02.59-1**\\):\n\n+ **Tracing A:** Following 3 *sinus* beats — an ***isolated* PVC** occurs \\(*beat \\#4*\\). Beats \\#7,8 — represent a ***ventricular* couplet**. Note that the *coupling* interval \\(*distance between beat \\#6 and beat \\#7*\\) and QRS morphology of this couplet are the *same* as was seen for the *isolated* PVC \\(*beat \\#4*\\). **Beat \\#10** — is another PVC. Since its shape is *different*, we say there are ***multiform* PVCs** in Tracing A. \n+ **Tracing B:** 3 *sinus* beats — then a ***ventricular* salvo** \\(*beats \\#4,5,6*\\). Since the ***definition*** of **“VT”** is ≥3 PVCs in a row — this is a 3-beat run of VT. **Beat \\#9** begins a ***longer* run** of **VT**. In fact — we have *no idea* of how long this run will last — since **Tracing B** in Figure 02.59-1 is cut off after beat \\#13. We describe beats \\#9-*thru*-13 as a **5-beat run** of ***monomorphic* VT** at a ***rate*** of **~150/minute**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.59-1:** Various forms of ventricular ectopy \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.60 –* Blocked* PACs/*Aberrant* Conduction**\n\nAlthough *most* premature *supraventricular* beats \\(*PACs or PJCs*\\) are conducted to the ventricles *normally* \\(ie, *with a narrow QRS*\\) — this is *not *always the case. Instead, PACs \\(*or PJCs*\\) may sometimes occur so early in the cycle as to be ***\"blocked\"*** \\(*non-conducted*\\) — because the conduction system is still in the **ARP** \\(*Absolute Refractory Period* = *2nd arrow in* **Figure 02.60-1**\\).\n\n+ At other times — *early* beats may occur during the **RRP** \\(*Relative Refractory Period*\\) — in which case ***aberrant* conduction** \\(*with a widened QRS*\\) occurs \\(*3rd arrow*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.60-1:** *Blocked* vs *aberrantly* conducted PACs.\n\n**NOTE:** Whether a PAC will be *blocked* vs conducted normally — or with *aberrancy* depends on *where* in the cycle the PAC occurs \\(**Figure 02.60-2**\\). A PAC occurring at point **X** in Fig. 02.60-2 will be blocked \\(*corresponding to the PAC notching the T wave of beat \\#5 in Fig. 02.60-1*\\). In contrast — a PAC that occurs *after* the RRP is over \\(*point ****Z**** in* Fig. 02.60-2\\) will be conducted normally \\(*corresponding to beat \\#4 in Fig. 02.60-1*\\). It is when the PAC occurs *within* the RRP that *aberrant* conduction is seen \\(*corresponding to point ****Y**** in* Fig. 02.60-2 = *beat \\#7 in Fig. 02.60-1*\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.60-2:** Whether a PAC \\(*or PJC*\\) will be blocked — conducted normally — or conducted with aberrancy — will depend on *where* in the cycle the beat occurs \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**PEARL:** The *best* way to diagnose PACs with ***aberrant* conduction** is when the abnormal beat is clearly *preceded* by a PAC \\(***beat \\#7**** in *Fig. 02.60-1\\). That said, IF ever in doubt as to whether a widened beat is an *aberrantly *conducted PAC vs a PVC — ***Assume**** a beat is**** “guilty”* \\(**ie, a **PVC\\)** until* proven *otherwise\\!\n\n+ NOTE:*** Blocked* PACs** may be *subtle* and a challenge to detect. They *will* be found IF looked for — they'll often be hiding \\(*notching*\\) the *preceding* T wave \\(*the PAC that occurs in the T wave of* ***beat \\#5**** in *Fig. 02.60-1 — and *the PAC marked by the* ***2nd arrow**** in* **Figure 02.60-3**\\). The *KEY* is to recognize *blocked* PACs \\(*and not misdiagnose the pause as a type of AV block*\\). Remember — **“The *commonest* cause of a pause is a *blocked* PAC”** \\(*and not AV block*\\)\\! \n\n \n\n***Aberrant* Conduction: *Use of QRS Morphology***\n\n*Aberrant* conduction is most likely to take the form of *some* type of bundle branch block/hemiblock pattern. RBBB aberration is the most common form — because the right bundle branch generally has a *longer* refractory period than other conduction fascicles. That said — *any* BBB/hemiblock pattern of aberrancy may be seen \\(*RBBB; LBBB; isolated LAHB or LPHB; RBBB/LAHB; or RBBB/LPHB*\\). Attention to **QRS *morphology*** of the *early-occurring* beat may therefore help to distinguish between *aberrant* conduction vs ventricular ectopy.\n\n+ The rSR’ with taller *right* rabbit ear for **beat \\#4** in **Figure 02.60-3** — is highly suggestive of ***aberrant* conduction**. \n+ The predominantly *negative* QRS deflection for **beat \\#7** in Figure 02.60-1 — is suggestive of **LAHB** \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\) **aberration**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.60-3:** The 1st PAC in this tracing is *aberrantly* conducted \\(*1st red arrow that just precedes beat \\#4*\\) — but the 2nd PAC is blocked \\(*2nd red arrow that notches the T wave of beat \\#7*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**02.61 – PRACTICE TRACINGS – II: *What is the Rhythm?***\n\n\n\nInterpret the following 5 arrhythmias \\(*Sections 02.62-thru-02.66*\\). All rhythm strips are obtained from **Lead II**. The patient was *hemodynamically* stable in each case. *Our answers follow after each tracing.*\n\n+ **Hint** — Use the **P**’s/**Q**’s and **3R** *systematic *approach for interpreting each rhythm \\(*Section 02.1*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.62 – PRACTICE: *Tracing F***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.62-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.62-1:** Practice Tracing F.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing F:** The rhythm is regular at 75/minute. The QRS complex is wide. P waves are present and *upright* in front of *each* QRS complex with a *fixed* PR interval. Thus *despite* QRS widening — this is a ***sinus *rhythm**.\n\n+ QRS widening is due to ***preexisting* BBB** \\(*Bundle Branch Block*\\). \n+ A 12-lead ECG would be needed to determine the type of BBB that is present. \n\n \n\n**02.63 – PRACTICE: *Tracing G***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.63-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.63-1:** Practice Tracing G.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing G:** The QRS is again wide and regular at 75/minute. However, *no P waves* are seen in this Lead II. Thus, the rhythm is *not* sinus. In the *absence* of P waves — QRS widening suggests a ***ventricular* site** of origin. Because the rate is *faster* than usual for a ventricular escape rhythm — this is **AIVR** \\(*Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm* — *Section 02.38*\\).\n\n+ The *clinical* setting is key for determining the approach to AIVR. This rhythm is often surprisingly benign when it occurs in the setting of *acute* MI in a *hemodynamically* stable patient. Its occurrence following PCI \\(*PerCutaneous Intervention*\\) — may herald *reperfusion* of the *infarct-related* artery. In contrast — prognostic implications are much poorer when AIVR is seen during the course of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \n\n \n\n**02.64 – PRACTICE: *Tracing H***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.64-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.64-1:** Practice Tracing H.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing H:** The first 3 beats show **NSR** \\(*Normal Sinus Rhythm*\\) at a rate of 70-75/minute. Beat \\#4 occurs early. It is wide, very *different* in morphology from *sinus-conducted* beats, and is* not* preceded by a premature P wave. **Beat \\#4** is a **PVC**. Since it is followed by another PVC \\(*beat \\#5*\\) — beats \\#4,5 form a ***ventricular *couplet**.\n\n+ Beats \\#6 and 7 are normal *sinus-conducted* beats. \n+ Beat \\#8 is early, narrow, of *similar* morphology to normal sinus beats — and is preceded by a different appearing *premature *P wave. Beat \\#8 is a **PAC** \\(*Section 02.56*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* There appears to be *slight* variation in the R-R interval of normal sinus beats in this tracing \\(ie, *the R-R interval between beats \\#1-2; 2-3; and 6-7 is slightly different*\\). It is difficult to determine IF this is due to underlying *sinus* arrhythmia vs some component of sinus node suppression from the *early-occuring* beats. Clinically — it does *not* really matter whether sinus arrhythmia is present or not, as the primary rhythm abnormality relates to the PAC/PVCs. \n\n \n\n**02.65 – PRACTICE: *Tracing I***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.65-1**. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.65-1:** Practice Tracing I.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing I:** The rhythm is rapid and regular at ~180/minute. The QRS appears to be *narrow*, which makes this a ***Regular *SVT**. It is impossible to determine IF the upright deflection between QRS complexes is a P wave, T wave, or both. The ***differential* diagnosis** is that of the **3 entities** contained in **List \\#2**. These are:** i\\)** Sinus Tachycardia; **ii\\)** Atrial Flutter; or **iii\\)** PSVT \\(*Section 02.52*\\). The rapid rate of ~180/minute favors **PSVT** as the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n\n+ Sinus Tachycardia *rarely* exceeds a rate of 160-170/minute in a *non-exercising* adult. This is *not* to say that you can never have Sinus Tach at a rate of 180/minute in an adult — but rather to *strongly* suggest you consider *other* diagnostic possibilities as far more likely. \n+ PSVT most commonly utilizes a ***reentry* mechanism** involving *some* portion of the AV Node to sustain the tachycardia. As a result — application of a ***vagal* maneuver** may be *both* diagnostic and therapeutic \\(*Sections 02.26, 02.27*\\). If vagal maneuvers are ineffective — administration of an AV nodal blocking drug \\(*Adenosine; Diltiazem; a β–Blocker*\\) stands an excellent chance of converting the rhythm. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Assuming the patient continues to tolerate the tachycardia — we favor ***obtaining*** a **12-lead ECG *during* tachycardia**. Doing so may provide additional clues to etiology — especially when compared to a post-conversion 12-lead tracing \\(ie, *the thin s-wave notch in the terminal portion of the QRS complex in Fig. 02.65-1 may represent retrograde atrial activity during this reentry tachycardia *— *similar to notching in the example of PSVT seen previously in* Figure 02.30-1\\). \n+ Finally — We note ***marked* ST depression** in Figure 02.65-1. That said — the amount of ST depression may be exaggerated by a rhythm strip. *Never* draw conclusions from ST segment deviations \\(*elevation or depression*\\) on a rhythm strip. Obtaining a **12-lead ECG** — and ***repeating*** the **12-lead** *after* the tachycardia resolves is the best way to assess likely clinical significance \\(*if any*\\) of ST depression seen during tachycardia. \n\n \n\n**02.66 – PRACTICE: *Tracing J***\n\nInterpret the lead II rhythm strip in **Figure 02.66-1**. The patient was hemodynamically stable during the *initial* portion of this rhythm strip. Toward the end of the rhythm strip — ***the pulse is lost***.\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.66-1:** Practice Tracing J.\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing J:** The first 9 beats show a ***regular* WCT \\(***Wide-Complex Tachycardia***\\)** at a rate of ~180/minute. *No* P waves are seen. ***Presume* VT** until *proven* otherwise \\(*= ***List \\#1***, reviewed in Section 02.47*\\). The rhythm then degenerates to **VFib** \\(*Ventricular Fibrillation*\\).\n\n+ While List \\#1 *does* allow for the possibility of SVT with *either* preexisting BBB or aberrant conduction — VT should *always* be presumed until *proven* otherwise. Given deterioration of the rhythm to VFib toward the end of the rhythm strip — the first 9 beats are *virtually* certain to be VT. \n+ Confirmation that the chaotic electrical activity toward the end of the rhythm in Fig. 02.66-1 represents VFib — is forthcoming from the fact that ***the pulse has been lost***. The patient is in need of *immediate* defibrillation\\! \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**02.67 – AV Blocks / AV Dissociation**\n\n\n\n***KEY Clinical *Point:** Diagnosis of the specific *type* of AV block is far *less* important than the ***clinical *context** in which the conduction defect occurs. For example — *immediate *treatment is *not* necessarily needed for all patients with* 3rd degree AV *block\\!\n\n+ Clearly — a pacemaker is indicated for *symptomatic* bradycardia that is *not* readily reversible \\(*not due to drugs or some other treatable cause*\\). \n+ That said, a patient with 3rd degree AV block from acute* inferior *infarction may *not* necessarily need a pacer — IF the patient is *asymptomatic *with junctional escape at *reasonable* rate and a *normal* BP \\(*because AV block in this setting may resolve on its own*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.68 – *Blocked* PACs: *Much More Common than AV Block***\n\nBefore describing the AV Blocks — it is well to emphasize the *KEY* clinical concept we introduced in Section 02.60: The ***commonest* cause** of a **pause** is a ***blocked* PAC**. IF looked for — *blocked* PACs will be found *much* more often than *any* type of AV block.\n\n+ We have already highlighted how to recognize ***blocked* PACs** by the notching \\(*or other deformity*\\) they produce in the T wave at the onset of the pause \\(*See the T waves of beat \\#5 in* Fig. 02.60-1; *and of beat \\#7 in* Fig. 02.60-3\\). \n+ Consider the example in **Figure 02.68-1**. Despite two pauses and the presence of group beating — this rhythm does *not* represent any form of AV block. *Do you see why not?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.68-1:** Despite 2 pauses and group beating — this rhythm does *not* represent any form of AV block. *Why not?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.68-1:** Keeping in mind that *“the most common cause of a pause is a blocked PAC”* — we routinely look for blocked PACs *whenever* we see an unanticipated relative *pause* in the cardiac rhythm.\n\n+ Note that the T wave of *all* beats in Figure 02.68-1 is smooth and rounded — *except* for the T waves of the 2 beats at the *onset* of each short pause \\(= *the T waves of beats \\#2 and \\#6*\\). Instead — the T waves of beats \\#2 and \\#6 are both notched\\! This notching is the result of ***blocked* PACs** that are *hidden* within these T waves \\(*arrows in* **Figure 02.68-2**\\). \n+ As we will see momentarily \\(*in Section 02.72*\\) — there are *other* reasons why the rhythm in Figure 02.68-2 is *not* 2nd degree AV block of the Wenckebach type: **i\\)** the atrial rate is *not* regular; and **ii\\)** the PR interval does *not* progressively increase within groups of beats. \n+ ***Beyond-the-Core:*** Did you notice that the PR interval preceding beat \\#7 in Figure 02.68-1 is *shorter* than the PR interval preceding all other beats? This is because **beat \\#7** is a **junctional *escape* beat** that occurs *just before* the sinus P wave preceding it has a chance to conduct to the ventricles. We expand on this concept later in this chapter in our discussion on AV dissociation \\(*in Sections 02.77, 02.78*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.68-2:** Sinus rhythm with ***blocked* PACs** \\(*arrows*\\). There is *no* AV block in this tracing because: **i\\)** the P-P interval is *not* regular \\(*vertical red lines*\\); and ii\\) the PR interval does *not* progressively increase within groups of beats. *The commonest cause of a pause is a blocked PAC*.\n\n**02.69 – The 3 Degrees of AV Block**\n\nDiagnosis of the different forms of AV block need *not* be difficult. Simply stated — there are **3 degrees** of AV block:\n\n+ **1st degree AV Block** \\(*Section 02.70*\\) — in which *all* impulses from above \\(ie, *from the SA node*\\) are conducted to the ventricles. It is just that they take *longer* than usual to get there \\(ie, *more than 0.20 second in an adult*\\). \n+ **2nd degree AV Block** \\(*Section 02.71*\\) — in which *some* sinus impulses get through the AV node and are conducted to the ventricles, but others do not. \n+ **3rd degree** or ***complete* AV Block** \\(*Section 02.75*\\) — in which *no* sinus impulses get through. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** From a practical, clinical perspective \\(*as we describe momentarily*\\) — the diagnosis of *both* 1st degree and 3rd degree AV block is surprisingly easy\\!\n\n+ Awareness of this important concept tremendously facilitates diagnosis of the AV blocks. That is — IF an AV block is present and the block is *neither* 1st degree *nor* 3rd degree — then it must be *some form* of 2nd degree AV block. \n\n \n\n**02.70 – 1st Degree AV Block**\n\nFirst degree AV block is diagnosed by the finding of a ***prolonged* PR interval**. This is defined as a PR interval that clearly measures ***more*** than **0.20-0.21 second** = clearly *more* than 1 *large* box in duration on ECG grid paper \\(Figure 02.70-1\\).\n\n+ Practically speaking — **1st degree AV block** is simply a sinus rhythm with a *long* PR interval. \n+ The ***isolated* finding** of **1st degree AV block** \\(*even if marked*\\) is usually *not* clinically significant \\(**Figure 02.70-1**\\). This is especially true when a *prolonged* PR interval is seen in an otherwise *healthy* individual who does *not* have underlying heart disease. In contrast — *new* 1st degree AV block in a patient with *acute* evolving infarction \\(*especially if associated with other new conduction defects*\\) — is clearly cause for concern. ***Bottom* Line:** *Clinical correlation is everything\\!* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.70-1:** Sinus rhythm with **1st Degree AV Block**. Each QRS complex is preceded by an *upright* P wave in this lead II rhythm strip with a *fixed* PR interval that clearly *exceeds* 1 large box in duration.\n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** A PR interval that measures **0.20 second** is ***normal***. The PR interval must be clearly *more* than this amount \\(ie, *\u003e0.21-0.22 second*\\) to be “prolonged”.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Given the overall *benign* nature of *isolated* 1st degree AV block and the clinical reality that otherwise healthy young adults may manifest *slight* PR interval prolongation simply as a result of pronounced vagal tone \\(*especially in well-conditioned athletic individuals*\\) — ***our* preference** is ***not*** to call** “1st degree AV block”** *until* the **PR interval** is ***clearly* 0.22 second**. We also favor *not* using the term, *“borderline 1st degree”* when a PR interval in the 0.19-to-0.21 second range is seen in an otherwise healthy individual. All the term ***“borderline PR”*** means — is that you *almost* have a finding that *even if you had*, would clinically mean *nothing*. Instead — our preference is to describe the **PR interval** as *either* being ***“normal”*** or **“long”** \\(*where long means at least 0.21 second in duration, if not ≥0.22 second*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* **Norms** for the PR interval \\(*as well as for QRS interval duration*\\) are ***different* in children**. Pediatric hearts are smaller. It therefore takes *less* time for the electrical impulse to travel through the conduction system of a child. For example — a PR interval of 0.18 second would be long for an infant. When in doubt about norms for a *younger-aged* patient — upper limits for the PR and QRS intervals should be* looked up* in an age-specific table. \n\n \n\n**02.71 – The *3 Types* of 2nd Degree AV Block**\n\nSecond degree AV block is traditionally divided into two types \\(**Mobitz I** *and* **Mobitz II**\\). That said — it is important to recognize that a ***third* type** of 2nd degree AV block also exists \\(*known as*** 2:1 AV block**\\).\n\n+ The distinguishing characteristic of the 2nd degree AV blocks — is that some \\(*but not all*\\) P waves are conducted to the ventricles \\(**Figure 02.71-1**\\). \n+ NOTE: The ***atrial* rate** should be **regular** \\(*or almost regular*\\) when there is AV block \\(*arrows in* Figure 02.71-1\\). It is common to see slight variation \\(*known as ****ventriculophasic* sinus arrhythmia**\\) in the setting of 2nd or 3rd degree AV blocks. However — *marked* P wave irregularity — *change* in P wave morphology — or *prolonged* sinus pauses all suggest some phenomenon *other than* AV block is operative \\(ie, *blocked PACs; escape rhythms without AV block; sick sinus syndrome; sinus arrest*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.71-1:** Sinus rhythm with the 3 types of **2nd Degree AV Block**. In each case — the atrial rhythm is *regular* and some \\(*but not all*\\) beats are conducted. **Rhythm A** — Mobitz I 2nd degree AV block with *gradual* prolongation of the PR interval until a P wave is dropped \\(*Section 02.72*\\). **Rhythm B** — Mobitz II with QRS widening and a *fixed* PR interval until *sudden* loss of conduction with *successive* nonconducted P waves \\(*Section 02.73*\\). **Rhythm C** — 2nd degree AV block with **2:1 AV conduction**. It is impossible to be certain if 2:1 AV block represents Mobitz I or Mobitz II, since we *never* see 2 conducted P waves in a row \\(*Section 02.74*\\).\n\n**02.72 – Mobitz I 2nd Degree AV Block \\(*= AV Wenckebach*\\)**\n\nMobitz I \\(*AV Wenckebach*\\) — is by far the *most* common type of 2nd degree AV block \\(*accounting for ****more than 95% ****of cases in our experience*\\). **Mobitz I** is ***recognized* by**: **i\\)** Progressive *lengthening* of the PR interval *until* a beat is dropped; **ii\\)** Group beating; **iii\\)** A regular \\(*or at least fairly regular*\\) atrial rate; and **iv\\)** The pause that contains the dropped beat is *less* than twice the shortest R-R interval. These characteristics are known as ***“the Footprints of Wenckebach”***. They are *all* present in **Figure 02.72-1**:\n\n\n\n**Figure 02.72-1:** Mobitz I 2nd Degree AV Block \\(= *AV Wenckebach*\\). The PR interval *progressively* lengthens until a beat is dropped \\(*See text*\\).\n\nRegarding the ***“footprints”*** of **Wenckebach** that are seen in Figure 02.72-1:\n\n+ There is ***“group beating”***. This takes the form of **2 groups** encompassing beats \\#1,2,3 and beats \\#4,5 \\(*each group being separated by a pause of approximately equal duration between beats \\#3-4 and between \\#5-6*\\). \n+ The P-P interval is regular \\(*in this case at a rate of 100/minute*\\). \n+ ***Within* groups** — the **PR** interval ***progressively* lengthens** until a beat is dropped. Note the PR interval preceding beat \\#4 gets longer before beat \\#5 *until* the P wave *after* beat \\#5 is nonconducted. The next cycle then begins as the PR interval shortens prior to beat \\#6. \n+ ***Beyond-the-Core:*** Although AV Wenckebach is usually easy enough to diagnose simply by recognition of *progressive* PR interval lengthening *until* a beat is dropped — awareness of the *other* “footprints” may be helpful confirming the diagnosis in less obvious cases. *Not* all “footprints” are present in each case \\(ie, *Wenckebach cycles may be atypical*\\). However, *all* of the “footprints” are present in Figure 02.72-1. Note that in addition to *group* beating — regular *atrial* rate — and *progressive* PR interval lengthening — that the **pause *containing*** the ***dropped* beat** is ***less*** than** twice** the ***shortest* R-R interval**. Thus, in the first group of beats in Figure 02.72-1 \\(*beats \\#1,2,3*\\) — the *shortest* R-R interval is between beats \\#2-3. The pause that contains the dropped beat \\(ie, *the pause between beats \\#3-4*\\) measures *less* than twice this R-R interval between beats \\#2-3. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** Second degree AV block, **Mobitz Type I** — usually occurs at the level of the AV node. As a result — the QRS complex with Mobitz I will usually be narrow.\n\n+ Mobitz I is most often associated with *inferior* MI — it often *spontaneously* resolves — and it often responds to Atropine \\(*which works on the AV node*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.73 – Mobitz II 2nd Degree AV Block**\n\nMobitz II 2nd degree AV block — is recognized by QRS widening with a ***constant* PR interval** for ***consecutively* conducted beats** — *until *one or more beats are dropped \\(Figure 02.73-1\\).\n\n+ **Mobitz II** — occurs *lower* down in the conduction system. As a result — the QRS complex is usually wide. The problem with Mobitz II is its disturbing tendency to *abruptly* go from regular conduction of P waves to *nonconduction* of multiple P waves in a row, sometimes leading to ventricular standstill. This explains why **pacing** is almost always needed with *true* Mobitz II 2nd degree AV block. \n+ The features of Mobitz II are illustrated in **Figure 02.73-1**. Note that the QRS complex is wide. The underlying atrial rate \\(*P-P interval*\\) is regular. Following normal conduction of the first 3 beats on the tracing — there is *nonconduction* of multiple subsequent P waves. \n+ *Unlike* Mobitz I — the **PR interval** remains ***constant*** preceding all QRS complexes that do conduct to the ventricles \\(*beats \\#1,2,3; \\#4,5*\\). \n+ **PEARL:** The *KEY* for diagnosing Mobitz II is that the PR interval remains constant for *consecutively* conducted P waves \\(*seen for the PR interval preceding beats \\#1,2,3 in *Figure 02.73-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.73-1:** Mobitz II 2nd Degree AV Block. The PR interval is *constant* preceding *all* QRS complexes that *do* conduct to the ventricles. Note that the QRS complex is wide and that there are *consecutively* conducted complexes early in the tracing prior to onset of AV block.\n\n**02.74 – 2-to-1 AV Block: *Mobitz I *or* Mobitz II?***\n\nThe **3rd type** of **2nd degree AV Block** — occurs when there is 2:1 AV conduction — in which *every-other P wave *is conducted \\(**Tracing C** *in* Figure 02.71-1, *which we reproduce below in* **Figure 02.74-1**\\). We can *not* be certain IF **2:1 AV block** represents Mobitz I or Mobitz II — because we *never* see 2 beats conducted in a row. Therefore — we simply *don’t know* if the PR interval would progressively lengthen IF given a chance to do so.\n\n+ NOTE: It is *likely* that the example of **2:1 AV Block** seen in Figure 02.74-1 represents **Mobitz I** because: **i\\)** Mobitz I is *much more common* than Mobitz II; and **ii\\)** the QRS is narrow. That said — We can *not* tell for sure \\(*since we never see 2 conducted beats in a row in *Figure 02.74.1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.74-1:** 2nd Degree Block with **2:1 AV Conduction**. Although we *suspect* this is Mobitz I \\(*since the QRS is narrow *and* Mobitz I is so much more common*\\) — we can *not* tell for certain because we *never* see 2 *consecutively* conducted P waves.\n\n***Additional* CLUES Suggesting Mobitz I:** *Serial* tracings and the clinical setting may provide *additional* clues in support of the diagnosis of Mobitz I for the rhythm in Figure 02.74-1:\n\n+ Although possible — it is ***rare*** for a patient **to go *back-and-forth* between Mobitz I *and* Mobitz II** forms of AV block. Therefore, IF there is clear evidence elsewhere that this patient manifested Mobitz I \\(*from the patients chart; from ongoing telemetry monitoring*\\) — then it is highly likely that the 2:1 AV conduction block seen in Figure 02.74-1 also represents Mobitz I. \n+ Finally — IF 2:1 AV block occurs in association with **acute *inferior* infarction** — then **Mobitz I** is far more likely \\(*since occlusion of the right coronary artery commonly impedes blood supply to both the inferior wall of the left ventricle *and* the AV nodal artery*\\). In contrast — acute *anterior* infarction is much more likely to result in Mobitz II than Mobitz I AV block. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** Although there is 2:1 AV block in Figure 02.74-1 — the ventricular rate is *not* overly slow \\(*the R-R interval is 6 large boxes; the ventricular rate is 50/minute*\\). As a result — there is an *excellent* chance that this patient may be hemodynamically stable *despite* AV block.\n\n+ Immediate treatment may therefore *not* be needed. IF the patient became hypotensive with the rhythm shown in Figure 02.74-1 — initial treatment with Atropine would be reasonable and have reasonable chance to be effective given that the QRS complex is narrow. \n\n \n\n**FIGURE 02.74-2: *Follow-Up Tracing to Figure 02.74-1***\n\nA little while *after* the rhythm in Figure 02.74-1 was recorded — the ***follow-up* tracing** in Figure 02.74-2 is seen on the monitor.\n\n+ Does this *new* rhythm labeled **Tracing D** in **Figure 02.74-2** *confirm* our suspicion that the 2:1 AV block seen previously in **Tracing C** \\(Fig. 02.74-1\\) is the result of **Mobitz I** 2nd degree AV block? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.74-2:** Tracing D is the ***follow-up* rhythm strip** obtained a short while *after* Tracing C \\(Fig. 02.74.1\\) was recorded. Does tracing D *confirm* that the rhythm in Tracing C represents Mobitz I?\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.74-2:** The first 3 beats in **Tracing D** show a *definite Wenckebach* cycle \\(*progressively lengthening PR interval until the P wave after beat \\#3 is nonconducted*\\). 2:1 AV block then *resumes* with beat \\#4 in Tracing D. But because it is *rare* for 2nd degree AV block to alternate between Mobitz I and Mobitz II — it is *virtually* certain that the *entire* sequence of events seen in Tracings C and D of Figure 02.74-2 represent 2nd degree AV block, **Mobitz I**.\n\n**02.75 – 3rd Degree \\(*Complete*\\) AV Block**\n\nComplete \\(*or 3rd degree*\\) AV block — is said to be present when *none* of the impulses from above \\(*P waves*\\) are able to conduct to the ventricles. In this case — there is ***complete* AV Dissociation** — because *none* of the P waves are related to any of the QRS complexes. The result is that **2 *independent* rhythms** are going on. One of these rhythms will be ***from* “above”** \\(*in the form of regularly occurring sinus P waves*\\). The *other* ongoing rhythm will be ***from* “below”** \\(*in the form of an escape rhythm originating either from the AV node, the His, or the ventricles*\\). Awareness of these features facilitates recognition and understanding of diagnostic criteria for what **3rd degree AV block** is — and *what* it is not:\n\n+ With complete AV block — *none *of the impulses from above \\(*sinus P waves*\\) are able to penetrate the AV node to arrive at the ventricles. As a result — there will be regular \\(*or almost regular*\\) atrial activity — and a regular \\(*or almost regular*\\) ventricular escape rhythm \\(**Figure 02.75-1**\\). \n+ There is ***complete* AV dissociation** in Figure 02.75.1 \\(ie, *none of the P waves are related to any QRS complexes*\\). As a result — **P waves** are seen to ***“march through”*** the **QRS**, occurring at *all* phases of the R-R cycle. This is most easily seen by focusing on *each* QRS complex in *both* Rhythm A and Rhythm B in Fig. 02.75-1 — and seeing that the PR interval immediately *preceding* each QRS *continually* changes. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.75-1:** Anatomic levels of 3rd degree AV block. **Rhythm A:** Complete AV block at the *ventricular* level. There is a regular atrial rhythm \\(*arrows*\\) — and the QRS is wide with an idioventricular *escape* rhythm at a rate *between* 20-40/minute. **Rhythm B:** Complete AV block at a *higher* level \\(*probably in the AV node*\\) — as suggested by the presence of a *narrow* QRS escape rhythm at a rate *between* 40-60/minute **NOTE:** *White *arrows in this Figure represent *presumed* P waves that are *hidden* within the ST segment.\n\n**NOTE:** The *anatomic* level of *complete* AV block may vary. Most commonly — the level of block will occur *below* the AV node with a resultant ***ventricular* escape** rhythm \\(**Rhythm A*** in *Figure 02.75-1\\). When this happens — the **QRS** of the ***escape* rhythm** will be ***wide*** and the ***escape* rate** will be ***between* 20-40/minute**.\n\n+ The anatomic level of block may occur at a ***higher* level** within the conduction system \\(*either within the AV node or the Bundle of His*\\). When this happens — the **QRS** of the ***escape* rhythm** will be ***narrow***. IF the escape rhythm arises from the **AV node** — the ***escape* rate** will typically be ***between* 40-60/minute** \\(*as seen in* **Rhythm B** *of *Fig. 02.75-1\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* IF the escape rhythm arises from the **Bundle of His** — the QRS complex will again be *narrow,* but the escape rate may be slower. One may therefore surmise the *probable* anatomic level of block based on characteristics of the escape rhythm \\(*QRS width and escape rate*\\) — realizing that exceptions may exist in patients with preexisting conduction defects *and/or* influence by medications, hypoxemia, acute ischemia/infarction, etc. \n\n \n\n***KEY Clinical *Point:** More important than the anatomic level of block per se in *initial* management is the patient’s *hemodynamic* status. For example — a hypotensive patient with altered mental status and *complete* AV block associated with an escape rate of 40/minute will still be in dire need of immediate treatment *regardless* of whether the escape rhythm manifests a wide or narrow QRS complex.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Knowing that the escape rhythm QRS complex is *narrow* suggests *greater* potential for reversibility and *beneficial* response to Atropine. \n\n \n\n**02.76 – PEARLS for Recognizing/*Confirming Complete* AV Block**\n\nMost of the time IF the degree AV block is complete \\(*3rd degree*\\) — then **the *ventricular* rhythm should be at least *fairly* regular**. This is because *escape* rhythms arising from the AV node, the His or ventricles are **usually *fairly* regular** rhythms. Exceptions may occur during cardiopulmonary resuscitation — but even then, there will usually be a *recognizable* pattern of ventricular regularity.\n\n+ If the ventricular rhythm in a tracing with AV block is *not* regular \\(*or at least almost regular*\\) — then it is likely that *some* conduction is occurring \\(ie, *rather than 3rd degree *—* there is probably high-grade 2nd degree AV block*\\). Note that the R-R interval is regular for *both* examples of complete AV block shown in Figure 02.75-1. \n\n \n\n*Confirmation* of *complete* AV block *requires* that **P waves *fail* to conduct *despite* being given *adequate* opportunity to do so**. Satisfying this requirement provides the evidence needed to distinguish complete AV block from AV dissociation due to other causes. To do this — one *must* see P waves in *all* phases of the R-R cycle \\(ie, *having opportunity to conduct *—* but still failing to do so*\\).\n\n+ For example, in **Tracing A** of Fig. 02.75-1 \\(*which we reproduce below*\\) — the P wave hidden within the T wave of beat \\#3 \\(*white arrow*\\) would *not* be expected to conduct to the ventricles \\(*because it occurs during the absolute refractory period*\\). In contrast, virtually all other P waves in Tracing A occur at points in the cardiac cycle that should allow opportunity to conduct — yet *none* of them do. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Tracing A** *from* **Figure 02.75-1:** Complete AV block at the *ventricular* level.\n\nSimilarly, in **Tracing B** of Fig. 02.75-1 \\(*which we reproduce below*\\) — the P wave that notches the terminal portion of the T wave of beat \\#3 and the P wave hidden *within* the QRS complex of beat \\#4 each occur at a time when conduction is *not* expected \\(*white arrows in* Tracing B\\). However, *all other P waves* in this tracing should have opportunity to conduct — yet *fail* to do so.\n\n\n\n**Tracing B** *from* **Figure 02.75-1:** Complete AV block at a *higher* level \\(*probably in the AV node*\\) — as suggested by the presence of a *narrow* QRS escape rhythm at a rate *between* 40-60/minute\n\n***KEY Clinical *Point:** In order to *guarantee* that P waves will have adequate opportunity to conduct — the rate of the escape rhythm should ideally *not* exceed 50/minute. Escape rates faster than this often result in inopportune timing of P waves that mitigates against having an adequate opportunity to conduct. In such instances \\(*when the escape rate is well over 50/minute*\\) — a much *longer* period of monitoring will be needed to ensure that the degree of AV block is complete. Note that the *escape* rate is *below* 50/minute for *both* examples of AV block in Figure 02.75-1 — further supporting our conclusion that the degree of AV block is indeed complete in *each* case.\n\n**02.77 – AV Dissociation**\n\nThe term, ***“AV dissociation”*** — simply means that for a certain period of time sinus P waves are *not* related to neighboring QRS complexes. That is, the P waves preceding the QRS are *not* being conducted to the ventricles.\n\n+ AV dissociation may be intermittent, recurrent and short-lived – or – it may be persistent and permanent, as occurs with complete AV block. \n+ **AV dissociation is *never* a “diagnosis”**. Instead — it is a condition caused by “something else”. The task for the clinician is to figure out what the cause of AV dissociation is for any given rhythm. This assignment is far more than academic — since *appropriate* management depends on figuring out the cause of AV dissociation. Active treatment may or may not be indicated. For example — optimal treatment of *complete* AV dissociation with an accelerated junctional rhythm due to digitalis toxicity is simple: IF the patient is hemodynamically stable — simply *stop* digoxin\\! No pacemaker is needed *despite* that fact that *none* of the P waves on the tracing may be conducting. \n+ ***Complete* AV dissociation is *not* the same as *complete* AV block**\\! This is one of the most commonly *misunderstood* concepts in all of arrhythmia interpretation. Complete AV block is just *one* of 3 possible causes of AV dissociation. As we will see momentarily — patients with “complete AV dissociation” may actually have *no* degree of AV block at all … \n+ Always try to determine *which* of the **3 Causes** of** AV Dissociation** is operative. The 3 possible causes are: **i\\) AV block** itself \\(*either from 2nd or 3rd degree AV block*\\); **ii\\) Usurpation** — in which P waves *transiently* do not conduct because an *accelerated* junctional or ventricular rhythm takes over the pacemaking function \\(ie, *“usurps” the rhythm*\\); and **iii\\) Default** — in which a junctional or ventricular *escape* rhythm takes over by *\"default\"* because the rate of the sinus pacemaker has *slowed down* for whatever reason. \n\n \n\n**02.78 – FIGURE 02.78-1: *Is there any AV Block?***\n\nConsider the rhythm strip shown in **Figure 02.78-1**. Are the P waves that are seen in this tracing \\(*red arrows*\\) being conducted to the ventricles?\n\n+ IF so — Which one or two P waves are likely to be conducting? \n+ Which P waves are clearly *not* conducting? \n+ Is AV block present?

If so — what *degree* of AV block is present? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.78-1:** Full interpretation of the rhythm strip shown here is problematic because: **i\\)** We are *not* provided with information about the clinical setting; **ii\\)** The rhythm strip is short \\(*just over 4 seconds in duration*\\); and **iii\\)** We do *not* get to see the *immediately-preceding* rhythm strips that are likely to reveal what is truly going on. That said — what *can* be stated about the rhythm in **Figure 02.78-1** is the following:\n\n+ The ***underlying* rhythm** appears to be **sinus** – as suggested by **beat \\#1** which is preceded by an *upright* P wave with *reasonable* PR interval \\(*of 0.18 second*\\) in this lead II monitoring lead. \n+ The ***ventricular* rhythm** is ***regular*** at a rate ***just over* 50/minute** \\(*the R-R interval is just under 6 large boxes in duration*\\). \n+ The **QRS** complex is ***narrow***. For practical purposes — this means that the rhythm is **supraventricular** \\(*arising from either the SA node as in sinus rhythm *—* or from the AV node*\\). \n+ The **P waves *preceding* beats \\#3** and** \\#4** in Fig. 02.78-1 are definitely ***not* conducting**. They *can’t* be — since the PR interval preceding these beats is clearly *too short* to conduct. \n+ The P wave preceding **beat \\#2** is also probably *not* conducting. Although the PR interval preceding beat \\#2 is *not* necessarily “too short to conduct” — it is clearly *less* than the PR interval preceding beat \\#1. Given that we *know* the P waves preceding beats \\#3 and \\#4 are not conducting — it is highly likely that the P wave preceding beat \\#2 is also *not* conducting. \n+ The ***atrial* rate** \\(*as defined by the P-P interval*\\) is ***regular*** at **50/minute** \\(*the P-P interval is precisely 6 large boxes in duration*\\). \n+ Regardless of whether the P wave preceding beat \\#2 is or is not conducting — **the* “theme”*** of the rhythm in Figure 02.78-1 is that there is **initial *sinus* bradycardia** \\(*beat \\#1*\\) at a rate of 50/minute — followed by a period of AV dissociation \\(*since P waves preceding subsequent beats are definitely not conducting*\\). This is **AV Dissociation *by* Default** \\(ie, *default from sinus node slowing that allows emergence of an appropriate junctional escape rhythm at 52/minute*\\). \n\n \n\n***KEY Clinical* Point:** There really is *no* evidence of any AV block at all in Figure 02.78-1. *None* of the P waves that fail to conduct have any reasonable chance to conduct \\(*since the PR interval is simply too short before an appropriate junctional escape rhythm supervenes*\\).\n\n+ What occurs in Figure 02.78-1 is commonly seen among healthy adolescents and young adults during sleep *and/or* undergoing anesthesia. The sinus rate *temporarily* slows — and an *appropriate* junctional escape rhythm arises to the rescue. There is *no* AV block. There is *no* pathology. There is *no* need for acute intervention. Instead — optimal treatment is “benign neglect” \\(*the clinician is perhaps better off not knowing that transient AV dissociation may be occurring in such otherwise healthy and asymptomatic individuals*\\). \n\n \n\n**BOTTOM Line:** The ***correct* diagnosis** for the rhythm in **Figure 02.78-1** is: *Sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by default, resulting in an appropriate junctional escape rhythm at 52/minute*. Nothing more need be written in your interpretation.\n\n+ ***Beyond-the-Core:*** Although we assumed that beat \\#1 in Figure 02.78-1 is conducting — We actually do *not* know for certain that this is true. This is because we *never* see 2 beats in a row that conduct with the same PR interval. Therefore, *it could be* that the patient’s *underlying* rhythm is sinus with *marked* 1st degree AV block — and that beat \\#1 also manifests AV dissociation. That said, *regardless* of whether or not beat \\#1 is conducting — the “theme” of this rhythm is still sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by default. The need for clinical correlation to guide management remains the same \\(ie, *no immediate intervention is needed IF the patient is asymptomatic and the setting benign*\\). \n\n \n\n**02.79 – SUMMARY: *Complete AV Block *vs* AV Dissociation***\n\nWe summarize the subject of AV Dissociation by **Figure 02.79-1** — in which all 3 the causes are illustrated. Note the following:\n\n+ **Rhythm A** in Figure 02.79-1: Although there is obvious AV dissociation \\(*since the PR interval for several P waves is too short to conduct*\\) — there is *not* necessarily any AV block. We interpret this rhythm as sinus bradycardia with AV dissociation by ***default*** — resulting in an *appropriate* junctional *escape* rhythm at 52/minute \\(*See Answer to *Fig. 02.78-1\\). \n+ **Rhythm B:** There is **AV dissociation *by* usurpation**. Beats \\#1 and \\#2 are sinus conducted with a normal PR interval. The PR interval then shortens. We *know* that P waves preceding beats \\#4 and \\#5 in Rhythm B are *not* conducting \\(*the PR interval is clearly too short to conduct*\\). No P waves at all are seen after beat \\#5. The reason is that an ***accelerated* junctional rhythm** \\(*at 78/minute*\\) has ***“usurped”*** the pacemaking function from the SA node \\(*that was beating at 75/minute*\\). This situation is commonly seen in ***digitalis* toxicity**. Although the sinus P waves preceding beats \\#4 and 5 in Rhythm B are *not* conducting \\(*and the P preceding beat \\#3 is probably also not conducting*\\) — *none* of these P waves have any reasonable chance to conduct. Thus, despite *nonconduction* of P waves — there is *no* evidence of any AV block. It is likely that AV dissociation will spontaneously *resolve* once the cause of the accelerated junctional rhythm is discovered and corrected. \n+ **Rhythm C:** There is **AV dissociation *due to* 3rd Degree AV Block**. As opposed to Rhythm A and Rhythm B, in which *nonconducting* P waves *do not have any reasonable chance* to conduct — P waves in **Rhythm C** occur at *all* points in the cardiac cycle. We would anticipate that virtually *all* of the P waves indicated by *solid red arrows* in Rhythm C should have a chance to conduct. Despite this — *none* of these P waves conduct. Instead — **P waves *“march through”* the QRS** throughout Rhythm C. In addition — the ventricular escape rhythm is *less* than 50/minute. **Rhythm C** therefore fulfills criteria for ***complete* AV block** as the cause of AV dissociation. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.79-1:** The 3 causes of AV dissociation. **Rhythm A** — AV dissociation by ***default*** of the sinus pacemaker which has slowed; **Rhythm B** — AV dissociation by ***usurpation*** of the rhythm by another *accelerated* pacemaker \\(*which in this case arises from the AV node*\\); and **Rhythm C** — AV dissociation due to **AV block** — which could be *either* 2nd degree, or as in Rhythm C, a **3rd degree AV block** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.80 – *High-Grade* 2nd-Degree AV Block**\n\nA term is needed to describe the situation in **Figure 02.80-1**.\n\n+ How would you interpret this rhythm? \n+ Is there AV block? IF so — Is the conduction disturbance likely to represent Mobitz I or Mobitz II forms of AV block? *Justify* your answer. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.80-1:** Is the rhythm in this figure Mobitz I or Mobitz II AV block? What is *“high-grade”* AV block?\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.80-1:** As for assessment of *any* cardiac arrhythmia — once you have ensured that the patient is *hemodynamically* stable — ***“Watch your Ps, Qs and the 3Rs”*** \\(*Section 02.1*\\):\n\n+ **P** waves — are present and regular \\(*red arrows in ***Figure 02.80-2**\\). \n+ **Q**RS complex — is narrow \\(*clearly less than half a large box*\\). \n+ The **3 Rs** — The *atrial* rate is 100/minute; the ventricular rhythm is irregular; *some* P waves conduct — *others do not*. \n\n \n\n**Impression:** *Some* degree of **AV block** is present in Figure 02.80-2. We establish this by recognition of: **i\\)** a regular *atrial* rate; and **ii\\)** the fact that *some* P waves conduct but others *do not*.\n\n+ The conduction disturbance in Figure 02.80-2 is clearly *not* simple 1st degree AV block. We can also recognize *at a glance* that this rhythm is *not* 3rd degree AV block because: **i\\)** the ventricular rhythm is *not* at all regular \\(*Section 02.76*\\); and **ii\\)** *some* P waves are conducting. Therefore — the rhythm in Figure 02.80-2 must be a form of **2nd degree AV block**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.80-2:** *Arrows* have been *added* to Figure 02.80-1 to indicate *regularly* occurring P waves *throughout* the tracing. *Some* P waves conduct — but *others don’t*. The rhythm is therefore **2nd degree AV block** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Which Form* of 2nd-Degree AV Block****?** There are features of *each* type of 2nd degree AV block in Figure 02.80-2:\n\n+ The first 3 beats are consistent with **Mobitz I** because: **i\\)** Mobitz I is far more common than Mobitz II; **ii\\)** the QRS complex is narrow; and **iii\\)** the PR interval *progressively* increases from beat \\#1 — to beat \\#2 — to beat \\#3. The P wave after beat \\#3 is nonconducted. The cycle then resumes with *shortening* of the PR interval prior to beat \\#4. \n+ There is **2:1 AV block** for beats \\#4, 5 and 6 — as *every-other-P wave* is conducted \\(*confirmed by the constant PR interval preceding the QRS complex of beats 4, 5, 6*\\). \n+ Two P waves *in a row* are nonconducted between beat \\#3 and beat \\#4. While on occasion, multiple successive *nonconducted* P waves may be seen with Mobitz I 2nd degree AV block — this finding is *much more suggestive* of a more severe **Mobitz II** conduction disturbance \\(*Section 02.73*\\). \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** *More* important than determining the specific *“type”* of 2nd degree AV block for the rhythm in Figure 02.80-2 are: **i\\)** the *hemodynamic* effect of the conduction defect; and **ii\\)** clinical implications and potential need for a pacemaker. As a compromise to reflect our *increased* clinical concern given ***successive* nonconduction of P waves** — we favor use of the term ***“high-grade”* AV block** for the conduction disturbance seen in Figure 02.80-2.\n\n+ NOTE: There are *many* variations on the above “theme” — in which the degree of AV block is *not quite complete* and *not* necessarily conforming to either pure Mobitz I or Mobitz II — yet clearly of ***increased* clinical concern** due to nonconduction of multiple beats with resultant overly *slow* ventricular rate. \n\n \n\n**02.81 – *Ventricular *Standstill vs AV Block**\n\nConfusion sometimes arises in the terminology used to describe certain ventricular or arrest rhythms related to complete AV block. The 4 rhythms illustrated in **Figure 02.81-1** will hopefully clarify the terminology used:\n\n+ **Rhythm A** \\(*repeated from *Figure 02.75-1\\) — represents ***complete* AV block** at the ventricular level. There is a regular *atrial* rhythm \\(*red arrows*\\) and a regular *ventricular* rhythm — but *none* of the P waves conduct to the ventricles. Instead — P waves *“march through”* the QRS complex with a *continually* changing PR interval. Note that the ventricular escape rate is slow \\(*well below 50/minute*\\) — and that P waves have more than adequate *opportunity* to conduct, yet still *fail* to do so \\(*Section 02.75*\\). \n+ **Rhythm B** — represents ***ventricular* standstill**. Atrial activity continues \\(*in the form of regularly-occurring P waves*\\) — but *no* QRS complexes are seen. Clinical implications of this rhythm are usually the same as for asystole. Patients with **Mobitz II** 2nd degree AV block sometimes suddenly go from minimal nonconduction of beats to ventricular standstill \\(*which is why pacing is generally needed for patients with Mobitz II AV block*\\). \n+ **Rhythm C** — represents a **slow *idioventricular* rhythm** — seen here with an escape rate just over 30/minute \\(*Section 02.37*\\). This is *not* a form of AV block — because there are *no* P waves. Instead — following sinus arrest and failure of an AV nodal escape pacemaker to arise — there *fortunately* is appearance of a **ventricular *escape* rhythm** \\(*without which there would have been asystole*\\). \n+ **Rhythm D** — represents **asystole**. There is no sign of any electrical activity \\(*No P waves; No QRS complexes*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.81-1:** Clarification of *complete* AV block \\(**Rhythm A**\\) — ventricular *standstill* \\(**Rhythm B**\\) — slow *idioventricular* escape \\(**Rhythm C**\\) — and *asystole* in **Rhythm D** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**02.82 – Hyperkalemia vs AV Block**\n\nThe incidence of ***Hyperkalemia*** has clearly increased in recent years. Reasons for this increase are multiple — but include the obesity epidemic with corresponding increase in the incidence of diabetes and improved treatment of diabetes resulting in increased longevity. As a result — many more patients with diabetes now live long enough to develop complications associated with *end-stage* kidney disease. Hyperkalemia is perhaps the most immediately *life-threatening* complication seen in this group of patients.\n\n+ Many more patients than ever before are now on **dialysis**. Hyperkalemia should *always* be thought of in such patients whenever they present with either an unusual \\(*or bizarre*\\) 12-lead ECG *and/or* a cardiac arrhythmia. \n+ Chronic kidney disease patients who are not yet on dialysis may also develop hyperkalemia — especially if any of a number of ***predisposing* situations** are present. Among others, these include: **i\\)** taking potassium-retaining medications \\(*ACE-inhibitors; angiotensin-receptor-blocking drugs; certain diuretics; potassium supplements*\\); **ii\\)** dehydration; **iii\\)** acidosis; **iv\\)** abrupt reduction in urine output; and **v\\)** cardiac arrest. \n+ **Hyperkalemia** is ***notorious*** for its ability to **mimic *other* ECG conditions** \\(*Section 11*\\). Among ECG changes produced by more severe degrees of hyperkalemia \\(*common once serum potassium exceeds 6-6.5 mEq/L*\\) include: **i\\)** marked ***peaking*** of **T waves** in multiple leads; **ii\\) QRS widening**; **iii\\) *reduced* P wave amplitude** — sometimes with complete ***loss*** of **P waves** \\(*despite persistence of sinus conduction*\\); **iv\\)** bizarre frontal plane ***axis* shifts**; and **v\\) ST-T wave changes** that may mimic ischemia/acute infarction \\(*ST elevation or depression; T wave peaking and/or deep T wave inversion*\\). \n\n \n\nRelevance of the above information on Hyperkalemia to this Section on AV Block is highlighted by the rhythm in **Figure 02.82-1**.\n\n+ Should the patient whose rhythm is shown in Figure 02.82-1 be treated with Atropine *and/or* pacing? \n+ HINT: How might your answer to this question *change* IF told that this patient was alert and had a history of chronic kidney disease? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.82-1:** Ventricular rhythm at ~40/minute. How should this patient be treated? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.82-1:** A regular ventricular \\(*wide QRS*\\) rhythm is seen in this tracing at a rate of ~40/minute. There are no P waves. While our *initial* impression is that of a **ventricular *escape* rhythm** \\(*as most commonly occurs in a setting of cardiac arrest*\\) — pending the need for *additional* information, ***other* possibilities** should be entertained. For example — IF told that this patient was hemodynamically stable, alert and on longterm dialysis \\(*or that he/she had a history of chronic kidney disease*\\) — then a ***stat* potassium** value becomes essential for optimal management:\n\n+ QRS *widening* — the *slow* ventricular rate — *lack* of P waves — and suggestion of T wave *peaking* in Figure 02.82-1 are *all* consistent with a *possible* diagnosis of hyperkalemia. \n+ IF the diagnosis is **hyperkalemia** — then ***immediate* treatment** would be *very different* than treatment of slow ventricular escape in a patient with cardiac arrest whose serum potassium is normal. As opposed to Atropine, use of a pressor agent *and/or* Pacing — **IV Calcium**, **Bicarb** *and/or* **D50 *plus* Insulin** may become the treatment\\(s\\) of choice. \n\n \n\n**02.83 – FIGURE 02.83-1: *Is there any AV Block at all?***\n\n+ We conclude this brief section on AV block with the rhythm in **Figure 02-63**. Is there AV block? If so — What *type* of AV block is present? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.83-1:** Is there AV block? If so — What type? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 02.83-1:** Although it is tempting to interpret the rhythm in this tracing as 2:1 AV block — this is *not* what is happening\\!\n\n+ Assuming the patient is *hemodynamically* stable — We once again assess the 5 key parameters for rhythm determination by the *systematic* **Ps, Qs** and **3R Approach**: The QRS complex is narrow. P waves *are* present — and 2 P waves are seen for each QRS \\(*blue and red arrows in ***Figure 02.83-2**\\) — but P waves are *not* regular in this rhythm strip. This is the 1st clue that the rhythm in Figure 02.83-2 does *not* represent a form of AV block \\(*Section 02.71*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 02.83-2:** Red and blue arrows have been added to Figure 02.83-1 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n+ *Every-other-P wave* in Figure 02.83-2 is conducting. We *know* this — because the PR interval preceding *each* QRS on the tracing is constant \\(*blue arrows*\\). Therefore — the ***underlying* rhythm** is **sinus**. \n+ *Every-other-P wave* is early \\(*red arrows*\\). Note P wave morphology of each *early* P wave is *different* in shape \\(*triphasic*\\) than the *biphasic* P wave of sinus beats. Thus, the rhythm is ***atrial* bigeminy**. *Every-other-P* wave is a PAC that occurs *so early* that it is blocked \\(*red arrows*\\). \n+ ***Bottom *Line:** The rhythm in Figure 02.83-2 is a fitting way to end this Section on AV Blocks. ***The most common cause of a pause*** — is a ***blocked* PAC**. *Blocked* PACs are far *more* common than any form of AV block. They *will* be found IF looked for. Remembering this clinical reality \\(*Section 02.68*\\) — and remembering to *always* assess *each* cardiac rhythm ***systematically*** by the **Ps, Qs \u0026 3R Approach** will facilitate recognizing AV block when it *does* occur — and help *avoid* misdiagnosis when instead one of the *AV-block-mimics* is present. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.0 – Doing an ECG / Technical Errors**\n\n\n\nThe importance of correct lead placement and awareness of potential technical mishaps cannot be overstated. We begin this Section with overview comments on lead derivation and placement. This will enhance appreciation of the PEARLS we then present on *recognizing* artifact and lead placement errors.\n\n**03.1 – *Limb* Leads: *Basic Concepts/Placement***\n\nA ***standard* ECG** is recorded by use of **10 electrodes**, which results in a recording that shows **12 ECG leads**. Four of these electrodes are “limb lead electrodes” — which are placed on each of the 4 extremities \\(**Figure 03.1-1**\\). The other 6 electrodes are placed on the chest, as described in Section 03.6.\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.1-1:** Limb lead electrodes are placed on each extremity \\(*left panel*\\). Derivation of the 3 *standard* limb leads \\(*leads I,II,III*\\) is shown in the *right* panel. **NOTE:** The **4th *extremity* electrode** is placed on the ***right* leg** \\(**RL**\\). This RL electrode had traditionally been used as a ground lead — though in modern ECG recording systems, it is now used more to reduce external interference.\n\nNote on the *left* in Figure 03.1-1 — that the **4 limb lead electrodes** are shown placed on the 4 extremities — but that on the *right* we schematically suggest a more *proximal* location for limb lead electrode placement.\n\n+ Depending on institution practice where you reside — you are likely to encounter *other* slight variations in such placement. The “good news” — is that since \\(*for the most part*\\) — the body is a fairly homogeneous conductor of electricity — there will usually be no more than minimal \\(*if any*\\) variation in QRS morphology as a result of such variation in electrode lead placement. \n+ That said — Realize that there may on occasion be variation in QRST morphology because of different limb lead electrode placement \\(*Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). For example — *small* Q waves may be present on one tracing and *not* on another. This could potentially lead to misinterpretation of new or prior infarction**. PEARL:** *Be consistent\\!* Do *not* change electrode placement at your site of practice from one day-to-the-next. Ensuring that all who record ECGs in your site of practice use the *same* electrode lead placement procedure will lead to consistency — and enable effective use of comparison serial tracings to establish that new findings are truly \"new\" \\(*and not the result of different recording technique*\\). \n+ Despite one's best efforts to be consistent in recording limb lead placement — there may still on occasion be instances when you'll need to deviate slightly from procedure. Examples include patients with limb amputation *and/or* patients with significant tremor that impedes more distal placement. The *KEY* in such instances is to note *on the actual ECG* what the problem is \\(ie, *marked tremor*\\) — and what the change in recording procedure is that you have made \\(ie, *\"used more proximal lead placement”, or other adjustment*\\). This way — IF you encounter a change in QRST morphology — you'll *know* that altered technique may have had a contributing role in producing that change. \n\n \n\n**03.2 – *Why 10 Electrodes but 12 Leads?***\n\nThe reason there are only 10 electrodes **\\(***but 12 standard ECG leads***\\)** — is that **one** of the electrodes \\(*on the right leg*\\) is *not* used to derive ECG waveforms — and the 6 limb leads are derived from the remaining **3** extremity electrodes \\(*on the right arm, left arm, and left leg*\\). Together with the **6** chest lead electrodes — this makes a total of 1\\+3\\+6 = **10 electrodes** used to record **12 ECG leads**.\n\n+ The theoretical basis of electrocardiography arose from the premise put forth by ***Willem* Einthoven**, who in 1903 invented the first ECG machine. Einthoven stated that the ***heart*** lies in the ***center*** of an ***equilateral* electrical triangle** \\(Figure 3.2-1\\) While anatomically, the heart is *not quite* at the “center” of this triangle — Einthoven’s original premise remains accurate enough that more than 100 years later, this concept still explains many of the fundamental principles of electrocardiography. \n+ An **ECG** recording is simply the ***graphic* representation** of the **heart’s *electrical* activity**. It is *nothing more — *and *nothing less*. This electrical activity is recorded by the 10 monitoring electrodes* — *and then displayed in a series of waveforms that make up the standard 12-lead ECG. \n+ **NOTE-1:** An electrical wavefront travels from a *negative* to *positive* recording electrode. A wave of depolarization that is seen as *approaching* a monitoring electrode — will write an ***upward ***\\(*positive*\\)** deflection** on ECG in the lead it approaches. It will write a ***downward ***\\(*negative*\\)** deflection** in the lead it moves away from. \n+ **NOTE-2:** Einthoven *arbitrarily* selected the ***left* shoulder** \\(= **LA** —* or left arm*\\) to be ***positive*** when recording **lead I**. The groin \\(= **LL** —* or left leg*\\) electrode was selected to be positive when recording leads II and III. In this way — a *majority* of QRS complexes in the limb leads will be predominantly positive in *most* leads in the electrocardiograms of *most* individuals \\(**Figure 03.2-1**\\). \n+ **NOTE-3:** As will be discussed in Section 03.3 — the ECG waveform that is seen on ECG for the 3 *standard* limb leads \\(*leads I,II,III*\\) is derived from the *difference* in electrical potential *between* 2 of the limb lead electrodes. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.2-1:** Electrically — the heart lies near the “center” of an *equilateral* triangle \\(***Einthoven’s* Triangle**\\). Because *each* of the angles in an *equilateral* triangle has **60 degrees** — each of the **standard *limb* leads** \\(*leads I,II,III*\\) are separated from each other by 60 degrees. The ECG waveform for each of these limb leads is derived from the *difference* in electrical potential *between* 2 of the limb lead electrodes \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** In 2007 — an esteemed group of electrocardiography experts put forth an ACC/AHA/HRS *Scientific* Statement of Recommendations for *Standardization* and Interpretation of the ECG \\(*Kligfield et al. — JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). The stated goal of this consensus report was to reassess the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Among the many insightful conclusions arising out of this publication \\(*many of which are described in this Section 3*\\) — is that the term, “unipolar” should *no longer* be used.\n\n+ In the past — it was said that 3 of the 12 leads on a *standard* ECG were “bipolar” \\(= *leads I,II,III*\\) — and the *other* 9 leads \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF;* and *V1-thru-V6*\\) were “unipolar”. *No longer\\! *The ACC/AHA/HRS Consensus Report emphasized that*** all* leads are effectively “bipolar”.** \n+ In the past — derivation of the 3 *augmented* leads \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF*\\) was determined from the difference in electrical potential between the respective anatomic recording site *minus* a central null vector. This process is no longer used. Instead — all 12 leads now use a *derived* electrode to serve as the *opposing* electrode for any lead pair. \n+ ***Chest* leads** use Wilson’s central terminal as the opposing *derived* electrode \\(*Section 03.6*\\). In contrast — the 3 ***augmented* leads** \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF*\\) use the Goldberger central terminal. The central terminal *previously* used during the early days of electrocardiography was derived from the mean potential of RA, LA and LL electrodes. As a result — the amplitude of complexes recorded from these extremity leads was low because the potential from the recording site was part of the central terminal. Thus, the recording potential was partially *subtracted* from the total potential displayed on the ECG. By *removing* the potential of the lead being recorded from the central terminal — Goldberger was able to ***augment*** the **amplitude** of recording complexes ***by* 50%**. \n\n \n\nAbbreviations of Societies contributing to the Consensus Report:\n\n+ ACC — American College of Cardiology. \n+ AHA — American Heart Association. \n+ HRS — Heart Rhythm Society. \n\n \n\n**03.3 – Derivation of the *Standard* Limb Leads \\(*Leads I,II,III*\\)**\n\nAs stated — the ECG waveform in the **3 *standard* limb leads** is derived from the *electrical difference* between 2 of the standard limb lead electrodes. From **Figure 03.2-1** — it can therefore be seen that the electrical potential of standard **lead I** is a result of the **electrical *difference*** between the LA and RA recording electrodes. Since the electrical wavefront travels from negative to positive — ***positive* Lead I** is directed *toward* the left arm in a horizontal plane that corresponds to an angle of ***zero* degrees**. As we will see momentarily \\(*in Section 03.5*\\) — zero degrees is our ***starting *point** in the *Hexaxial* Lead System\n\n+ It follows \\(*from* Fig. 03.2-1\\) — that the electrical potential of standard** Lead II** is the *difference* between the LL and RA electrodes. \n+ **Lead III** — is derived from the *difference* between the LL and LA electrodes. \n\n \n\n\n\n***Reproduced* Figure 03.2-1:** Einthoven’s triangle. The ECG waveform for each of the 3 *standard* limb leads \\(*I,II,III*\\) is derived from the *difference* in electrical potential *between* 2 of the limb lead electrodes \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** The **4 *limb lead* electrodes** \\(*placed on the RA,LA,LL and RL extremities*\\) — serve to define the 6 frontal plane limb leads.\n\n+ The **RL** \\(*Right Leg*\\) **electrode** — serves as an electronic reference that helps attenuate unwanted noise \\(*interference*\\). This **RL electrode** \\(*which is not shown in* Fig. 03.2-1\\) — is *not* used in the derivation of any of the limb leads. \n+ This leaves **3 *pairs*** of **electrodes** to generate the ECG waveforms of the 6 limb leads. Within *each* pair — one electrode is established as the *positive* end of the lead — whereas the *other* electrode of the pair is deemed the *negative* end. For example \\(*as seen in* Figure 03.2-1\\) — **Lead I** is derived from the electrical difference between the LA *minus* the RA electrodes \\(LA-RA\\), whereby the LA electrode is *positive* and the RA electrode is *negative*. \n+ Since the sum of voltage gains and voltage drops within the *closed* circuit of the 3 standard limb leads is equal to zero \\(*according to* ***Einthoven’s*** Law\\) — the potential of **lead II =** the potential of** lead I \\+ lead III** at *any* instant of time in the cardiac cycle. \n+ ***KEY* Point:** Because the potential of Lead II = Lead I \\+ Lead III — *any* of the 3 *standard* limb leads can be mathematically derived from the *other* 2 leads. Therefore — the 3 standard limb leads contain *only* 2 independent pieces of information \\(*Kligfield et al. — JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). \n\n \n\n**03.4 – The 3 *Augmented* Leads \\(*Leads aVR,aVL,aVF*\\)**\n\nIn addition to the 3 *standard* limb leads \\(*I,II,III*\\) — there are 3 ***augmented* limb leads**. These are **Lead aVR** —** Lead aVL** — and** Lead aVF**. These 3 extremity leads record the difference in electrical potential between the respective extremity lead site and the Golderberger reference central terminal \\(*Section 03.2*\\). For practical purposes — the orientation for each of these **3 *augmented* leads** \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF*\\) can be thought of as an *outwardly* directed line extending from the electrical center of the heart to the particular electrode site on the right arm; left arm; or left leg \\(*outwardly directed ****red* arrows*** in* **Figure 03.4-1**\\).\n\n+ **NOTE:** As discussed in Section 03.2 — Leads aVR, aVL and aVF are known as the ***\"augmented\" *leads** \\(*which accounts for the little *“a”* preceding VR, VL and VF*\\). The reason for this “a” — is that these extremity leads normally produce a relatively *small* electrical potential. This smaller electrical potential is magnified \\(ie, *augmented*\\) by approximately 50% through use of the Goldberger central reference system. Doing so results in comparable *relative* size for the QRST complex in all 12 leads of a standard ECG. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.4-1:** Hexaxial lead system with lead orientation in number of degrees displayed for the 6 limb leads. Electrical orientation for the **3 standard *limb* leads** \\(*I,II,III*\\) — is depicted by *outwardly* directly *yellow* arrows at 0, \\+60 and \\+120 degrees. Orientation for the **3 *augmented* leads** \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF*\\) — is depicted by *outwardly* directly *red* arrows. **Lead aVR** — is in the upper right quadrant; **lead aVF** — is vertical at \\+90 degrees; **lead aVL** — is in the upper left quadrant at -30 degrees \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** As alluded to in Section 03.2 — the Goldberger central terminal is now used as the opposing electrode for each of the extremity leads instead of Wilson’s central terminal that was used in the past. The Goldberger central terminal is derived by dividing the sum of the electrical potential of the other 2 extremity leads by two. That is, for **lead aVR** — this value is \\(LA \\+ LL\\)/2; for **lead aVL** — it is \\(RA \\+ LL\\)/2; and for **lead aVF** — it is \\(RA \\+ LA\\)/2.\n\n+ ***KEY* Point:** It is *not* important to try to memorize these *hard-to-remember* relationships\\! ***What* IS important** — is to appreciate that the ECG waveform for *each* of the 3 *augmented* leads can be *derived* simply from knowing the ECG appearance of any 2 of the 3 standard limb leads\\! Thus, from a mathematical standpoint — there is ***much* redundancy** of information. Among the 12 standard leads that make up an ECG — there are *only* 8 independent pieces of information \\(*because 1 of the 3 standard limb leads *and* all 3 of the augmented leads are derived from the other 2 limb leads*\\)\\! \n+ ***BOTTOM *Line:** The AHA/ACC/HRS Consensus Report wants clinicians to recognize the *derived* and *redundant* nature of the 6 limb leads. Technically — only 2 leads are needed to reproduce all ECG waveforms in these 6 leads \\(*Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). That said — all 6 limb leads are retained because their use facilitates understanding and clinical interpretation \\(ie, *it would seem far more difficult and contrived to contemplate diagnosis of acute inferior MI from only seeing lead I and lead II *— *although this theoretically is possible*\\). \n\n \n\n**03.5 – The *Hexaxial* Lead System**\n\nFigure 03.4-1 puts together lead orientation for the **6 *limb* leads**. This composite makes up what is known as the ***“Hexaxial Lead System”***.\n\n+ **Lead I** — is a ***l****ateral *\\(***l****eftward*\\) monitoring lead that views the heart's electrical activity from a *horizontally *oriented vantage point defined as **0 degrees**. This is our ***starting *point** in the *Hexaxial* Lead System. \n+ In contrast to lead I — ***standard* Lead II** and **Lead III** are ***inferior *leads** that respectively view the heart's electrical activity from vantage points angulated at **\\+60** and **\\+120 degrees** relative to the heart's electrical center. \n+ **Lead aVL** — is another ***l****ateral *\\(***l****eftward*\\) monitoring lead \\(Figure 03.4-1\\). It records the heart's electrical activity from a vantage point that looks down at the heart from the patient's ***l****eft *shoulder \\(*from a position that corresponds to an angle of ****-30 degrees**** with respect to the heart's electrical center*\\). \n+ **Lead aVF** — is an *inferior *monitoring lead. The recording electrode is placed on the patient's *left* lower extremity — and the heart's electrical activity is viewed from a vantage point that looks directly up at the heart from the patient's ***f****eet*. This provides a *perpendicular *vantage point \\(*that corresponds to an angle of ****\\+90 degrees***\\). \n+ **Lead aVR** — is the last of the augmented leads. It is the most distant recording electrode. Lead aV**R** views the heart from afar — looking down from the patient's ***r****ight *shoulder. Because the heart sits in the left side of the chest — the heart’s electrical activity will generally be directed *away* from this *right-sided* and most distant recording electrode. As a result, for practical purposes — QRST morphology in lead aVR usually contributes *little* to interpretation of most tracings \\(*with notable exception when there is lead misplacement or dextrocardia*\\). **PEARL:** There *are* some additional important clinical situations in which lead aVR may provide *invaluable* information to assist our interpretation \\(*We cover this concept in detail in Sections 09.31thru-through 09.40 devoted to How to Use Lead aVR*\\). \n\n \n\n**03.6 – *Precordial* Lead Placement**\n\nIn addition to 3 limb and 3 *augmented* leads — **6 *more* leads** are routinely included in a ***standard *12-lead ECG**. These are the **precordial *chest* leads** — which view the heart’s electrical activity in the ***transverse*** \\(*horizontal*\\)** plane**. These 6 precordial leads are positioned according to ***anatomic* landmarks** \\(Figure 03.6-1\\). As opposed to the 3 *augmented* limb leads \\(*aVR,aVL,aVF*\\) which are connected within a *closed* electrical loop — the 6 precordial* chest *leads are *independent* of each other \\(ie, *they are based on electrical activity assessed from their specific recording site — *and* cannot be derived from other electrodes as the 6 limb leads can*\\).\n\n+ The electrical recording from each chest lead is derived from the *difference* in potential between the respective anatomic recording site and a reference central terminal. For the chest leads — the central terminal used is the one first derived by Wilson in the 1930s. This central terminal is equal to mean potential from the RA, LA and LL electrodes \\(*roughly corresponding to the center of Einthoven’s equilateral triangle*\\). \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** Each of the 6 precordial \\(*chest*\\) leads provides *independent* information based on electrical activity recorded from its respective anatomic site \\(*as shown in* Figure 03.6-1\\) — minus the potential from a central reference terminal. Clinically — the viewpoint of each *precordial* lead on a 12-lead tracing correlates with the anatomic area of the heart that lies below it. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.6-1:** Anatomic landmarks for *precordial* lead placement \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**03.7 – Use of *Additional* Leads**\n\n*Most* of the time — the 12 viewpoints provided by a ***standard* 12-lead ECG** convey adequate information to *appropriately* evaluate and manage the patient. That said — there *are* occasions when use of ***additional* leads** may be helpful. Most commonly, these *extra* viewpoints include one or more *right-sided* leads \\(*especially ***lead V4R**\\) — and/or use of *posterior* leads \\(*V7,****V8****,****V9****,V10*\\).\n\n+ The goal of considering ***additional* leads** is to facilitate recognition of acute RV \\(*Right Ventricular*\\) and/or *posterior* infarction. This objective has resulted in preference by some for a **15-lead ECG** \\(*addition of V4R, V8, V9 to the standard 12 leads*\\). \n+ **Lead V4R**: — same placement as lead V4, but on the *right* chest. \n+ **Lead V8:** — placed in the back at the tip of the left scapula at the *same* horizontal level of lead V6. \n+ **Lead V9:** — placed in the back in the left paraspinal area in between the scapula and posterior spine, level with V6. \n\n \n\n***Our* Bias:** We prefer to ***start*** with **12 leads**. *Most* of the time — 12 leads are *all* that are needed to determine optimal *initial* management. That said — it is good to be aware of those situations for which use of *additional* leads may be helpful \\(*We return to this concept in Section 10.31 on acute RV MI *— *and in Section 10.36 on diagnosis of posterior MI*\\).\n\n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** — Opinions vary regarding need for 12 vs 15 leads. Clearly, a balance must be struck between *urgency* of the situation — *How Long* it will take to obtain additional leads — and whether this time is really worth what you’ll *actually* learn from getting more leads. \n\n \n\n**03.8 –* Technical* Errors: *Angle of Louis and Lead V1***\n\nAccurate placement of ***precordial* leads** on the chest is essential. Placing a *precordial* lead as little as one IC \\(*Intercostal Space*\\) either too high or too low can dramatically alter QRS morphology and amplitude.\n\n+ The *KEY* to determining ***correct *placement** of precordial leads is to first identify the ***Angle of Louis***. This can be done by lowering your finger from the ***manubrial *notch** \\(*in the midline at the upper edge border of the sternum*\\) — until it comes to lie on a small ***horizontal *ridge**. The **2nd *intercostal *space** lies just *below* this point \\(**Figure 03.8-1**\\). \n+ Drop down 2 additional intercostal spaces \\(*to the* ***4th intercostal* space**\\) — and move *just to the right* of the sternum to locate the reference position for **Lead V1 \\(**Figure 03.6-1 *and* Figure 03.8-1**\\)**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.8-1:** Anatomic landmarks \\(*Angle of Louis*\\).\n\n+ ***Clinical* NOTE:** Amazingly — ***inaccurate* placement** of **lead V1** remains one of the most common technical errors committed. From description of *precordial* lead placement in Figure 03.6-1 — it should be obvious that IF the *wrong* intercostal space is used for placement of lead V1 — that *all* precordial leads will be inaccurately placed\\! \n\n \n\n**03.9 –* Technical* Mishaps: *Important Caveats***\n\nBe aware of the following caveats:\n\n+ In ***women ***— recording electrodes should be placed *under* the left breast to avoid precordial lead placement errors. This is especially problematic in women with large breasts. That said — consensus is lacking as to optimal electrode placement in women because of inconsistent literature results on the effect lead placement has on ECG waveforms. The amount of voltage attenuation by breast tissue appears to be variable — and reproducibility of precordial lead placement is often precarious, depending on experience of the technician; breast size, shape and adiposity; and small changes in patient position. ***BOTTOM* Line:** The AHA/ACC/HRS Consensus Statement still recommends electrodes be placed *under* the breast at this time — but this recommendation may change pending additional study \\(*Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). Until that time — the *KEY* is *consistency* of lead placement in any given patient\\! \n+ **Lead V5** *and* **lead V6** should both be placed ***level with* lead V4**. This is *preferred* to the 5th intercostal space, which was the *previously* recommended reference point \\(*Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). The reason for recommending placement of leads V5 and V6 at the same horizontal level as lead V4 — is that the course of each intercostal space is variable. \n+ Definition of **lead V5** as ***midway between* V4** and **V6** is a *more reproducible* landmark than the anterior axillary line — especially in cases when body habitus precludes accurate identification of the anterior axillary line \\(*Kligfield et al. — AHA/ACC Recs. JACC 49:1109-1127, 2007*\\). \n+ ***Chest wall abnormalities ***— are a common source of placement errors. These include pectus excavatum or carinatum \\(*hollow or pigeon breast*\\) — severe emphysema — and large body habitus, among others. Making a small mark on the chest where the leads were placed will hopefully clarify lead placement and promote consistency with *serial* tracings. \n+ ***Is the Bed Flat? ***— Often overlooked is the effect that ***inclination*** of the **bed** may have on the 12-lead ECG recording. Patients with ***acute *dyspnea** \\(*as is common with acute heart failure, COPD, pulmonary embolism*\\) — may simply *not* be able to lie flat when first seen. Inclination of the bed by 20-30 degrees may *either* “produce” Q waves or make Q waves disappear \\(*especially in the limb leads*\\). Be sure to note the *angle* of the bed when the ECG is recorded if it is not flat. This will hopefully resolve the problem of *inferior *Q waves “coming and going” as the patient gets better or worse. \n+ ***Comparing Serial Tracings ***— Remember to take into account the effect that a *change* in axis or precordial lead placement may have on the QRS and on ST-T waves. IF the mean QRS axis has *changed* between one tracing and the next — then the reason for a new Q wave seen on a subsequent tracing may be the *change* in axis \\(*and not necessarily the result of infarction*\\). Similarly — a change in precordial lead placement may dramatically alter QRS amplitude and morphology. The task of determining whether differences are due to a true ECG change vs axis shift/placement may be challenging\\! \n+ ***Arm *Leads **— should ideally be placed between shoulders and the wrists, away from bony prominences. ***Leg* Leads** — should be placed between hips and ankles, away from bony areas. IF for whatever reason more proximal lead placement \\(*of limb leads on the trunk*\\) is used — this should be noted on the tracing. *Consistency is key*. \n\n \n\n**03.10 –* Important* Concepts: *Lead Misplacement/Dextrocardia***\n\nAlthough we include technical mishaps discussed in this Section 03 at an *early* point in this ECG ePub — many of these concepts are advanced. You’ll want to return to this section often …\n\n**QUESTIONS on *KEY* Concepts:**\n\n+ What might be wrong *technically* in **Panel A** and **Panel B** of Figure 03.10-1? \n+ How could you verify the cause for the *unexpected* appearance in each case? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.10-1:** Which technical mishaps do you suspect? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Panel A in Figure 03.10-1:** The most common error in lead placement is mixing up left and right arm electrodes. Suspect this \\(*or dextrocardia*\\) — IF there is: i\\) ***global *negativity** in **lead I** \\(*negative P, QRS and T wave*\\); ii\\) an *upright* QRS complex in **lead aVR** — and iii\\) a *negative *P wave in **lead II**. All 3 of these findings are present in Panel A:\n\n+ Normally — the **QRS** in *left-sided ***Lead I** will be ***upright*** \\(*assuming the heart lies in the left side of the thorax*\\). Lateral infarction may produce a Q in lead I — but usually there is *at least some* R wave. **You should *never* see *“global negativity”* in lead I** \\(*unless there is dextrocardia *or* lead reversal*\\). \n+ **Lead aVR** — should normally show a ***negative *QRS** complex. The heart’s electrical activity normally moves toward the *left* — or *away* from *right-sided* lead aVR. About the *only* time you won’t see global negativity in lead aVR — is with *marked* RVH \\(*unless there is dextrocardia *or* lead reversal*\\). \n+ **Lead II** — should *always* show an ***upright* P wave** IF the rhythm is sinus. The path of electrical activity from the SA Node to the AV Node is virtually parallel to the \\+60 degree angle of lead II \\(*Section 02.3*\\). Therefore — IF the P wave in lead II is *not* upright — then the rhythm is *not* sinus \\(*unless there is dextrocardia *or* lead reversal*\\). \n\n \n\n**Panel B:** We *reproduce* Panel B from Figure 03.10-1 below in **Figure 03.10-2**. Which technical mishap do you suspect? *Explain* your answer.\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.10-2:** Which technical mishap do you suspect from the schematic *precordial* lead sequence shown here? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 03.10-2:** Lead V2 in the *precordial* lead sequence in Panel B simply does *not* make sense. There is not only *loss* of r wave from lead V1 to V2 — but an *upright* T wave is also seen between negative T waves in *neighboring* leads V1 and V3. *Suspect an error in precordial lead placement\\!*\n\n+ ***Key* Point:*** Unusual* R wave progression \\(ie, *abrupt transition; sudden loss or gain of R wave that only lasts for a single lead*\\) — should suggest precordial lead misplacement. IF ever in doubt — ***Repeat the ECG\\!*** \n\n \n\n**03.11 – Dextrocardia:* ECG Recognition ***\n\nDextrocardia is rare — but it *does* occur. The average clinician will see *no more *than a handful of cases in his/her lifetime. Dextrocardia typically produces the ***same *ECG picture** in the limb leads as *right-to-left* arm lead reversal. That is — ***lead I looks like aVR should look ***\\(*there is global negativity*\\) — and lead aVR looks like lead I should look with a positive QRS complex \\(**Panel A*** in *Figure 03.11-1\\).\n\n**QUESTION on *Recognizing* Dextrocardia:**\n\n+ IF the limb leads in **Panel A** of Figure 03.11-1 were the result of **dextrocardia** — Would you expect the *precordial* lead sequence to look more like Panel C or Panel D? \n+ Which *precordial* lead sequence would you expect IF the limb leads were the result of ***limb lead* reversal**? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.11-1:** Limb lead appearance in **Panel A** is consistent with *either* limb lead reversal or dextrocardia. Which *precordial* lead sequence \\(**C** *or* **D**\\) would you expect if the patient had dextrocardia?\n\n**Answer to Figure 03.11-1:** Panel C in Fig. 03.11-1 shows *normal* R wave progression in the *precordial* leads. Note gradual \\(*progressive*\\) increase in R wave amplitude as one moves from lead V1-*toward*-V4 with — transition \\(*where the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep*\\) occurring at normal location *between* V3-to-V4 \\(*Section 09.5*\\).\n\n+ IF the *limb* leads shown in **Panel A** were accompanied by the *precordial* lead sequence in **Panel C** — this would suggest simple ***lead* reversal** \\(*because R wave progression is normal as expected when the heart lies in the left hemithorax*\\). \n+ On the other hand — We would suspect ***Dextrocardia*** IF the *limb* leads in **Panel A** were accompanied by the *precordial* lead sequence in **Panel D** — because ***reverse* R wave progression** is seen. That is, the R wave is *tallest* in lead V1 of Panel D — and becomes progressively *smaller* as one moves across the *left* precordium. This is as one would expect IF the heart was in the *right* hemithorax. \n+ ***Confirmation*** of **Dextrocardia** is easy: **i\\)** Listen to the heart \\(*heart sounds will be heard on the right*\\); **ii\\)** Chest X-Ray will show a *right-sided *heart shadow; and/or **iii\\)** Repeat the ECG with precordial leads placed on the right — and you will now see *normal* R wave progression. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:*** **There are many potential variations of dextrocardia, each with its own particular characteristics. Thus, the heart may lie on the right — but the atria and ventricles may be arranged normally \\(*dextroversion*\\). Alternatively — the heart may be a *mirror* image of normal, with the atria and ventricles reversed. The great vessels and other visceral organs may or may not be reversed. The **P wave** in **lead II** may or may not be negative —depending on the nature of associated anatomic abnormalities. *Regardless* of P wave appearance in lead II — a form of dextrocardia should be suspected IF *ever* you see **global *negativity* in lead I** *with* **QRS positivity in lead aVR**. Confirmation can then be forthcoming by: **i\\)** listening on the right for heart sounds; **ii\\)** Chest x-ray; *and/or* **iii\\)** Repeating the ECG with precordial leads placed on the right \\(*which will now show normal R wave progression*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.12 – PRACTICE: *Identifying Technical Errors***\n\n\n\nConsider the following series of tracings \\(*Sections 03.13-thru-03.23*\\). In each case — Identify the likely technical mishap. *Our answers follow after each tracing.*\n\n+ ***Be Aware: *** — An example of dextrocardia is included. \n\n \n\n**Acknowledgements:** My appreciation to the following people for allowing me to use their tracings that appear in the following Figures:\n\n+ David Richley \\(*of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK*\\) — Figures 03.16-1; 03.16-2; 03.17-1; 03.18-1; 03.21-1. \n+ Dawn Altman \\(*of the ECG Guru*\\) — Figures 03.19-1; 03.19-2. \n+ Jenda Enis Stros \\(*of Liberec, CzechRepublic*\\) — Figures 03.20-1; 03.22-1. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.13 – PRACTICE: *Tracing A***\n\nThe rhythm in Tracing A was diagnosed as atrial flutter. *Do you agree?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.13-1:** Practice Tracing A.\n\n**Answer to Tracing A:** At first glance — it *looks like* there are flutter waves in lead II, as well as in several other leads on this tracing. That said — the rhythm is ***not* AFlutter** because: **i\\)** The undulations we see in lead II and elsewhere are *not* nearly regular enough to represent the 300/minute consistent *“sawtooth”* pattern of atrial flutter; and **ii\\)** We can see regular underlying P waves \\(*red arrows in* **Figure 03.13-2**\\).\n\n+ Note that the P waves highlighted by *red arrows* in Figure 03.13-2 are *unaffected* by the baseline artifact\\! \n+ Clinically — one look at the patient *confirmed* that the baseline activity was artifact from a marked *resting* tremor. **PEARL:** Be aware that the rate of a **Parkinsonian *resting* tremor** is often close to the rate of AFlutter. \n+ NOTE: We have already seen the lead II rhythm strip from this patient \\(*Section 02.25*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.13-2:** *Arrows* have been added to Figure 03.13-1 to highlight *underlying* sinus P waves. Baseline undulations are artifact from tremor.\n\n\n\n\n\n**03.14 – PRACTICE: *Tracing B***\n\nBeats \\#6 and \\#7 were diagnosed as a ventricular couplet \\(*2 PVCs in a row*\\) — followed by 2 more PVCs \\(*beats \\#10,12*\\) later on in the tracing. *Do you agree?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.14-1:** Practice Tracing B.\n\n**Answer to Tracing B:** At first glance — it looks like there are *multiple* PVCs on this tracing. This is especially true for beat \\#6 — which is wide and perfectly placed where one might expect a PVC to occur. That said — we *know* that there are ***no* PVCs** on this tracing. Instead there is **artifact**. We say this because:\n\n+ There are baseline undulations seen throughout the tracing — especially during the last half of the tracing. Recognition that these coarse short vertical irregularities represent artifact should heighten awareness that other unexpected undulations might also represent artifact. \n+ The ***timing*** of **beat \\#7** is ***impossible*** for this beat to be a real. IF beat \\#7 was a PVC — there is *no way* that beat \\#8 could conduct \\(*since it would doubtlessly fall within the absolute refractory period of beat \\#7*\\). Knowing beat \\#7 is the result of **artifact** tells us that other *similar-looking* deflections \\(ie, \\#6,10,12\\) must *also* be artifact. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.15 – PRACTICE: *Tracing C***\n\nThe rhythm in Tracing C was diagnosed as atrial flutter. *Do you agree?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.15-1:** Practice Tracing C. \\(NOTE: **Lead MCL-1*** is a right-sided monitoring lead that provides similar perspective as lead V1 on a 12-lead tracing*\\).\n\n**Answer to Tracing C:** As was the case for Tracing A \\(Figure 03.13-1\\) — the rhythm in Tracing C *initially* looks like AFlutter. That said — this rhythm is *unlikely* to be AFlutter because:\n\n+ A true sawtooth pattern is absent. Instead we see *irregularly* occurring short vertical spikes at a rate significantly *greater* than 300/minute. This strongly suggests that these short vertical spikes represent **artifact**. \n+ NOTE: We are *not* at all certain what the rhythm in Figure 03.15-1 is. A **12-lead ECG** would be needed to comment further — as this will reveal IF flutter or other atrial activity is seen in other leads. What *can* be said from **Tracing C** in Fig. 03.15-1 is the following: **i\\)** The rhythm looks to be supraventricular \\(*narrow QRS in this MCL-1 lead*\\); **ii\\)** The rhythm is almost but *not* completely regular \\(*slight but definite variation in R-R intervals of some beats when measured with calipers*\\); **iii\\)** No definite P waves are seen \\(*although we can’t be sure if atrial activity is or is not present elsewhere without a 12-lead tracing*\\); and **iv\\) Artifact** appears to be present. *Pending* results of a 12-lead ECG — We *suspect* the rhythm is ***probably* AFib** \\(*Atrial Fibrillation*\\) given *lack* of P waves and *slight-but-definite* irregularity in the rhythm. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.16 – PRACTICE: *Tracing D***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.16-1:** Practice Tracing D.\n\n**Answer to Tracing D:** There is ***global* negativity** in **lead I** \\(*of the P wave, QRS and T wave*\\). This should virtually *never* occur normally. The most likely causes of global negativity in lead I are: **i\\)** LA-RA \\(*Left Arm-Right-Arm*\\) lead reversal; and **ii\\)** Dextrocardia \\(*Sections 03.10 and 03.11*\\).\n\n+ In addition to *global* negativity in lead I — Note that the P wave, QRS complex and T wave in **lead aVR** are *not* negative as they usually are under normal circumstances. This is consistent with *either* lead reversal or dextrocardia. \n+ **R wave progression** is ***normal*** in Tracing D \\(*with transition occurring between lead V3-to-V4*\\). This defines the problem as ***limb lead *reversal** and *not* dextrocardia \\(*Section 03.11*\\). \n+ The diagnosis of **LA-RA *limb lead* reversal** was *confirmed* by ***repeating*** the **ECG** *after* verifying correct limb lead placement \\(**Figure 03.16-2**\\). Note in Fig. 03.16-2 that the P wave, QRS and T wave in lead I are now all upright — and that there is now global negativity in lead aVR as is normally expected. \n+ ***Clinical* Note:** The P wave in **lead II** will often \\(*but not always*\\) be negative when there is *either* lead reversal *or* dextrocardia. That said — the P wave in lead II of Figure 03.16-1 is *upright* despite limb lead reversal. The P wave is even more upright with correct lead placement \\(Figure 03.16-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.16-2:** The **ECG** from Figure 03.16-1 has been ***repeated***. Note that the P, QRS and T wave in **lead I** are now positive — and that global *negativity* has been restored in **lead aVR**. R wave progression is normal and unchanged from Fig. 03.16-1. This confirms that the unusual picture initially seen in **Figure 03.16-1** was due to **LA-RA *limb lead* reversal** \\(*and not dextrocardia*\\).\n\n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to David Richley \\(*of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK*\\) for allowing me to use these tracings. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.16.1 – ADDENDUM: *Prevalence/Types *of Limb Lead Errors**\n\nThere are *many* possible ways to misconnect the 4 limb lead electrodes. Of the *estimated* 300 million ECGs obtained annually worldwide — as many as 6 million ECGs \\(~*2% of the total*\\) are thought to manifest *some* technical mishap \\(*Rowlands DJ: J Electrocardiology 41:84-90, 2008*\\). Awareness of how to recognize technical mishaps when they occur is therefore essential\\!\n\n+ There are 6 ways to commit a *single* limb lead misconnection \\(*RA-LA; RA-RL; RA-LL; LA-RL; LA-LL; and RL-LL*\\). The number of possible errors increases if *multiple* lead mix-ups are included among the possibilities. Recall of the specific ECG pattern likely to be seen by each of these technical mishaps is challenging even for the advanced interpreter. Fortunately — it is *not* necessary to recall each particular ECG pattern *as long as* you recognize that one or more leads are misconnected. \n+ **NOTE-1:** The most common form of lead misconnection is the easiest to recognize. This is **LA-RA** \\(*Left Arm-Right Arm*\\) ***limb lead* reversal** — in which the ECG waveform in lead I looks like aVR, and vice versa \\(*Sections 03.10, 03.11 *— *and* Figure 03.16-1\\). \n+ **NOTE-2:** Lead misconnections as well as anatomic errors in placement may also occur in precordial leads. We address ***precordial* lead errors** later in this section \\(*Sections 03.20-thru-03.23*\\). \n\n \n\n**03.16.2 – ECG Findings that *Suggest* Limb Lead Misconnection**\n\nAs stated — limb lead reversal is surprisingly common. Its occasional occurrence is an almost *inevitable* consequence of the quantity of ECGs that are ordered. Clinically — A ***possible* limb lead misconnection** should be *suspected* IF *any* of the following findings are present:\n\n+ ***Global* negativity** in **lead I**. \n+ A predominantly ***positive* QRS** complex in **lead aVR**. \n+ A ***negative* P wave** in **lead II**. \n+ A ***null* vector** \\(*completely flat line*\\) in *any* of the limb leads. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** It is prudent to suspect *possible* lead misplacement on recognition of *any* of the above findings. The “good news” — is that it is usually *easy* to check out IF your suspicion is accurate: Simply ***repeat the ECG*** to see if the abnormal finding goes away.\n\n+ Apply these concepts to the ECG examples we show in Sections 03.17-thru-03.19. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.17 – PRACTICE: *Tracing E***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.17-1:** Practice Tracing E.\n\n**Answer to Tracing E:** A ***null* vector** \\(*totally flat line*\\) is seen in **lead III**. This should virtually *never* occur normally. The most likely cause of a null vector in lead III, but an otherwise fairly normal tracing — is **LA-RL** \\(*Left Arm-Right Leg*\\) ***limb lead* reversal**.\n\n+ As emphasized in the beginning of this Section \\(*in* Figure 03.1-1\\) — the **RL** \\(*Right Leg*\\) **electrode** serves as a *zero* electrical potential \\(*ground lead*\\) reference point. \n+ Lead misconnections involving the RL electrode typically produce a *predictable* ECG pattern. With **LA-RL lead reversal** — Leads I and II look the same; leads aVL and aVF look the same — and **lead III** records a ***null* vector**. This is *precisely* the pattern we see in **Figure 03.17-1**. Note that *precordial* lead R wave progression in Fig. 03.17-1 is normal \\(*with transition occurring between V3-to-V4*\\). \n+ IF on the other hand, there was **RA-RL lead reversal** — Leads I and aVL will look the same \\(*with a negative QRS*\\); leads aVR and aVF look the same \\(*with a positive QRS*\\) — and it will be **lead II** that records a ***null* vector** \\(Figure 03.18-1\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** Many “brain cells” are required to commit the expected *specific* ECG patterns of LA-RL and RA-RL lead reversal to memory. This is *not* needed clinically — because ***all that counts is recognition that some type of lead misconnection is possible***. Awareness of the 4 *easy-to-remember* ECG findings cited in Section 03.16.2 should be all that is needed to recognize most clinically significant lead misconnections. Look for one or more of the following: **i\\)** *Global* negativity in lead I; **ii\\)** A predominantly *positive* QRS complex in lead aVR; **iii\\)** A *negative* P wave in lead II; *and/or* **iv\\)** A *null* vector \\(*completely flat line*\\) in *any* of the limb leads.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The electrical potential recorded from the **RL** electrode is virtually *identical* to that recorded from the **LL** electrode \\(*zero in each case*\\). As a result — ***RL-LL* misconnection** does *not* change the relationships in Einthoven’s triangle — because *both* RL and LL electrodes record a similar *zero* electrical potential. This means you will *not* be able to recognize RL-LL misconnection based on ECG appearance. That said — this does* not* matter, because the 12-lead ECG will be essentially *unchanged* if RL and LL electrodes are inadvertently misconnected. \n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to David Richley \\(*of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK*\\) for allowing me to use this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.18 – PRACTICE: *Tracing F***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.18-1:** Practice Tracing F.\n\n**Answer to Tracing F:** A ***null* vector** \\(*totally flat line*\\) is seen in **lead II**. This should virtually *never* occur normally. The most likely cause of a null vector in lead II — is **RA-RL** \\(*Right Arm-Right Leg*\\) ***limb lead* reversal**.\n\n+ In Section 03.17 — We discussed the ECG pattern expected with LA-RL lead reversal \\(Tracing E = Figure 03.17-1\\). In this case — the overall ECG looks relatively normal with exception of a null *vector* in lead III. \n+ In contrast — the ***null* vector** in **Figure 03.18-1** is seen in **lead II**. This suggests that the misconnection is the result of **RA-RL lead reversal**. Other features of RA-RL misconnection are that: **i\\)** Leads I and aVL look the same \\(*and manifest a negative QRS*\\); and **ii\\)** leads aVR and aVF look the same \\(*and manifest a positive QRS*\\). Note that *precordial* lead R wave progression in Fig. 03.18-1 is normal \\(*with transition occurring between V3-to-V4*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** Once again — recall of the specific features that distinguish RA-RL lead reversal from other limb lead misconnections is far *less* important than recognizing ***that some type of lead misconnection is likely***. Recognition of a technical mishap is *easy* for the ECG shown in Figure 03.18-1 because: **i\\)** there is global *negativity* in lead I; **ii\\)** lead aVR is positive; and **iii\\)** there is a *null* vector in one of the limb leads \\(*seen here in lead II*\\).\n\n+ ***Confirmation*** that limb lead reversal is the cause of the ECG picture in Figure 03.18-1 — is *readily* attained by *verifying* lead placement and ***repeating the* ECG**. The *abnormal* findings in Fig. 03.18-1 \\(*null vector in lead II; global negativity in lead I; positive R wave in aVR*\\) — should *no longer* be seen once an ECG with *correct* lead placement is obtained. \n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to David Richley \\(*of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK*\\) for allowing me to use this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.19 – PRACTICE: *Tracing G***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.19-1:** Practice Tracing G.\n\n**Answer to Tracing G:** There are several distinctly ***unusual* findings** on the 12-lead ECG seen in Figure 03.19-1. These include:\n\n+ Very ***negative* P wave** with ***deep* Q wave** in **lead I**. This is *not* the obvious global negativity appearance that we have previously seen in Figure 03.16-1 and Figure 03.18-1 — in which we *knew* something was “wrong”. But — the P wave in *left-sided* lead I is usually *not* decidedly negative when the P wave is positive in lead II as it is here. In addition — the Q wave in lead I is clearly *too deep* to be a normal “septal” q wave. While possible the Q waves in leads I and aVL represent prior high lateral infarction — the *possibility* of a ***technical* mishap** should be considered. \n+ *Both* the P wave and QRS complex in **lead aVR** are positive. This *shouldn’t* normally be if all leads are correctly placed *unless* there is marked underlying structural abnormality. \n\n \n\n**Impression of Figure 03.19-1:** In addition to the *unusual* appearance of leads I and aVR — overall QRS amplitude in Fig. 03.19-1 is greatly reduced \\(*with the largest QRS complex surprisingly being recorded in lead V1*\\) — there is marked frontal plane axis deviation — and precordial R wave progression is reversed. ***Bottom* Line:** Something is *very wrong* here.\n\n+ Our first reaction to seeing the ECG in Figure 03.19-1 — is to find out more about the patient. *Are there symptoms?* Any history of heart disease or prior infarction? \n+ Is there a *prior* ECG? \n+ What does physical examination show? Are heart sounds heard on the *left* side of the chest? \n+ Is there a chest x-ray? \n+ What does a ***repeat* ECG** look like after verifying that all leads are correctly placed? \n\n \n\n***Follow-Up* to the Case:** Heart sounds were heard on the *right* side of the chest. The ECG was repeated with *precordial* leads placed on the *right* \\(**Panel B** *in* **Figure 03.19-2**\\). The patient had ***dextrocardia***.\n\n+ As discussed in Sections 03.10 and 03.11 — there are *many* potential forms of dextrocardia. The common “theme” on ECG — is that the appearance of leads I and aVR is *reversed* with dextrocardia from what you would normally expect. This is indeed the case in Figure 03.19-1. \n+ It is easy to ***confirm* dextrocardia** \\(*Section 03.11*\\):** i\\)** Heart sounds are heard on the right; **ii\\)** Chest x-ray shows a *right-sided* heart shadow; and **iii\\) *Repeat* ECG** with precordial leads placed on the right at least partially *normalizes* R wave progression. While admittedly, R wave progression in **Panel B** of Figure 03.19-2 is not “normal” \\(*since a predominant R wave is never seen*\\) — *right-sided* placement of precordial leads clearly results in an *increase* in positive forces, as would be expected if the heart was situated on the *right* side of the chest. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.19-2:** Comparison between the *original* precordial lead sequence seen in Figure 03.19-1 \\(**Panel A**\\) — with the precordial lead sequence on ***repeat* ECG** with precordial leads now placed in comparable anatomic location, but on the *right* side of the chest \\(**Panel B**\\). Note that while a predominant R wave is never attained in Panel B — there is nevertheless a decided *increase* in positive QRS amplitude that supports the diagnosis of **dextrocardia**.\n\n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to Dawn Altman \\(*of the ECG Guru*\\) for allowing me to use these tracings. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.20 – PRACTICE: *Tracing H***\n\nBeat \\#5 was interpreted as either a PVC or an *aberrantly* conducted PAC. *Do you agree?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.20-1:** Practice Tracing H.\n\n**Answer to Tracing H:** At first glance — **beat \\#5** looks like a legitimate early beat, especially in leads I, II and aVR. That said — beat \\#5 is *not* “real”. Instead, it is **artifact**. We *know* this because:\n\n+ Beat \\#5 *lacks* a T wave. \n+ There is absolutely *no effect* of the waveform labeled \\#5 on the underlying rhythm that continues *undisturbed* at the same R-R interval. \n+ The waveform labeled \\#5 *looks like* artifact. \n+ There is evidence *elsewhere* on this tracing of similar artifactual distortion. Note the small geometric spike in the T wave of beat \\#1 in leads II and aVR — as well as a similar small spike artifact occurring just past the midpoint of the R-R interval between beats \\#3-to-4 in leads I, II and aVR. \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** The deflection labeled \\#5 in Figure 03.20-1 is not real. We can dismiss it as **artifact** *without* need for further attention.\n\n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to Jenda Enis Stros \\(*of Liberec, CzechRepublic*\\) for allowing me to use this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.21 – PRACTICE: *Tracing I***\n\nThe *precordial* lead sequence seen in **Panel A** and **Panel B** of Figure 03.21-1 was obtained *moments apart *from the *same* patient.\n\n+ Can you guess what changed from one tracing to the next? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 03.21-1:** Practice Tracing I.\n\n**Answer to Tracing I:** The *precordial* lead sequence in **Panel A** was obtained with **incorrect *high* placement** of several ***chest lead* electrodes**. The effect this may have on the ECG recording is obvious when compared to the ***repeat* ECG** performed on this patient a short while later with *verified* correct lead placement \\(**Panel B**\\).\n\n+ Note *loss* in amplitude of the *initial* r wave in leads V1 and V2 when chest leads are placed too high \\(**Panel A**\\). In addition — an rSr’ \\(*incomplete RBBB*\\) pattern with T wave inversion was seen in *both* leads V1,V2 in Panel A — but is *no longer* seen in **Panel B** when the ECG is repeated with *correct* chest lead placement. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Note:** The importance of correct chest lead placement *cannot* be overstated \\(*Sections 03.6 and 03.7*\\). Erroneous placement of lead V1 at a location that is 1 or 2 interspaces *too* high — will result in erroneous placement of the remaining 5 precordial leads. Potential consequences include:\n\n+ Misinterpretation of LAA \\(*Left Atrial Abnormality*\\) — since inadvertent high chest lead placement may result in *deepening* of the negative component of the P wave in lead V1. \n+ *Inaccurate* diagnosis of incomplete RBBB with associated ST-T wave abnormality \\(**Panel A** *in* Fig. 03.21-1\\). This could result in confusion with Brugada syndrome variants that are really *not* present \\(Section 05.X**XXX**\\) \n+ *Inaccurate *interpretation of R wave progression in the precordial leads — leading to overcall or undercall of prior anteroseptal infarction. \n+ *Inaccurate *representation of true precordial lead amplitude \\(*leading to inaccurate diagnosis of LVH*\\). \n+ *False *impression that there has been a “change” in ECG appearance when *either* the prior tracing\\(s\\) or current tracing was *unknowingly* obtained with inaccurate chest lead placement. \n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to David Richley \\(*of Scarborough in North Yorkshire, UK*\\) for allowing me to use this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.22 – PRACTICE: *Tracing J***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.22-1:** Practice Tracing J.\n\n**Answer to Tracing J:** The precordial lead appearance of **lead V2** makes *no* sense:\n\n+ The initial small r wave that was seen in lead V1 has been lost. Instead — there is now a *small-but-definite* Q wave in **lead V2**. This is associated with a *disproportionately* tall R wave as well as some ST segment elevation. \n+ Equally *abrupt* change in QRST appearance between leads V2-to-V3 *as was seen* between leads V1-to-V2. \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** *Something just looks wrong*. The solution is easy: ***Repeat the ECG****,*** **being sure to *verify* correct precordial lead placement. Only in this way can we determine IF the ST elevation seen in lead V2 of Figure 03.22-1 is likely to be real and of concern, or a consequence of inaccurate chest lead placement.\n\n+ Acknowledgement: My appreciation to Jenda Enis Stros \\(*of Liberec, CzechRepublic*\\) for allowing me to use this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**03.23 – PRACTICE: *Tracing K***\n\nWhat *might* be wrong?\n\n\n\n**Figure 03.23-1:** Practice Tracing K.\n\n**Answer to Tracing K:** While overall the ECG in Figure 03.23 appears to be fairly unremarkable — **lead V6** simply does *not* make sense.\n\n+ We interpret the ECG in Fig. 03.23-1 as showing normal sinus rhythm; normal intervals and axis; no chamber enlargement; no more than a tiny q wave in lead III; normal R wave progression \\(*with transition between leads V3-to-V4*\\) — and some baseline artifact \\(*especially in lead V5*\\) but *no* acute ST-T wave changes. That said — it does not make sense for the S wave that disappeared after lead V4 to abruptly reappear with a predominant S\u003eR wave in lead V6. Instead — it would make much more sense if the waveform currently seen in lead V6 was recorded in lead V4 \\(*with the current V4 and V5 recordings being instead from V5 and V6*\\). \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** Simply ***repeating the ECG ***after verifying chest lead placement is an *easy* way to know for certain what the *true* precordial lead ECG appearance in **Tracing K** should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n**04.0 – Intervals \\(PR/QRS/QT\\)**\n\n\n\n**04.1 – What are the 3 Intervals in ECG Interpretation?**\n\nAs per the ***Systematic* Approach** introduced in Section 01.1 — *after* assessing a 12-lead ECG for Rate *and* Rhythm — one then looks to determine the **3 ECG Intervals** \\(Figure 04.1-1\\):\n\n+ The ***PR *interval** — is defined as the period that extends from the *onset* of *atrial* depolarization \\(*beginning of the P wave*\\) — until the onset of *ventricular* depolarization \\(*beginning of the QRS complex*\\). \n+ The ***QRS* complex** itself \\(*discussed more in Section 05.1*\\). \n+ The ***QT* interval** — the period from the onset of the QRS complex *until* the end of the T wave \\(*See Section 06.1*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 04.1-1:** The 3 **ECG Intervals** \\(*= the PR – QRS – QT intervals*\\). Measure intervals in the lead where the interval looks *longest*. Precise determination of an interval is usually *not* necessary if it falls within the normal range.\n\n**04.2 – The PR Interval: *What is Normal?***\n\nThe *best* lead to assess the PR interval in is usually **lead II**. The P wave should be ***upright*** in lead II if the rhythm is sinus. In adults — the PR interval is considered ***normal*** if it measures *between* **0.12** and **0.20 second** \\(*See* **Panel A** *in* Figure 04.2-1\\).\n\n+ The **PR interval** is ***\"short\"*** — if it measures ***less*** than **0.12 second** in duration in lead II \\(**Panel B**\\). One cause of a *short* PR interval is WPW \\(*Wolff-Parkinson-White*\\) syndrome in which an AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\) exists that *bypasses* the AV node, thereby requiring *less* time for the impulse to arrive in the ventricles \\(*See Section 05.37*\\). **NOTE:** *Not* all patients with a short PR interval \\(*0.12 sec.*\\) have WPW. Instead — the PR interval may sometimes be short because it is anatomically small or conduction is fast. *Beyond-the-Core:* The chance that a patient has an AP becomes greater when the PR interval is very short \\(ie, *0.10 second*\\). \n+ The **PR interval** is ***“long”*** — if it measures ***more*** than **0.20-0.21 second**. One can tell at a glance if the PR interval is long — by looking to see IF it is clearly *more* than 1 *large* box in duration \\(**Panel C** *in* Fig. 04.2-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 04.2-1:** Limits of the PR interval. **Panel A** — The PR interval is normal \\(*between 0.12-0.20 second in adults*\\). **Panel B** — the PR interval is short \\(*less than 0.12 second*\\). **Panel C** — the PR interval is long \\(*clearly more than one large box in duration*\\).\n\n**04.3 – The PR Interval: *Clinical Notes***\n\nWhen the PR interval is long — We say there is ***1st-degree* AV block**. Given that the *isolated* finding of 1st degree AV block \\(*even if marked*\\) is usually *not* clinically significant \\(*Section 02.70*\\) — we generally ***undercall*** this finding. *Our* preference is to accept a PR interval = 0.21 second as normal \\(*and not to call 1st degree until the PR interval is ***≥0.22 second*** = definitely more than 1 large box*\\). The PR interval in **Panel C** of Figure 04.2-1 is clearly *more* than 1 large box in duration \\(*We estimate the PR interval in Panel C to be ~0.26 second*\\).\n\n+ We prefer *not* to use the term, ***“borderline 1st degree”*** — since all this really says, is that you *almost* have a finding that *even if present* would *not* be clinically important. Instead, *our* preference is to say the PR interval is either normal \\(≤*0.21 second*\\) or long \\(\u003e*0.21 second*\\). \n+ ***Precise* determination** of a PR interval that falls within the normal range is *not* necessary. Clinically — it *does not matter* IF the PR is 0.16, 0.17 or for that matter 0.19 second. Instead, it suffices to simply say —* “the PR interval is normal\"*. \n+ ***Norms for* children** for the PR and QRS intervals are slightly different — because the pediatric heart is smaller than the adult heart. Specific normal limits for the various intervals are age-dependent. For example — a PR interval of 0.18 second may be prolonged for a *young* child, whereas it would be normal for a young adult. For the purposes of this ePub — it suffices to be aware that interval duration may differ slightly because of the smaller heart of a younger patient. \n\n \n\n\n\n**04.4 – Memory Aid: *How to Recall the 3 ECG Intervals***\n\nAn easy way to recall the *upper* limits of normal for the 3 ECG intervals is simply to *think of* the ***numbers*** “**1**” and “**2**” :\n\n+ The **PR interval** is **long** \\(*in adults*\\) — IF it is clearly *more* than “**1**” *large* box \\(\u003e*0.20-0.21 second in duration*\\). \n+ The **QRS** is **long** — IF it measures *more* than “**1/2**” a *large* box \\(\u003e*0.10 second in duration*\\). \n+ The **QT interval** is **long** — IF it comprises *more* than “**1/2**” the R-R interval. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.0 – Bundle Branch Block/IVCD**\n\n\n\n**05.1 – The QRS Interval: *What is Normal QRS Duration?***\n\nThe*** QRS interval ***represents the time it takes for ventricular depolarization to occur. With sinus rhythm in adults — the process of ventricular activation should **normally** be complete in ***no more*** than **0.10 second**. This means that IF the QRS complex is *longer* than ***half* a large box** in duration — that the QRS is “wide” \\(**Figure 05.5-1**\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.1-1:** The **QRS** is ***“wide”*** — IF it measures *more* than 0.10 second \\(*which is more than half a large box in duration*\\).\n\n***Clinical *Notes:** QRS duration can be measured from *any* of the 12 leads of a standard ECG. **Select** the **lead *in which ***the **QRS** complex **appears** to be ***longest****.*\n\n+ Practically speaking — all that matters is whether the QRS is normal or wide. Precise measurement of QRS duration for a complex that is clearly *within* the normal range is *not *necessary. Given that 0.10 second is the *upper normal* limit for QRS duration in adults — the QRS is said to be ***“wide”*** — IF it measures **more** than ***half*** a ***large *box** in duration \\(Figure 05.1-1\\). \n+ These limits for QRS interval duration do *not* hold true for children \\(*for whom lesser degrees of QRS prolongation may be abnormal*\\). \n\n \n\n**05.2 – IF the QRS is Wide: *What Next? *\\(BBB Algorithm\\)**\n\nIF the QRS complex is wide — We suggest that you ***STOP\\! ***At this point —***Short-circuit*** your *usual* sequence. Instead of your usual *systematic* approach — We suggest the following:\n\n+ First** **— ***Ensure*** that the **patient** is ***stable\\!*** This is because IF the patient is unstable \\(*and the rhythm is VT* = *Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) — you may need to *immediately* shock \\(*Section 02.47*\\). \n+ But — IF the QRS is wide and the rhythm is supraventricular — the ***next* step** in your ECG interpretation approach should be to proceed according to the ***Algorithm*** shown in **Figure 05.2-1**: \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.2-1:** Algorithm — for how to proceed IF the rhythm is supraventricular \\(ie*, not WPW or VT*\\) and the QRS is wide. You should be able to determine the type of conduction defect in *no more* than a few seconds \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***KEY* Point:** — IF the QRS is Wide and the rhythm is supraventricular \\(ie, *sinus, AV nodal*\\) — then **determine *WHY*** the QRS is **wide** *before* proceeding further with your interpretation. Practically speaking \\(*and assuming we are not dealing with VT or WPW*\\) — there are *only* **3 reasons** for QRS widening with sinus rhythm:\n\n+ There is ***typical* RBBB \\(*R****ight ****B****undle ****B****ranch ****B****lock*\\). \n+ There is ***typical* LBBB \\(*L****eft ****B****undle ****B****ranch ****B****lock*\\). \n+ The QRS is wide but *neither* typical RBBB *nor* typical LBBB is present. In this case, the reason the QRS is wide will be **IVCD \\(*I****ntra****V****entricular ****C****onduction ****D****elay***\\).** \n\n \n\nThe “good news” \\(*as discussed on the next few pages*\\) — is that use of the **Algorithm** in Figure 05.2-1 allows ***accurate* diagnosis** of the type of conduction defect \\(*BBB or IVCD*\\) in ***less*** than **5 seconds**\\!\n\n+ The reason we can *accurately* diagnose the type of conduction defect so quickly — is that: **i\\)** There are *only* 3 possible answers \\(*typical RBBB; typical LBBB; *or* IVCD*\\); and **ii\\)** We ***only* need** to look at **3 leads** to make the diagnosis. **NOTE:** With experience — You’ll look at *all* 12 leads for finer aspects of ECG interpretation. But *only* 3 leads are needed to diagnose the *type* of conduction defect. \n+ The **3 *KEY* leads** \\(*and the only 3 leads needed*\\) to determine the *type* of conduction defect \\(*RBBB, LBBB, *or* IVCD*\\) — are **leads I, V1,** and** V6**. NOTE: We key in on **2 *left-sided* leads** \\(*leads I,V6*\\) — and **1 *right-sided* lead** \\(*lead V1*\\) when using Figure 05.2-1 to diagnose the *type* of conduction defect: \n+ **Remember** — Use of the algorithm in Fig. 05.2-1 implies that the rhythm is supraventricular \\(*and not VT or WPW*\\). \n\n \n\n**05.3 – FIGURE 05.3-1: *Why the Need for the BBB Algorithm?***\n\nThe reason you want to recognize conduction defects *before* you get too far in the interpretation process — is that criteria for axis, LVH, RVH, ischemia and infarction are *all different* when there is BBB or IVCD\\! Consider the example in **Figure 05.3-1**, obtained from a hemodynamically stable patient with a history of heart failure:\n\n+ Has this patient had an *anterior* MI \\(*slanted red arrows*\\) at some point in the past? \n+ Is there *ongoing* lateral ischemia \\(*red circle*\\) in lead V6? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.3-1:** 12-lead ECG obtained from a stable patient with a history of heart failure. The rhythm is sinus \\(*vertical arrow in lead II insert*\\) — and the QRS is wide. *What next?* Has there been *anterior* infarction \\(*slanted arrows*\\)? Is there *lateral* ischemia \\(*red circle in lead V6*\\)?\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.3-1:** The patient is hemodynamically stable. The rhythm is sinus \\(*vertical arrow in the lead II insert*\\) — and the QRS complex is wide. Thus, although one might be tempted to call *anterior* MI \\(*slanted arrows in V1,V2,V3*\\) and ongoing ischemia \\(*red circle in lead V6*\\) — the Algorithm in Figure 05.2-1 advises us to first ***STOP*** and diagnose ***WHY* the QRS is wide \\(?\\)** *before* proceeding further.\n\n+ As we will discuss momentarily — the reason for QRS widening in Figure 05.3-1 is ***complete* LBBB** \\(*See Section 05.6*\\). As a result — the deep *anterior* QS complexes and *lateral* ST-T wave changes are simply expected consequences of LBBB and *not* indicative of prior infarction or ischemia. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** Had we *not* STOPPED at an *early* point in the interpretation process to assess the reason for QRS widening — we would have spent *needless* time thinking the patient had potentially active ischemia/infarction — when in reality there is *no* evidence of acute change on this ECG. \n\n \n\n**05.4 – *Typical* RBBB: *Criteria for ECG Recognition***\n\nThe 12-lead appearance of typical *complete* RBBB in the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\) is schematically shown in **Figure 05.4-1**. ECG criteria for diagnosis of ***complete* RBBB** include the following:\n\n+ **QRS widening** to *at least ***0.11 second**. \n+ An **rSR'** or **rsR'** in *right-sided*** lead V1**. \n+ A ***wide* terminal S wave** in **lead I** and** lead V6**. The QRS complex is usually predominantly positive in these *left-sided* leads with RBBB. There may or may not be an initial small q wave. The *KEY* to *confirming* the diagnosis of RBBB is the *wide terminal S wave* in leads V1,V6 \\(Figure 05.4-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.4-1:** *Schematic* ECG of *typical* ***complete* RBBB** in the 3 *KEY* leads. Note the rsR’ in lead V1 and wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6. ***Memory* Aid** — *Think of ****R****BBB and the \"****R****'s\"* — in that there is an **r**S**R'** complex with a* taller ****R****ight ****r****abbit ear* \\(the R’\\) in a ***R****ight-sided* lead \\(= *lead V1*\\).\n\n***Clinical* Example of *Complete* RBBB:** We illustrate application of the criteria for diagnosis of *complete* RBBB by our *sequential* approach to the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 05.4-2**:\n\n+ The rhythm in this ECG is ***sinus* tachycardia** at a rate just over 100/minute \\(*arrow in lead II indicating upright sinus P wave*\\). \n+ The **QRS** complex is **wide** \\(≥*0.11 second*\\). QRS duration is best assessed from a lead where the QRS is well defined and its duration appears to be longest. Despite seemingly normal QRS duration in several leads on this tracing \\(*leads aVL,V3,V4*\\) — there is *little* doubt that the QRS is clearly *more* than half a large box in duration in lead V1. \n+ Identification of a sinus rhythm *with* QRS widening is indication to ***STOP*** our systematic approach and branch to the **Algorithm** in **Figure 05.2-1**. We focus on the **3 *KEY* leads** \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\). As shown in the inserts in Figure 05.4-2 — ***complete* RBBB** is diagnosed by the ***typical* rSR’** in V1 \\(*with taller right rabbit ear*\\) and the **wide *terminal* S wave** in leads I,V6. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.4-2:** 12-lead ECG showing ***complete* RBBB** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.5 – RBBB: *Clinical Notes***\n\nThe *upper normal* limit for QRS duration in adults is **0.10 second** \\(*half of a large box*\\). Anything *more* than 0.10 second is long \\(*Section 05.1*\\).\n\n+ ***Complete* RBBB** may occur with a **QRS** of **0.11 second**. This *differs* from the situation for LBBB — for which the QRS must attain ≥0.12 second \\(*Section 05.6*\\). The RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) is much *thinner *than the LV — so RBBB may be *“complete”* with a QRS complex that is *not* as wide as it needs to be when there is *complete* LBBB \\(*conduction through nonspecialized myocardial fibers in the blocked right ventricle may be complete within 0.11 second *— *whereas it will take *≥*0.12 second to get through the thicker LV when there is LBBB*\\). \n+ An ***incomplete* RBBB** is said to be present — IF QRS morphology is typical in leads I,V1,V6 — but the QRS is *not* prolonged to at least 0.11 second \\(*See Section 05.18*\\). \n+ RBBB is a*** terminal *delay**. It does *not* affect the initial part of ventricular activation \\(*during which time the septum is activated *and* during which time Q waves are written*\\). As a result — **Q waves** may still be written *despite* RBBB. This differs from LBBB — which alters septal and initial vector activation \\(*thereby hiding most Q waves\\!* — *See Sections 05.7, 05.8*\\). Note that *despite* the ***complete* RBBB** present in Figure 05.4-2 — ***inferior* Q waves** \\(*in leads II,III,aVF*\\) are still seen \\(*which may be indicative of inferior infarction of uncertain age*\\). \n+ The ***terminal* delay** of **RBBB** may account for the fact that: **i\\)** the R’ in V1 may be quite tall \\(*the LV has already depolarized — so the small RV is unopposed as it depolarizes*\\); and **ii\\)** the terminal S wave in leads V1,V6 is wide \\(*conduction through the blocked RV is slow due to the RBBB*\\). \n+ **RBBB** is a **relatively *common*** conduction defect that is *not* necessarily associated with underlying pathology \\(*especially if seen in an otherwise healthy adult with a normal physical exam and no history of heart disease*\\). IF doubt exists about possible *underlying* heart disease — an **Echo** could be obtained \\(*though an Echo is not necessarily needed on a routine basis*\\). In contrast — *new* RBBB in a patient with *acute* MI is clearly cause for concern \\(*suggests a larger infarct and more worrisome course*\\). \n+ In contrast to **RBBB** \\(*which may be a relatively benign finding in otherwise healthy adults*\\) — the finding of ***complete* LBBB** is *almost always* associated with some significant *underlying* cardiac pathology. \n\n \n\n**05.6 – *Typical* LBBB: *Criteria for ECG Recognition***\n\nThe 12-lead appearance of typical *complete* LBBB in the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\) is schematically shown in **Figure 05.6-1**. ECG criteria for ***complete* LBBB** include the following:\n\n+ **QRS widening** to *at least ***0.12 second** \\(*whereas complete RBBB can occur with a QRS = 0.11 second*\\). \n+ An **upright** \\(*monophasic*\\)** QRS** complex in **leads I** and **V6** that may \\(*or may not*\\) be notched. But — there should *not* normally be any q wave in *either* lead I or V6. \n+ A predominantly*** negative* QRS** complex in** lead V1**. There may \\(*or may not*\\) be an initial small r wave in lead V1 \\(*lead V1 may show either a QS *or* rS complex*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.6-1:** *Schematic* ECG of *typical* ***complete* LBBB** in the 3 *KEY* leads. NOTE: — there should *never* normally be a Q wave in a *left-sided* lead \\(*lead I,V6*\\) with *typical* LBBB *unless* there has been *prior* infarction \\(*Section 05.28*\\).\n\n**05.7 – FIGURE 05.7-1: *LBBB alters Septal Activation ***\n\nNormally — the very first part of the ventricles to depolarize \\(*after the impulse passes through the AV node and Bundle of His*\\) — is the ***left* side** of the ***ventricular* septum**. As a result — septal depolarization ***normally* moves** from ***left-to-right*** \\(*arrow pointing left-to-right in* **Panel A** of Figure 05.7-1\\).\n\n+ Since the **RBB** \\(*Right Bundle Branch*\\) travels down the *right* side of the septum — this initial ***left-to-right*** direction of septal depolarization does *not* change when there is **RBBB** because the *left* side of the septum *remains intact* and still initiates septal depolarization \\(**Panel B**\\). \n+ In contrast, with **LBBB** — the normal *left-to-right* direction of septal activation will change. This is because the block with LBBB *prevents* the initial vector of septal activation from starting on the left \\(**Panel C**\\). As a result — ventricular activation with **LBBB** moves almost entirely from ***right-to-left***. Thus, the *initial* part of the QRS complex \\(*during which time Q waves are written*\\) is altered by LBBB that *changes* the direction of septal depolarization. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.7-1:** Sequence of ***normal* septal activation** — in which there is *left-to-right* septal depolarization \\(*arrow in* Panel A\\). This left-to-right direction is *preserved* with **RBBB** \\(Panel B\\) — but *becomes* ***right-to-left*** with **LBBB** \\(*arrow in* Panel C\\).\n\nIt is this *altered* direction of *initial* septal activation that accounts for many of the **ECG *findings*** of **LBBB**:** **\n\n+ Because *septal* activation with **LBBB** moves *right-to-left* — the **small* “septal q waves”*** that are often normally present in one or more ***lateral* leads** \\(*I,aVL,V6*\\) **should *not* be seen**. IF a Q wave \\(*even a small one*\\) is seen in a *lateral* lead \\(*I, aVL or V6*\\) in a patient with LBBB — that patient has had a *prior* infarction. \n+ Following ***right-to-left* septal activation** \\(*arrow in* **Panel C** *of* Figure 05.7-1\\) — ventricular activation continues to the *left* and *posteriorly*, as the large LV is depolarized. This results in the totally *upright* complex \\(*R wave*\\) seen in *left-sided* leads \\(*I,V6*\\) with LBBB. There may or may not be a notch = RR’ in leads I,V6 \\(**Figure 05.6-1**\\). \n+ *Right-to-left *septal activation, followed by continued leftward depolarization \\(*as the rest of the LV is activated*\\) — results in a predominantly *negative *complex \\(*QS or rS*\\) in *right-sided* lead V1 with LBBB. Neighboring *anterior* leads \\(*V1,V2,V3*\\) often manifest a QS complex with LBBB *without* this indicating prior MI \\(Figure 05.8-1* in the next Section*\\). \n\n \n\n**05.8 – FIGURE 05.8-1: *Clinical *Example of *Complete *LBBB **\n\nWe illustrate application of the criteria for diagnosis of *complete* LBBB by our *sequential* approach to the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 05.8-1**:\n\n+ The rhythm in this ECG is ***sinus* tachycardia** at a rate of ~100/minute \\(*arrow in lead II indicating upright sinus P wave*\\). \n+ The **QRS** complex is **wide** \\(*at least 0.12 second in duration*\\). \n+ Identification of a sinus rhythm *with* QRS widening is indication to ***STOP*** our systematic approach and branch to the **Algorithm** in **Figure 05.2-1**. We focus on the **3 *KEY* leads** \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\). As shown in the inserts in Figure 05.8-1 — ***complete* LBBB** is diagnosed by the predominantly ***negative* QRS** complex in **lead V1** and the monophasic ***upright* R wave** in **leads I** and **V6**. \n+ Note that the R wave is *notched* in lead I of Fig. 05.8-1 — but *not* in lead V6. R wave notching in one or more lateral leads may or may not be seen with LBBB. No definite clinical implications are conveyed by its presence or absence. \n+ Note also that there are **QS complexes** in **leads V1-thru-V3** and there is **ST-T wave depression** in several ***lateral* leads** \\(*I,V5,V6*\\). Both of these findings are common with LBBB, and do *not* convey any information regarding possible ischemia/infarction. In addition — the slight \\(*but not marked*\\) ST elevation seen in anterior precordial leads is common and an *expected* finding with LBBB. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* We also draw attention to the QS complex seen in leads III and aVF of Figure 05.8-1. Because LBBB changes the sequence of *initial* ventricular activation \\(*during which time Q waves are written*\\) — the presence of Q waves in leads *other than* the lateral leads is *not* indicative of infarction when there is LBBB. ***Bottom* Line:** All we can say about the ECG in Figure 05.8-1 is that there is *complete* LBBB. There is *no* evidence of any acute change. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.8-1:** 12-lead ECG showing ***complete* LBBB** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.9 – LBBB: *Clinical Notes***\n\nThe ECG finding of **LBBB** is virtually *always* associated with significant ***underlying* heart disease** \\(ie, *cardiomyopathy, longstanding hypertension with LVH, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular or congenital heart disease*\\). It is rare in adults \\(*or in children*\\) to find *isolated *“benign” LBBB.\n\n+ The **diagnosis** of ***other* conditions** \\(*ischemia, infarction, ventricular hypertrophy*\\) — will always be ***more* difficult** when there is **BBB**. This is *especially* true for LBBB — which changes the *direction* of *initial* septal activation \\(*Section 05.7*\\). That said — diagnosis of *other* conditions is *not* impossible on certain occasions \\(*See Sections 05.24-through-05.32*\\). \n+ The reason ***no* “septal” q wave** should be seen with ***typical* LBBB** in *either* **lead I** or** lead V6** — is that LBBB causes the septum to be activated from *right-to-left*. As a result — *left-sided* leads \\(*I,V6 and for that matter aVL and V5*\\) see the *initial* activation vector as coming *toward* instead of moving away from the left \\(**Panel C** *in* Figure 05.7-1\\). IF on the other hand, there has been ***septal *MI** — you may then see a small q wave in one or more lateral leads *despite* the LBBB. \n\n \n\n**05.10 –* Incomplete *LBBB: *Does it Exist?***\n\nThere is an entity known as*** “incomplete LBBB”***. That said — *incomplete* LBBB is very uncommon, difficult to diagnose, and usually ***not* clinically important** to distinguish from *nonspecific* IVCD. This differs from the situation with *incomplete *RBBB which is very common and *easy* to diagnose \\(*See Section 05.18*\\).\n\n+ Complicating **diagnosis** of ***incomplete* LBBB** is uncertainty about *when* LBBB is *truly* complete. IF for example, the QRS *continues* to widen over a period of months-to-years \\(*say, from 0.12 to 0.14 to 0.16 second*\\) — at *what* point was the LBBB “complete”? Recognition of *incomplete* LBBB is also made more difficult by the fact that *other* conditions \\(ie, *LAHB, LVH*\\) may slightly widen the QRS in a *similar-appearing* pattern. \n+ *Practically* Speaking — the diagnosis of ***incomplete* LBBB** is really a *retrospective* one. It is only *over time* that you can know with certainty that a *prior* ECG with *some* QRS widening was in fact one stage in an *evolving* process that ultimately led to *more* QRS widening that *finally* became *complete* LBBB. ***BOTTOM* Line:** While nice to be aware of the controversy and *lack* of consensus regarding the “definition” of *incomplete* LBBB — this diagnosis is difficult to prove and usually of *little* clinical benefit. We therefore suggest *not to worry *about trying to distinguish between *“incomplete LBBB”* vs *slight* QRS widening due to a *nonspecific* IVCD pattern. \n\n \n\n**05.11 – IVCD: *Criteria for ECG Recognition***\n\nThe ECG appearance of **IVCD** \\(*IntraVentricular Conduction Delay *or* Defect*\\) — is difficult to characterize. This is because IVCD is often the ***end result*** of a number of *different* pathophysiologic processes — rather than a discrete defect in the conduction system \\(*as usually occurs with RBBB or LBBB*\\).\n\n+ Examples of conditions that may lead to IVCD include myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy with ventricular fibrosis, chamber enlargement — and/or any *combination* of these \\(*with or without an associated component of BBB*\\). \n\n \n\nA *schematic* example of IVCD is shown in **Figure 05.11-1**. ECG diagnostic criteria for **IVCD** include the following:\n\n+ **QRS widening** to *at least ***0.11 second**. \n+ *Neither* **typical RBBB** *nor*** typical LBBB** is present. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.11-1:** *Schematic* example of **IVCD**. QRS morphology is *not* typical here for either RBBB or LBBB in *all* 3 of the *KEY* leads \\(*leads I and V1 are consistent with RBBB *— but *lead V6 suggests LBBB*\\). Clearly — *many forms *of IVCD are possible in addition to the one shown here.\n\n**05.12 – IVCD: *Clinical Notes***\n\nThe term **“IVCD”** is used to describe the entity in which there is sinus rhythm with QRS widening — but QRS morphology in the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*I,V1,V6*\\) is *not* typical for either RBBB or LBBB.\n\n+ This use of the term **“IVCD”** is ***“magic”*** — as it tremendously simplifies \\(*and expedites*\\) the diagnostic process. Once we *rule out* VT and WPW — We *know* QRS widening in a supraventricular rhythm will be due to *either* RBBB, LBBB or IVCD \\(*See* **Algorithm** *in* **Figure 05.2-1**\\). \n+ IF criteria for RBBB and LBBB are *not* met \\(*in each of the 3 KEY leads*\\) — then **IVCD** is the reason for the wide QRS. *End of process\\! *We illustrate this concept in the clinical example of IVCD shown below \\(Figure 05.13-1\\). \n\n \n\nNOTE: It will often be difficult \\(*if not impossible*\\) with IVCD to assess for LVH/RVH; *prior* MI; or *acute* ST-T wave changes.\n\n+ As is the case for RBBB and LBBB — the ***clinical* significance** of **IVCD** depends greatly on the setting in which it occurs. Slight QRS widening \\(*of up to 0.10-to-0.11 second*\\) — is occasionally seen in otherwise *healthy* young adults \\(*in which case, this slight QRS widening of “IVCD” is most often of no clinical significance*\\). \n+ IF doubt exists about the presence of underlying structural heart disease — an **Echo** could be obtained \\(*although an Echo is not necessarily needed on a routine basis*\\). \n+ In contrast — IVCD in an older adult with chest pain or heart failure may carry similar implications as would LBBB \\(ie, *coronary artery disease, infarction, cardiomyopathy*\\). ***Clinical *correlation ***is everything\\!* \n\n \n\n**05.13 – FIGURE 05.13-1: *Clinical *Example of IVCD**\n\nWe illustrate application of the criteria for diagnosis of IVCD by our *sequential* approach to the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 05.13-1**:\n\n+ The rhythm in this ECG is **AFib** \\(*Atrial Fibrillation*\\) — because it is *irregularly* irregular *without* P waves. \n+ The **QRS** complex is **wide** \\(*at least 0.12 second*\\). \n+ Identification of a supraventricular rhythm *with* QRS widening is indication to ***STOP*** our systematic approach and branch to the **Algorithm** in **Figure 05.2-1**. We focus on the **3 *KEY* leads** \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\). As shown in the inserts in Figure 05.13-1 —** IVCD** is diagnosed because QRS morphology does *not* resemble either RBBB or LBBB in *each* of the 3 key leads. That is, the QRS complex in lead I of Fig. 05.13-1 looks like LBBB — but *not* in leads V1,V6 \\(*which if anything look more like RBBB*\\). ***Bottom* Line:** One *can’t say much else* about this tracing beyond AFib with a *controlled* ventricular response *plus* QRS widening due to IVCD. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.13-1:** 12-lead ECG showing **IVCD** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.14 – ST-T Wave Changes: *What Happens with BBB?***\n\nRBBB and LBBB each alter the *sequence* of ventricular depolarization. This is why they produce the alterations in QRS morphology discussed in this Section. As a *direct* result of this altered sequence of activation — these conduction defects *also* alter the sequence of ventricular *repolarization, *which leads to development of ***secondary*** \\(2°\\)** ST-T wave changes \\(**Figure 05.14-1**\\)**.\n\n+ The ST-T wave changes shown in Fig. 05.14-1 are called *secondary — *because they are the direct *result* of \\(ie, *they are secondary to*\\) the conduction defect itself. That is *— *We *expect* to see this pattern of ST-T wave response shown in **Figure 05.14-1** as a normal part of RBBB or LBBB. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.14-1:** The *expected* ST-T wave response to either *typical* RBBB or *typical* LBBB is ***“ST opposition”***. That is *— *the ST segment *and* T wave should be ***oppositely *directed **to the ***last* QRS deflection** \\(*red and yellow arrows*\\) in *each* of the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*= leads I,V1,V6*\\). Deviation from this pattern is abnormal *— *and indicates a ***primary*** \\(1°\\)** ST-T wave change** \\(*that suggests ischemia *or* infarction*\\).\n\n***KEY *Points:** The *beauty* of the *“ST opposition”* rule in **Figure 05.14-1** — is that it allows you to assess ST-T morphology with BBB *within* 2-3 seconds\\!\n\n+ Although we do look at *all* 12 leads with BBB, when applying the ST-T wave *opposition* principle — Look *only* in the 3 *KEY* leads \\(= *leads I,V1,V6*\\). Once you have done so — You can refine your interpretation by looking at ST-T wave changes in the remaining leads \\(*See Section 05.15*\\). \n+ **NOTE:** The *“ST opposition”* rule works for RBBB and LBBB — but *not* for IVCD \\(*which is why it is often quite difficult to assess for acute changes with IVCD*\\). \n\n \n\n****\n\n**05.15 – FIGURE 05.15-1: *Assessing ST-T Wave Changes with BBB***\n\n*Apply* the ***“ST opposition”* rule** to the examples of RBBB and LBBB shown in **Figure 05.15-1** \\(*in which we reproduce the ECGs previously shown in *Figure 05.4-2 *and* Figure 05.8-1\\). Are the ST-T waves in the 3 *KEY* leads doing what they should for bundle branch block seen in each case?\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.15-1:** Are ST-T changes *as expected* for the examples of ***typical* RBBB** \\(*Top tracing*\\) and **LBBB** \\(*Bottom tracing*\\) seen here?\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.15-1:** Sinus rhythm with QRS widening is seen for both tracings shown here. Focus on the **3 *KEY* leads** \\(I,V1,V6\\) allows *rapid* diagnosis of ***complete* RBBB** \\(*top tracing*\\) and ***complete* LBBB** \\(*bottom tracing*\\). It should now take *no more* than seconds to establish that ST-T waves \\(*white arrows*\\) are ***oppositely* directed** to the ***last* QRS deflection** \\(*red arrows*\\) in *each* of the 3 *key* leads. Looking at this in more detail:\n\n+ ***TOP* Tracing** — Recognition of the rSR’ \\(*with taller right rabbit ear*\\) in V1 and wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6 define the conduction defect as **RBBB**. The last QRS deflection in lead V1 is upward \\(*the R’ = red arrow in V1*\\) — so the ST-T wave is *appropriately* negative \\(*white arrow*\\). Terminal S waves in leads I,V6 inscribe a downward deflection \\(*red arrows in these leads*\\) — so the T wave is *appropriately* upright in both lead I and V6 \\(*white arrows*\\). \n+ ***BOTTOM* Tracing** — Recognition of a monophasic upright R wave in left-sided leads I,V6 and a predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V1 defines the conduction defect as **LBBB**. The *only* QRS deflection in leads I,V6 is upward \\(*the monophasic R wave = red arrows in I,V6*\\) — so the ST-T wave is negative in these leads \\(*white arrows*\\). Lead V1 manifests a predominantly negative QRS deflection \\(*red arrow in V1*\\) — so the ST-T wave is *appropriately* upright in this lead \\(*white arrow*\\). \n+ **NOTE:** *Neighboring* leads may or may not manifest **ST-T wave *opposition*** to the last QRS deflection. For example, there is ST-T wave opposition for *anterior* leads V2,V3 in the *bottom* tracing \\(*negative QRS with upright T wave*\\) — but *not* necessarily for all of the other leads. For this reason — Our focus in on looking at the **3 *KEY* leads** = leads **I**, **V1** and **V6**. \n\n \n\n**05.16 – RBBB *Equivalent* Patterns**\n\nThe shape of the QRS complex in lead V1 may vary greatly with RBBB. It will *not* always show a \"neat\" rSR’ \\(*or* rsR'\\) in this lead. Instead, *any* of the patterns shown for lead V1 in **Figure 05.16-1** qualify for diagnosis of **RBBB** — as long as the QRS complex is widened \\(*to ≥ 0.11 second*\\) — and as long as there is a wide *terminal* S wave in *left-sided* leads *I and V6*.\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.16-1:** RBBB *“Equivalent”* Patterns in lead V1. Despite *lack* of a *taller-right-rabbit-ear* rSR’ pattern in lead V1 — **RBBB** is *still* present IF: **i\\)** the QRS is wide \\(*≥ 0.11 second*\\); **ii\\)** an *upright* QRS complex *similar* to one of the patterns shown here is seen in lead V1; and** iii\\)** a wide *terminal* S wave is seen in lead I and lead V6.\n\n***KEY* Points:** Normally — the QRS complex in lead V1 is *predominantly* negative. This is because this *right-sided* lead \\(*V1*\\) sees electrical activity as *moving away* from V1 \\(*or toward the left ventricle*\\). The finding of predominant *positive* activity \\(ie, *a tall R wave*\\) in *right-sided* lead V1 is *not* “normal”.\n\n+ IF the rhythm is sinus and the QRS is wide with an ***“RBBB-Equivalent” *pattern** in **lead V1** — then the conduction defect is **RBBB** — as long as there are **wide *terminal* S waves** in **leads I** and **V6** \\(Figure 05.16-1\\). \n+ Reasons why the typical triphasic \\(*rsR’; taller right rabbit ear*\\) complex in V1 may be *lost* in some patients with RBBB include scarring \\(*as may occur with cardiomyopathy*\\) and/or infarction \\(*which would be especially suggested by a qR pattern in lead V1*\\). \n\n \n\n**05.17 – FIGURE 05.17-1: *Is this RBBB?***\n\nThe schematic tracing in Figure 05.17-1 shows sinus rhythm and QRS widening.\n\n+ What *type* of BBB is seen in **Figure 05.17-1**? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.17-1:** What *type* of conduction block is present?\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.17-1:** Lead II shows the rhythm is sinus. The QRS is wide and *upright* in lead V1 — but *not* in the usual **rSR’** \\(*taller right rabbit ear*\\) pattern for *typical *RBBB. Instead, the *left *rabbit ear is *taller*. This qualifies as an ***“RBBB Equivalent” ***pattern \\(Figure 05.16-1\\). Since wide terminal S waves *are* seen in the lateral leads \\(*I,V6*\\) — this tracing satisfies criteria for **RBBB**. ST-T wave changes *are* appropriate \\(*opposite the last QRS deflection in the 3 key leads*\\) — so there are *no* acute changes.\n\n**05.18 –* Incomplete *RBBB: *How is it Diagnosed?***\n\nAs discussed in Section 05.5 — **IRBBB** \\(*Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block*\\) is diagnosed when QRS morphology is consistent with RBBB \\(*Section 05.4*\\) but **QRS *duration*** is ***less*** than** 0.11 second** \\(Figure 05.18-1\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.18-1:** ECG showing **IRBBB** \\(*Incomplete Right Bundle Branch Block*\\) — obtained from a healthy young adult. An rSr’ is seen in lead V1 *with* S waves in leads I,V6 — but QRS duration is 0.11 sec \\(*not more than half a large box*\\). Note that the S waves seen in leads I,V6 are *narrow*.\n\n***KEY *Points about IRBBB:** Patients with IRBBB run the gamut from *common* occurrence in *up to* ~5% of otherwise healthy young adults \\(*in which case it is benign*\\) — to IRBBB serving as an ECG sign of RVH/COPD; acute pulmonary embolus; or acute conduction system damage seen with acute MI. ***Clinical *correlation ***is everything\\!*\n\n+ An **rSr’** in **lead V1** \\(*and/or in leads III or V2 *\\) — is a common *benign* finding in healthy young adults \\(*due to normal late depolarization of the RV outflow track*\\). IF, as is seen in Figure 05.18-1 there is *also* an S wave in leads I and V6 — then we define this as **“IRBBB”**. If S waves are missing — We simply say, *“an rSr’ is present in lead V1”*. \n+ Note that the ST-T wave in lead V1 of Figure 05.18-1 is inverted. This is an *expected* finding given the IRBBB pattern in V1 \\(*See Section 05.14 on the ST opposition rule*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Be aware that placing chest leads V1 and V2 an interspace *too high* is a technical mishap that may misleadingly induce an rSr’ pattern in these leads \\(*Section 03.21*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.19 – PRACTICE: *Bundle Branch Block***\n\n\n\nInterpret the following 2 *schematic* and 2 *real* tracings \\(*Sections 05.20-thru-05.23*\\). Sinus rhythm is present in *each* tracing — but the QRS is wide. What *type* of conduction defect is present? Is there indication of possible *ongoing* ischemia/infarction in *any* of these tracings?\n\n+ Our ***Answers*** follow each case. \n+ **Hint:** Feel free to ***refer back*** to Figures 05.2-1; 05.4-1; 05.6-1; 05.11-1; *and* 05.14-1 while formulating your answers. \n\n \n\n**05.20 – PRACTICE: *Tracing A***\n\nIn *schematic* **Tracing A** \\(Figure 05.20-1\\) — there is sinus rhythm with QRS widening.\n\n+ What type of BBB is present? Is *anything else* going on? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.20-1:** *Practice* **Tracing A**. *What type of BBB is present?*\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing A:** There is sinus rhythm with QRS widening. QRS morphology is consistent with the pattern of ***complete *LBBB** in *each* of the 3 key leads \\(*Section 05.6*\\). However, a **Q wave** is present in Lead V6. This is *not* normally seen with *typical *LBBB. The finding of a Q wave in a *lateral* lead \\(*I, aVL,or V6*\\) with LBBB indicates *prior* infarction.\n\n+ There are also ***abnormal*** \\(ie, *primary*\\)** ST-T wave changes** in the 3 key leads As emphasized in Section 05.14 \\(Figure 05.14-1\\) — the T wave with *typical* LBBB should *not* be upright in lead I. The T wave should also *not* be negative in lead V1 with *uncomplicated* LBBB. \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** We interpret *schematic* **Tracing A** as showing **LBBB** with ***primary *ST-T wave changes**. This suggests infarction has taken place at some point in the past. Clinical history and comparison with prior tracings would be needed to determine if the changes seen are new, recent or old. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Rather than “lateral” infarction — the Q wave in lead V6 indicates prior *septal* infarction. As discussed and illustrated in Section 05.7 — LBBB changes the direction of septal activation \\(*from left-to-right to right-to-left*\\). Thus, development of a Q wave in a *lateral* lead with LBBB indicates further disturbance with the process *septal* activation, presumably due to *septal* infarction. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.21 – PRACTICE: *Tracing B***\n\nIn *schematic* **Tracing B** \\(Figure 05.21-1\\) — there is sinus rhythm with QRS widening.\n\n+ What *type* of conduction defect is present? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.21-1:** *Practice* **Tracing B**. *What type of conduction defect is present?*\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing B:** There is sinus rhythm with QRS widening. That said — QRS morphology is *not* consistent with either RBBB or LBBB in *each* of the 3 key leads. That is — the monophasic R wave in lead I looks like LBBB; the wide terminal S wave in V6 is consistent with RBBB; and the R=S pattern in V1 looks like *neither* LBBB *nor* RBBB.\n\n+ By the process of elimination — we interpret the conduction defect in Figure 05.21-1 as **IVCD** \\(*Section 05.11*\\). \n+ ST–T wave morphology is difficult to interpret with IVCD. This is because the **ST *Opposition* Rule** does ***not*** necessarily work with **IVCD** \\(*Section 05.14*\\). As a result — ST-T waves are *not* necessarily directed opposite to the last QRS deflection in the 3 key leads. It may therefore *not* be possible to assess for ischemia/infarction when there is IVCD \\(*unless ST-T wave changes are extreme*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.22 – PRACTICE: *Tracing C***\n\nThere is again sinus rhythm with QRS widening in **Tracing C** \\(Figure 05.22-1\\).\n\n+ What type of BBB is present? Is *anything else* going on? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.22-1:** *Practice* **Tracing C**. *What type of BBB is present? *Is *anything else* going on?\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing C:** The rhythm is sinus bradycardia at ~50/minute. The QRS complex is wide in a pattern consistent with ***complete* RBBB** \\(*Section 05.4*\\). That is — there is an rSR’ \\(*with taller right rabbit ear*\\) in lead V1 *with* wide terminal S waves in *both* leads I and V6.\n\n+ **NOTE-1:** ST-T waves are *not* as expected for *uncomplicated* BBB \\(*Section 05.14*\\). That is — **ST-T waves** in Figure 05.22-1 are ***not* oppositely directed** to the last QRS deflection in *each* of the 3 *KEY* leads. Instead — there is ST flattening in leads I,V1 and T wave inversion \\(*instead of an upright T wave*\\) in lead V6. Thus there are ***primary* ST-T wave changes** on this tracing — which suggests possible recent or *ongoing* ischemia/infarction. \n+ **NOTE-2:** The ECG in Figure 05.22-1 — provides an excellent example of how we use the concept of ***neighboring* leads** to refine our interpretation. Thus, the **ST *Opposition* Rule** \\(Figure 05.14-1\\) — allows us to quickly determine that ST-T wave depression in lead V6 is *not* normal for *typical* RBBB. We therefore should *not* expect neighboring leads \\(ie, *leads V4,V5*\\) to manifest the deep *symmetric* T wave inversion that is seen in Fig. 05.14-1. This suggests that in addition to RBBB — there is a wider area of *lateral* ischemia. \n+ Finally — there are relatively *larger-than-expected* **Q waves** in the ***lateral* leads** \\(*leads I, V5, V6, and especially aVL*\\). Especially in the context of RBBB and *primary* ST-T wave changes — these Q waves \\(*particularly the relatively deep Q in lead aVL*\\) may well reflect infarction of *uncertain* age. \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** — We interpret the ECG in **Tracing C** as showing sinus bradycardia with *complete* RBBB. There are *lateral* Q waves of *uncertain* significance and *primary* ST-T wave changes that suggest **possible *infarction***/**ischemia** of ***uncertain* age** in* addition to *RBBB. This *could be* acute. *Clinical correlation* is needed. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The question often arises as to *how far over* in the anterior leads ST-T wave depression from RBBB may be seen? We *expect* to see ST-T wave depression in leads V1,V2 with RBBB as part of the normal secondary ST-T wave changes of BBB. This was seen in the 12-lead ECG example of *typical* RBBB shown in Figure 05.4-2. Sometimes *anterior* ST-T depression with typical RBBB may carry over as far as lead V3 — but it should usually *not* go beyond this\\! It should be clear that ST-T wave appearance in Figure 05.22-1 is *not* normal because: **i\\)** the ST-T wave should be upright in lead V6 \\(*as well as in leads V4,V5*\\); and **ii\\)** the ST segment becomes *coved* in lead V3 — and the *amount* of T wave inversion in V3 is *increased* compared to V2 \\(*whereas with simple RBBB we would expect a decrease in amount of ST-T wave change from V2-to-V3*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.23 – PRACTICE: *Tracing D***\n\nA final example of sinus rhythm with QRS widening is seen in **Tracing D** \\(Figure 05.23-1\\).\n\n+ What *type* of conduction defect is present? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.23-1:** *Practice* **Tracing D**. *What type of conduction defect is present? *\n\n**ANSWER to Tracing D:** There is sinus rhythm with QRS widening. There is a PAC \\(*the 4 beat occurs early*\\). QRS morphology is *not* consistent with either RBBB or LBBB in *each* of the 3 key leads. That is — the *negative* QS complex in lead V1 is consistent with LBBB — but, if anything the wide terminal S waves in the tiny complexes seen in leads I and V6 are consistent with RBBB.\n\n+ By the process of elimination — we interpret the conduction defect in Figure 05.23-1 as **IVCD** \\(*Section 05.11*\\). \n+ As stated — ST–T wave morphology is difficult to interpret with IVCD because the ST *Opposition* Rule is *not* necessarily followed \\(*Section 05.14*\\). We would interpret ST-T wave changes seen here as “nonspecific”. Clinical correlation is needed to determine the likely significance of the conduction defect seen. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.24 – *Diagnosing* BBB \\+ Acute MI**\n\n\n\nDiagnosis of ischemia/infarction is *always* more challenging when there is *underlying* BBB \\(*Bundle Branch Block*\\). That said — suspicion of old or acute events will *surprisingly often* be possible.\n\n+ The goal of Sections 05.24-thru-05.29 — is to briefly review key considerations for assessing the patient with a conduction defect for possible ischemia/infarction. \n\n \n\n**05.25 – *Begin* with the ST Opposition Rule**\n\nWhile *not* infallible, the ***ST opposition* rule** \\(*Sections 05.14, 05.15*\\) — is a good place to start when assessing patients with RBBB or LBBB for *possible* ischemia/infarction. In **Figure 05.25-1** — we reproduce the ST-T wave changes to look for:\n\n+ Normally with **LBBB**/**RBBB** — the **ST-T wave** will be ***oppositely* directed** to the ***last* QRS deflection** in the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*leads I,V1,V6*\\). \n+ NOTE: With **IVCD** — the *ST opposition *rule does *not* consistently work \\(*reliability for ischemia/infarction is more limited*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.25-1:** The *expected* ST-T wave response to either *typical* RBBB or *typical* LBBB is ***“ST opposition”***. That is *— *the ST segment *and* T wave should be ***oppositely *directed **to the ***last* QRS deflection** \\(*red and yellow arrows*\\) in *each* of the 3 *KEY* leads \\(*= leads I,V1,V6*\\). Deviation from this pattern is abnormal *— *and indicates a ***primary*** \\(1°\\)** ST-T wave change** \\(*that suggests ischemia *or* infarction*\\).\n\n**05.26 – RBBB: *You Can See Q Waves\\!***\n\nClinically — it will usually be *easier* to diagnose ischemia/infarction when there is *underlying* **RBBB** than when there is LBBB. This is because RBBB does *not* alter the *initial* direction of septal depolarization as LBBB does \\(*Section 05.7*\\).\n\n+ As the *initial* part of the **Q**RS complex — **Q waves** are written at an *early* point during the process of ventricular activation. Because the conduction defect of **RBBB** does *not* alter the *left-to-right* direction of *normal* septal activation \\(*since the right bundle branch goes down the right side of the septum*\\) — the presence of RBBB will usually *not* prevent inscription of Q waves. This is in contrast to LBBB that *does* change the direction of *initial* septal activation \\(*Section 05.28*\\). ***KEY* Point:** Much \\(*most*\\) of the time — You *can* see infarction Q waves even when *complete* RBBB is present \\(Figure 05.26-1\\). You may or may not see acute changes. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.26-1:** Sinus tachycardia with ***complete* RBBB**. *Despite* RBBB — **Q waves** *are* seen in leads II,III,aVF; and V5,V6. This suggests ***inferolateral* infarction** has occurred at *some* point in the past. ST-T wave appearance suggests that the infarct is *less* likely to be acute \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.27 –* Underlying *RBBB: *How to Diagnose Acute MI?***\n\nAs stated in Section 05.24 — Diagnosis of ischemia/infarction is *always* more challenging when there is *underlying* BBB. This is because the typical *secondary* ST-T wave changes that result from BBB \\(Figure 05.25-1\\) — may *mask* ST-T wave changes due to ischemia/infarction. That said — it is important to *carefully* scrutinize the ECG, because chronic \\(*and even acute*\\) changes may at times be seen.\n\n+ Realize that it will always be more difficult to diagnose ischemia/infarction with LBBB than with RBBB. But — sometimes you’ll be surprised\\! \\(*as we illustrate in Section 05.29*\\). \n\n \n\nConsider the case of ***complete* RBBB** seen in **Figure 05.27**:\n\n+ The rhythm in Figure 05.27 is regular and the QRS complex is wide. Although we do *not* see upright P waves in lead II — the *mechanism* of this rhythm is clearly ***supraventricular*** — as evidenced by upright P waves with *fixed* PR interval that are seen to *regularly* occur in *simultaneously* recorded leads V1,V2,V3. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.27-1:** *Supraventricular* rhythm with ***complete* RBBB**. *Despite* RBBB — there is evidence of infarction that may be acute \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Analysis of the ECG in Figure 05.27-1:** Although *uncertain* about the precise mechanism of this rhythm — *unmistakable* P waves in *simultaneously* recorded leads V1,V2,V3 define the rhythm to be supraventricular. Perhaps artifact undulations in the baseline of lead II prevent sinus P waves from being seen or perhaps this is a *low atrial* rhythm? *Regardless* — We proceed by assessing the *reason* for QRS widening according to the **Algorithm** put forth at the beginning of this Section on BBB \\(Figure 05.2-1\\).\n\n+ A predominantly *upright* wide QR complex is seen in lead V1. This qualifies as an **RBBB* “equivalent” *pattern** \\(*Section 05.16*\\). \n+ The diagnosis of ***complete* RBBB** is secured by noting the presence of wide terminal S waves in *both* leads I and V6. \n+ **Q waves** — are seen in several leads of this tracing. The q wave in lead I is small, and of uncertain significance. However, the qrS pattern in lead aVL is distinctly abnormal and highly suggestive of lateral infarction. In addition — the **QR pattern** in** lead V1** in the setting of RBBB is virtually diagnostic of prior anterior \\(*or anteroseptal*\\) infaction. \n+ **ST-T waves** — are *not* normal for RBBB. Although the small amplitude upright T wave in lead I is consistent with the **ST *opposition* rule** \\(Fig. 05.25-1\\) — ST depression in **lead V6** and *subtle-but-real* ST elevation in **lead V1** are *both* contrary to what one normally expects with RBBB. \n+ By the concept of ***“neighboring”* leads** — We see similar ST depression with shallow T inversion extending from V6 to V4,V5 — and ST coving with slight elevation not only in V1, but also in V2,V3. \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** *Despite* RBBB — We are strongly suspicious of previous and perhaps recent \\(*if not acute ongoing*\\) infarction in Figure 05.27-1. History and comparison with *prior* tracings would be invaluable for clarifying what is likely to be new vs old. \n\n \n\n**05.28 – *Underlying* LBBB: *How to Diagnose Acute MI?***\n\n*Special* considerations are needed to assess for ischemia/infarction when there is **LBBB**. These are highlighted in the *schematic* tracings shown in Figure 05.28-1.\n\n+ Diagnosis of **LBBB** is confirmed in **Panel A** of Fig. 05.28-1 — by the finding sinus rhythm with QRS widening showing a *negative* QRS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic *upright* R wave in leads I,V6 \\(*Section 05.6*\\). \n+ Note in this *schematic* example of ***typical* LBBB** \\(Panel A\\) — that there are QS complexes and ST elevation in leads V1,V2,V3 that simulate *anterior* infarction — and that ST-T wave depression in *lateral* leads simulates ischemia. All of these findings are commonly seen with LBBB. \n+ ***Key *Point:** There is *no* ECG evidence of ischemia/infarction in **Panel A** of Figure 05.28-1. Instead — All one can say is that there is LBBB. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.28-1:** *Schematic* illustration of *typical* LBBB \\(**Panel A**\\) — and of LBBB *with* ECG signs of *acute* STEMI \\(**Panel B**\\). \n\n***Clinical* Considerations:** The main thing one cares about in assessing a patient with **LBBB** who presents to the ED \\(*Emergency Department*\\) with ***new-onset* chest pain** — is whether there is acute coronary occlusion \\(***ST E****levation ****M****yocardial ****I****nfarction-****equivalent***\\) necessitating immediate intervention \\(*cath lab activation; angioplasty/stenting*\\).\n\n+ Overall — *less* than 5% of patients with LBBB and *new-onset* chest pain have acute coronary occlusion. Although insensitive — the finding of ***primary *ST elevation** is highly *specific* for acute coronary occlusion. This is seen in leads II,III,aVF of **Panel B** in Figure 05.28-1. \n+ Further support of likely acute coronary occlusion may be forthcoming — IF there is ***excessive* discordance**. That is — IF in leads V1,V2, or V3 you can see a clear J point where the QRS ends and the ST segment begins — and — IF the J point of the ST segment is up or down \u003e20% of QRS amplitude — then there is *excessive *discordance \\(*by the Smith-modified Sgarbossa criterion*\\). This criterion is satisfied in **lead V3** of **Panel B** \\(*J-point elevation = 6; S wave depth = 24 — *and* 6/24\u003e20%*\\). **CAVEAT** — it may be difficult to know where the J-point is if anterior ST elevation with LBBB is of *smooth* contour \\(*in which case you won’t be able to use this criterion*\\). \n\n \n\nNOTE: Debate continues as to whether the ECG finding of **LBBB** of ***uncertain* age** in a patient with *new-onset *chest pain is sufficient to justify acute cath lab activation.\n\n+ Most such patients do *not* have acute coronary occlusion. Some may have troponin elevation \\(*that satisfies the definition of acute MI*\\) — but overall, initial management of patients *without* acute ECG changes will be *similar* to that of patients admitted to the hospital with a *“rule out MI”* diagnosis. \n+ Awareness of the need to look for *primary *ST elevation and *excessive* discordance in chest pain patients with LBBB will hopefully help to identify the important minority likely to have *acute* coronary occlusion. \n\n \n\n**Analysis of *Other* Leads in Panel B:** In addition to the *excessive* discordance described above — there are findings in *other* leads in **Panel B** that *strongly* suggest *acute* ischemia/infarction \\(**Figure 05.28-2**\\):\n\n+ *How many* of these *other* findings can you identify? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.28-2:** In addition to *excessive* discordance for the ST segment in lead V3 — What *other* findings strongly suggest *acute* ischemia/infarction?\n\n**ANSWER to Panel B in Figure 05.28-2:** Assessment of the *schematic* tracing in Panel B summarizes essential points covered thus far:\n\n+ QRS morphology in the 3 *key* leads is consistent with **LBBB** \\(*upright QRS in leads I,V6; negative QRS in lead V1*\\). \n+ *Look next* at **ST *opposition*** in the 3 *key* leads. ST-T waves are *oppositely* directed to the last QRS deflection \\(*as they should be*\\) in leads I,V1,V6. \n+ There should *never* normally be *lateral *q waves with LBBB \\(*Section 05.6*\\). Finding a **Q wave** in **lead I, aVL, V5,** or **V6 **means an infarct has *at some point* occurred. Note the Q wave in leads I and aVL in Panel B. \n+ Although *not* common — ***primary* ST elevation** is the most reliable indicator of *acute* STEMI with LBBB. This is seen in leads II,III,aVF of Panel Panel B. Therefore, *despite* LBBB — the *schematic* ECG seen in Figure 05.28-2 \\(*= Panel B*\\) is ***diagnostic*** of **acute *inferior* STEMI**. \n+ In addition to *excessive* discordance for the amount of *anterior* ST elevation — there may also be *excessive* discordance for the amount of *lateral* ST depression. That said — *primary* ST elevation in the *inferior* leads of this tracing is far more reliable as an indicator of *acute* STEMI *with* LBBB. \n\n \n\n**05.29 – FIGURE 05.29-1: *Acute STEMI despite LBBB/RBBB?***\n\nWe conclude this section on assessing patients with RBBB and LBBB for ECG evidence of *acute* ischemia/infarction — with a series of 4 ECGs, beginning with the 2 tracings shown in **Figure 05.29-1**.\n\n+ *Both* of the ECGs in Figure 05.29-1 were obtained from patients with *new-onset* chest pain and *known* LBBB. Despite ***underlying* LBBB** — Is there ECG evidence of *acute* STEMI on *either* tracing? *Should the cath lab be activated?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.29-1:** ECGs obtained from 2 patients with *baseline* LBBB and *new-onset* chest pain. Is there evidence of *acute* MI in *either* tracing?\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 05.29-1:** Sinus rhythm with LBBB is present in *both* ECGs shown above. Despite Q waves in leads III,aVF; and in V1,V2,V3 — there is *no evidence* of acute STEMI in the ***Top* ECG**. Instead, ST-T waves are appropriately *opposite* \\(Figure 05.25-1\\) — and there is no excessive discordance. The Q waves that are seen in leads V1,V2,V3 are expected with LBBB, and those that are seen in leads III and aVF are *not* necessarily abnormal given the presence of this conduction defect.\n\n+ ***Bottom* ECG** — shows **LBBB** with ***acute* STEMI**\\! Note *primary* ST elevation in leads II,III,aVF; and especially in leads V5,V6.* Activate the cath lab\\!* \n\n \n\nNow consider the example of **RBBB** shown in **Figure 05.29-2**. This tracing was obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. In addition to complete RBBB — Is there *also* evidence of an *acute* STEMI?\n\n+ *How certain* are you of your diagnosis? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.29-2:** ECG obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. In addition to *complete* RBBB — Is there *also* evidence of an *acute* STEMI? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 05.29-2:** The rhythm is sinus arrhythmia. Complete RBBB is diagnosed by QRS widening with an rSR’ in V1 *plus* wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6.\n\n+ There is *subtle-but-real* ST coving and elevation in lead V1 *that should not be*. Support that this finding is real — is forthcoming from *slight-but-definite* ST segment coving and elevation in lead III \\(*and to a lesser extent in aVF*\\) — plus *reciprocal* ST depression in lead aVL. \n+ A deep Q wave is already present in lead III. \n+ We interpret this tracing as sinus arrhythmia; **RBBB**; and ***probable* acute ongoing *inferior* STEMI**. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* We suspect acute *proximal* RCA \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) occlusion, possibly with acute right ventricular MI \\(*given subtle ST elevation in lead V1 in the setting of acute inferior infarction*\\). \n\n \n\nFinally, consider the conduction defect shown in **Figure 05.29-3** — obtained from a patient with chest pain. Despite LBBB/IVCD — Is there evidence of an *acute* STEMI?\n\n+ *How certain* are you of your diagnosis? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.29-3:** ECG obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. In addition to the conduction defect — Is there *also* evidence of an *acute* STEMI? \\(*My appreciation to Ben Beuchler for allowing me to publish this ECG*\\)\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 05.29-3:** The rhythm is sinus at ~75/minute. The QRS complex is wide. Although the *anterior* precordial leads look like LBBB \\(*deep QS complexes*\\) — R wave amplitude in lead I is tiny, and there is a terminal S wave in V6. Our preference would be to call the conduction defect = **“IVCD”** \\(*IntraVentricular Conduction Defect*\\) — though we would accept *either* IVCD or LBBB as correct interpretations. In either case — the anterior QS complexes seen are *not* diagnostic of prior infarction given the conduction defect.\n\n+ Regardless of the terminology used \\(*LBBB or IVCD*\\) — the important clinical point is that interpretation of acute ischemia/infarction is more difficult in the setting of this type of conduction defect. Thus, the ST segment elevation seen in leads V1-through-V4 of Figure 05.29-3 is *not* a reliable predictor of acute anterior infarction, since LBBB *commonly* manifests anterior ST elevation comparable in shape and amount to that seen here. \n+ On the other hand — there should *not* be **ST elevation** in the *inferior* leads \\(**Figure 05.29-4**\\). Note J-point ST elevation is present in *each* of the inferior leads \\(*red arrows in blow-up inserts of* Fig. 05.29-4\\). In support that this inferior ST elevation is real — is *mirror-image* shape ***reciprocal* ST depression** in **lead aVL** \\(*red circle*\\). In addition — it looks like a Q wave has already formed in lead aVL. Therefore — this ECG strongly suggests *acute* inferior STEMI *despite* the presence of *underlying* LBBB/IVCD. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.29-4:** Addition of *blow-up* inserts to Figure 05.29-3, from this patient with chest pain. We would accept *either* **IVCD** or **LBBB** as explanations for the conduction defect. While no conclusions can be drawn from the ST elevation seen in anterior precordial leads — ***acute* STEMI** *can* be diagnosed from the ST elevation seen in *each* of the inferior leads \\(*red arrows*\\) with a Q wave and mirror-image *reciprocal* ST-T wave changes in lead aVL \\(*See text*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**05.30 – *Diagnosing* BBB \\+ LVH**\n\n\n\nECG Diagnosis of ventricular chamber enlargement becomes ***difficult*** in the presence of ***conduction* defects** \\(*RBBB, LBBB, IVCD*\\). Criteria for LVH/RVH are based on the *normal* sequence and progression of ventricular activation. All of this *changes* in the presence of bundle branch block.\n\n+ Instead of *near-simultaneous* left and right ventricular activation — there will be *delay* in activation of that part \\(*or those parts*\\) of the ventricles served by the nonfunctioning conduction fascicle\\(s\\). This alteration in time sequence of the *relative* contribution of left and right ventricular forces *invalidates* numeric and morphologic criteria for chamber enlargement that were derived during sinus rhythm with *intact* ventricular conduction. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** *Traditional* ECG criteria for assessment of *ventricular* chamber enlargement should *not* be used when there is BBB/IVCD. One *never* quite knows how much of the increase in QRS amplitude seen is a result of ventricular hypertrophy vs scarring, prior infarction *and/or* alteration in sequence \\(*and therefore relative contribution*\\) of ventricular depolarization forces.\n\n+ On the other hand — **criteria** for **LAA/RAA** are ***unchanged*** by BBB/IVCD \\(*Sections 08.14-through-08.22*\\). \n+ Clinically — IF you really need to know about atrial or ventricular chamber dimensions — *Get an Echocardiogram\\!* \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** What follows in Sections 05.31 and 05.32 constitutes *advanced* material that may be ***Beyond-the-Core*** for the usual provider. We accept a preference by some to *simplify* ECG interpretation and *skip* the step of assessing ventricular enlargement when there is BBB because of the difficulty validating ECG criteria in the presence of conduction defects.\n\n+ That said, for those with an interest in going *Beyond-the-Core* — *Read on\\!* There *are* ways with *high* reliability to diagnose *probable* LVH *despite* the presence of LBBB or RBBB. \n\n \n\n**05.31 – LBBB: *What Criteria to Use for LVH/RVH?***\n\nMost patients with **LBBB** have *underlying *heart disease**.** IF there is *longterm *hypertension, cardiomyopathy or heart failure *and* LBBB — the prevalence of **LVH** is **~80%**, even *before* one looks at the ECG.\n\n+ The probability that a patient with LBBB has LVH goes up to **\u003e90%** — IF ***with* LBBB** there are **very *deep *S waves** \\(*≥25-30mm*\\) in **V1,V2** or **V3** \\(Figure 05.31-1\\). \n+ The likelihood of LBBB *plus* LVH also increases IF the patient has **LAA** \\(*Left Atrial Abnormality*\\) — as evidenced by a deep *negative* component to the P wave in lead V1. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.31-1:** Sinus rhythm with **LBBB** plus ***probable* LVH** because: **i\\)** the deep *negative* component to the P wave in lead V1 suggests **LAA** \\(*circle*\\) and **ii\\)** the **S wave** in **lead V2** is ***very* deep** \\(*\u003e25mm*\\). NOTE: *Either* LAA *or* the deep S wave in V1,V2,V3 *alone* would have been enough to increase likelihood of LVH.\n\n***Semantic *Point:** We favor use of the terminology, ***“probable” *LVH** — for the ECG picture seen in Figure 05.31-1, in which there is LBBB *plus* a *very* deep S wave in lead V2. Although statistical likelihood that this patient has LVH is *at least* 90% \\(*actually more since there is also LAA*\\) — the ECG diagnosis of “LVH” is based more on *prevalence* than on specific ECG voltage criteria. Use of the modifier *“probable”* acknowledges the uncertainties of diagnosing LVH in the presence of this conduction defect.\n\n+ ***How Deep the S Wave?*** Note that we *cannot* tell from Figure 05.31-1 how deep the S wave in lead V3 would be — since the *bottom* of the S wave in this lead has been cut off. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Notes:** Consider the following additional points:\n\n+ The presence of **LBBB** may mask and mimic other conditions. We’ve already discussed *special* considerations for assessing ischemia/infarction with LBBB \\(*Section 05.28*\\). For example — *despite* the QS complex in leads V1,V2,V3 of Figure 05.31-1 — We can *not* diagnose prior *anterior* infarction. This is because the patient has ***complete* LBBB**. Anterior precordial QS complexes with poor R wave progression are an *expected* accompaniment of *complete* LBBB \\(*Section 05.8*\\). \n+ In addition — We **can *not* comment** on the possibility of **LV “strain”** in the presence of LBBB. As highlighted by the ST *Opposition* Rule \\(*Section 05.25*\\) — *lateral* ST-T wave depression is an *expected* finding in LBBB. Its presence or absence says nothing about whether or not there is associated LV “strain”. Thus, even though we would interpret the ECG in Figure 05.31-1 as suggestive of *probable* LVH \\(*because of the deep S in V2 plus LAA*\\) — the ST-T depression seen in leads I,aVL,V5,V6 of this tracing is of *no* support to our interpretation. All we can say is, “LBBB with probable LVH”. \n+ Finally — Realize that it is virtually *impossible* to ***diagnose* RVH** when there is **LBBB**. The LBBB simply masks right ventricular events. \n\n \n\n**05.32 – RBBB: *What Criteria to Use for LVH/RVH?***\n\nECG diagnosis of ventricular chamber enlargement is equally challenging when there is **RBBB**. Once again — difficulty arises because the *altered* sequence of ventricular activation leaves us *uncertain* as to how much any increase in QRS amplitude might be due to ventricular hypertrophy vs delay \\(*and therefore nonopposition*\\) of *right* ventricular depolarization forces. Realizing the imperfection inherent with *any* proposed ECG criteria for chamber enlargement when there is BBB — We make the following points:\n\n+ ***Complete* RBBB** is a ***terminal* delay** \\(*Sections 05.4; 05.5*\\). As such — it does *not* affect the initial parts of ventricular activation \\(*during which time the septum and then left ventricle are activated*\\). As a result — the process of LV activation is virtually intact when there is RBBB with the exception that the larger left ventricle will *no longer* be opposed by smaller RV forces that are delayed. ***Bottom* Line:** ECG *voltage* criteria for LVH in the presence of *complete* RBBB are probably *not* that different in certain leads compared to voltage criteria when there is no conduction defect. \n+ ***Suspect* LVH** \\(*despite* RBBB\\) — IF the R wave in **lead aVL** is ≥12, or the R wave in **lead V5** or **V6** is ≥25. \n+ *Depth* of the S wave in leads V1,V2 is *no longer* of assistance for assessing LVH when there is RBBB — because the rSR’ in lead V1 essentially *precludes* S wave formation. \n\n \n\nConsider the ECG in **Figure 05.32-1**. There is a low atrial rhythm with QRS widening consistent with ***complete* RBBB** \\(*rSR’ in V1; wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6*\\).\n\n+ Is there ECG evidence of ventricular enlargement in Figure 05.32-1? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.32-1:** Low atrial rhythm with ***complete* RBBB**. Is there ECG evidence of ventricular enlargement? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 05:32-1:** ECG criteria for the diagnosis of LVH are covered in detail in Sections 08.1-through-0.8.13. S wave depth typically increases in leads V1,V2 with LVH — reflecting an increase in LV forces moving *away* from these *right-sided* leads. That said — the presence of *complete* RBBB in Figure 05.32-1 *negates* formation of S waves in leads V1,V2. *Other* leads must therefore be used to assess the possibility of LVH.\n\n+ R wave amplitude is *not* increased in leads V5,V6 of Figure 05.32-1. \n+ On the other hand — the R wave in lead aVL *does* attain *at least* 12mm in height, and therefore satisfies criteria for ***probable* LVH** in this patient with RBBB. \n+ NOTE: We qualify our assessment in Figure 05.32-1 with the term, ***“probable”* LVH** — to acknowledge *reduced* specificity of voltage criteria for LVH in the presence of *complete* RBBB. We simply don’t know how much of the increase in R wave amplitude in aVL is due to anatomic LV enlargement vs *nonopposition* of LV depolarization forces due to the conduction defect. \n\n \n\n**Is there RVH in Figure 05.32-1?** By definition — ECG diagnosis of RVH in the presence of RBBB is problematic. This is because the presence of this conduction defect totally *changes* the sequence and nature of RV depolarization. RV depolarization with RBBB is *delayed* and *unopposed* by LV depolarization that will usually be complete by the time the activation wavefront finally makes its way into the right ventricle. As a result — the tiny right ventricle may sometimes generate a surprisingly *tall* R’ deflection in lead V1 \\(*because there no longer is opposition from LV forces*\\). ***KEY* Point:** The height of the R’ deflection in lead V1 with complete RBBB is *not* necessarily related to the size/thickness of the right ventricle.\n\n+ Realize that *some* electrocardiographers cite R’ amplitude of \u003e10mm \\(*or \u003e15mm*\\) in lead V1 as a criterion for diagnosing RVH in the presence of RBBB. We are *not* in favor of this practice — because it will result in false positive diagnosis of RVH in many cases. \n+ ***Our* Preference** — is to ***undercall* RVH** in the presence of **RBBB**. We generally do *not* indicate *“probable RVH”* in the setting of RBBB *unless* in addition to a very tall R’ component in lead V1 \\(*of \u003e10-15mm*\\) — there is *also* RAA \\(*Right Atrial Abnormality*\\) in a patient *known* to have longstanding pulmonary disease. ***BOTTOM* Line:** While we acknowledge that some interpreters may say RVH is present in Figure 05.32-1 because of the tall R’ component in lead V1 — We would *not* do so because: **i\\)** *No* history of pulmonary disease is given; and **ii\\)** there is *no* sign of RAA. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.33 – *Brugada* Syndrome**\n\n\n\nFirst described in 1992 — the ***Brugada *Syndrome** is important to recognize because of an associated very ***high* risk** of ***sudden* death** in otherwise healthy young or middle-aged adults who have structurally normal hearts.\n\n+ The prevalence of Brugada Syndrome in the general population is ~1/2,000. The syndrome has become a leading cause of sudden death in young adults \\(*under 40 years of age*\\). \n+ Given heightened awareness and recent *increased* attention directed toward early recognition — We suspect the estimated prevalence for Brugada syndrome will continue to increase in the years-to-come. \n\n \n\n**05.34 – ECG Recognition: *Distinction Between Type I and II ***\n\nDistinction is made between 2 types of Brugada ECG patterns:\n\n+ **Type I** \\(*seen in ***Panel A*** of *Figure 05.34-1**\\)** — is ***diagnostic*** of Brugada Syndrome — because it shows ≥2mm coved ST elevation with *sharp* downslope *plus* T wave inversion in ≥2 *anterior* leads. *This is not RBBB*. \n+ **Type II \\(***in ***Panel B\\)** — is ***not* diagnostic** of Brugada Syndrome — *unless* the *saddleback* anterior ST elevation with *positive* T wave \\(*seen here in leads V2,V3*\\) at some time later *converts* to a Type I tracing. Most often — this *concave up* ST elevation is due to **benign *early* repolarization** \\(*assuming no syncope, arrhythmia or familial history of sudden death at an early age*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.34-1:** Leads V1,V2 in **Panel A** are *diagnostic* of Brugada Syndrome. The *saddleback* pattern in leads V2,V3 of **Panel B** is not.\n\n**CAVEAT:** Type I or Type II Brugada ECG patterns may be induced by a variety of factors. A partial list includes the following:\n\n+ *Certain* drugs \\(*antiarrhythmics; calcium channel blockers; β-blockers; antianginals; psychotropic medications; alcohol; cocaine; other drugs*\\). \n+ Acute febrile illness. \n+ Variations in autonomic tone. \n+ Hypothermia. \n+ Electrolyte imbalance \\(*hypokalemia*\\). \n+ Ischemia/infarction. \n+ Cardioversion/defibrillation. \n+ Bradycardia. \n+ *Repositioning* precordial leads \\(*recording leads V1,V2 from the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Whether clinical implications of a transient *induced* Brugada pattern \\(*Type I or Type II ECG*\\) are the same as with its spontaneous occurrence is uncertain — and probably depends on *associated* clinical parameters. Thus, *transient* induction of a Type II ECG pattern would seem *less* likely to be important if only briefly seen during acute febrile illness in an otherwise healthy young adult with negative family history. In contrast — induction of *longer-lasting* Type I ECG changes in an older patient with syncope and positive family history is unquestionably of great concern. Definitive answers regarding clinical implications have not yet been worked out for all situations — so judgment is needed in clinical decision-making.\n\n**05.35 –* WHAT to DO? - when a Brugada Pattern is Found? ***\n\nThe clinical question that arises is the following: ***“What to do?”*** — IF you encounter a patient with a Type I or Type II tracing?\n\n+ Patients found to have a **Type I ECG** \\(*even if asymptomatic*\\) — should probably be referred to a cardiologist. **EP \\(***ElectroPhysiologic*\\) **study** is clearly indicated when there are symptoms \\(*seizure; syncope or presyncope; arrhythmia*\\) or for positive family history of sudden death at an early age \\(*below 50*\\). An **ICD** \\(*Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator*\\) is indicated IF the patient has *inducible* VT \\(**Figure 05.35-1**\\). \n+ Follow-up with a *knowledgeable* primary care clinician \\(*but without necessarily referring to cardiology*\\) may be appropriate — IF a *non-diagnostic* pattern is seen in an otherwise healthy adult with normal exam and *negative* family history \\(**Figure 05.35-2**\\). \n+ ***IF in doubt*** about *What to Do?* for a patient you encounter who has a *Brugada-type* ECG — it is prudent to err on the side of caution. This entails consulting a clinician *experienced* in diagnosis and management of Brugada syndrome, its variants and its mimics. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.35-1:** ECG obtained from a young adult with syncope. Even without a positive family history for sudden death at an early age — the **Type I *Brugada* pattern** seen here in leads V1,V2 is enough to justify *prompt* referral to an EP \\(*ElectroPhysiology*\\) cardiologist for consideration of ICD placement. Note J-point ST elevation of 2-3mm in lead V1 and more than 5mm in V2 — followed by convincingly *steep* ST downslope into *inverted* T waves \\(*comparable to* Panel A *in* Fig. 05.34-1\\). This **ECG** is ***diagnostic*** for ***Brugada* Syndrome**.\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.35-2:** ECG obtained from an *asymptomatic* young adult. An rSr’ pattern is seen in lead V1 with *saddleback* ST elevation in lead V2. This ECG is consistent with a **Type II Brugada pattern**. Although more than is usually seen with simple *incomplete* RBBB or early repolarization — the ECG pattern in this figure is ***not* diagnostic** of Brugada syndrome. Referral and ICD placement are *not* necessarily needed — especially if this asymptomatic young adult has a *negative* family history. ***Bottom* Line:** Judgment and clinical correlation are needed for optimal evaluation and management. *Not all answers are yet in*. Each case should be individualized \\(*See text*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**05.36 – WPW \\(*Wolff-Parkinson-White*\\)**\n\n\n\nIn the setting of normal sinus rhythm — the *only* exception to the *simplified* **Algorithm** for assessment of ***QRS Widening*** \\(*Section 05.2*\\) — is the ***W****olff-****P****arkinson-****W****hite* \\(*WPW*\\) **Syndrome**.\n\n+ Although admittedly uncommon \\(*~2 per 1,000 in the general population*\\) — WPW occurs just often enough to cause problems for the unwary. The ***importance*** of **WPW** is twofold: **i\\)** It is ***“the great mimic”*** — and may simulate other conditions \\(*such as ischemia/infarction, hypertrophy and/or conduction defects*\\) — IF it is *not* recognized; and **ii\\)** The presence of one or more accessory pathways ***predisposes*** the patient to a number of potentially important ***cardiac* arrhythmias**. \n\n \n\n**05.37 – WPW: *Pathophysiology / ECG Recognition***\n\nWPW — is a syndrome in which one or more *accessory* pathways exist that allow an *alternate* route for transmission of the electrical impulse from atria to ventricles. Thus, with **WPW** — sinus impulses ***bypass*** the AV node via an **AP** \\(***A****ccessory ****P****athway*\\) — and therefore arrive *early* in the ventricles \\(**Panel A*** in *Figure 05.37-1\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.37-1:** With WPW — impulses *bypass* the AV node via AP conduction. Although the **AP** shown in **Panel A** is ***right-sided*** — it could be left-sided, anterior or posterior and at times there is *more* than a single AP. The **3 ECG signs** of **WPW** are seen in **Panel B** — **i\\)** a ***delta* wave** \\(*which may be positive or negative*\\); **ii\\) QRS widening**; and **iii\\)** a ***short* PR interval** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ECG Recognition of WPW:** It is usually easy to recognize WPW on a baseline 12-lead ECG when conduction *completely* utilizes the **AP** \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\). There are **3 ECG features** to look for \\(**Panel B*** in *Figure 05.37-1\\):\n\n+ *Delta* waves. \n+ A *short* PR interval. \n+ QRS widening. \n\n \n\n***Delta* Wave:** The ***delta* wave** is recognized as a distortion of the *initial* portion of the QRS complex. It is due to the fact that the electrical impulse *bypasses* the AV node — and arrives at the ventricles *directly* via conduction over the accessory pathway.\n\n+ Delta waves may be upright \\(*positive*\\) or downward \\(*negative*\\) — depending on where in the heart the AP is located. When delta waves are negative — they may simulate the Q wave of myocardial infarction \\(Panel B* in *Fig. 05.37-1\\): \n+ Even when conduction is entirely over the AP — delta waves will *not* always be seen in every lead. Moreover, delta waves may come and go — since conduction over the AP may be intermittent. At times — conduction may *simultaneously* occur over both the normal and accessory pathway. When this happens — the ECG characteristics of WPW may be subtle because the contribution from conduction over the normal AV nodal pathway may predominate \\(*and thereby mask*\\) ECG features of pre-excitation. \n\n \n\n***Short* PR Interval:** The reason the **PR interval** is ***short*** with WPW — is that the AV node is bypassed. With normal conduction in sinus rhythm — the electrical impulse *slows down* as it passes through the AV node on its way to the ventricles. As a result — most of the PR interval normally consists of the time it takes for the impulse to traverse the AV node. The electrical impulse arrives at the ventricles *sooner* with WPW because the usual relative *delay* that occurs when passing through the AV node is *avoided* by conduction over the AP.\n\n**QRS Widening:** The **QRS *widens*** with **WPW** — because *after* the impulse arrives at the ventricles \\(*via conduction over the AP*\\) — it must travel over *nonspecialized* myocardial tissue until such time that it attains whatever distal portion of the conduction system that has *not* yet depolarized. Thus the delta wave may extend for 0.04 second or more \\(*reflecting slow conduction over nonspecialized myocardial tissue*\\). When the delta wave deflection is *added* to the rest of the QRS complex — the result is a *widened* complex.\n\n***Bottom* Line *Regarding* ECG Recognition:** Many variations exist on the above theme. Remember the following:\n\n+ WPW is *not* common in the general population — but it *does* occur \\(*and you will see it*\\)\\! \n+ When a patient with WPW is conducting over their accessory pathway — you can ***diagnose* WPW** by ***recognition*** of the following **3 ECG features** in at least *several* of the 12 leads of an ECG: **i\\)** QRS widening; **ii\\)** a *delta* wave; and iii\\) a *short* PR interval. \n+ **Preexcitation** \\(ie, *WPW conduction over an AP*\\) can be intermittent. There may be no indication on ECG that a patient has WPW if conduction is entirely \\(*or almost entirely*\\) over the normal AV nodal pathway at the time the tracing is recorded. \n\n \n\n**05.38 – WPW: *The “Great Mimic” of other Conditions***\n\nAs already emphasized — an essential reason for recognizing WPW is so that it is *not* confused with *other* conditions. This point is well illustrated by the *schematic* tracing shown in **Figure 05.38-1**:\n\n+ Note in Fig. 05.38-1 — that *delta* waves are *not* always present in all leads. For example, they are completely *missing* in leads I,aVL and V4,V5 of Figure 05.38-1. \n+ *Negative* delta waves are present in leads II,III,aVF and *simulate* inferior infarction. \n+ The tall R wave in lead V1 *simulates* RBBB. \n+ The tall, monophasic R wave in lead V6 *simulates* LBBB. \n+ ST-T wave depression in lead V6 *simulates* ischemia. \n\n \n\n\n\n**BOTTOM Line:** It is *easy* to *overlook* WPW if one does not *routinely* use a *Systematic* Approach. This is especially true IF — conduction goes down *both* the AP and the normal AV nodal pathway at the *same* time \\(*in which case the delta wave may be subtle* and *the QRS may be no more than minimally widened*\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.38-1:** *Schematic* example of **WPW**. Known as **the *great* “mimic”** — the ECG picture of WPW may resemble infarction, ischemia, chamber enlargement *and/or *bundle branch block — as it does here \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.39 – FIGURE 05.39-1: *Recognizing WPW on a 12-Lead ***\n\nPrimary care care and emergency clinicians will *not* always have the luxury of a baseline 12-lead ECG at the time a patient with *WPW-associated* tachycardia is initially seen. However, with luck — a ***baseline* 12-lead ECG** with ***telltale* features** of **WPW** may occasionally be found in the patient’s chart — thereby *confirming* the diagnosis. We show such a tracing with ***overt* WPW** in **Figure 05-39-1**. Note the following:\n\n+ Suggestion of **WPW** is readily apparent from initial inspection of **lead II** — in which all 3 ECG features are seen: **i\\)** short PR interval;** ii\\)** *delta* wave \\(*red arrow*\\); and QRS widening. The diagnosis of WPW is *confirmed* by recognition of *definite* delta waves in *other* leads \\(*III,aVF; V4,V5,V6*\\). \n+ ***Negative* delta waves** are seen in **leads aVR** and **aVL** \\(*blue arrows*\\). The negative delta wave in lead aVL may simulate high lateral infarction. \n+ **NOTE:** Delta waves are *not* prominent in every lead. The delta wave is subtle in leads I and V2 — and completely *absent* in lead V1. The QRS complex does *not* appear wide in these leads. Depending on the *relative* contribution from normal AV nodal pathway conduction and AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\) conduction — more or less leads may manifest delta waves, and the QRS complex may be obviously wide or only minimally prolonged. \n+ Clinically — One can* not* diagnose LVH, ischemia or infarction from the ECG shown in Figure 05.39-1 — *despite* the tall inferior R waves, deep Q wave in lead aVL, and ST-T wave changes in V1,V2,V3 — since the patient has WPW. \n\n \n\n**Bottom Line:** It should be apparent from Figure 05.39-1 that the diagnosis of WPW could be *easily* overlooked IF one was not systematic in their approach. At *first* glance — the QRS complex does *not* look overly wide. That said — there is no mistaking the **lead II** findings of a ***short* PR interval** with **upward *delta* wave** \\(*red arrow*\\) — that when *added* to the remaining portion of the QRS results in **QRS widening**. Confirmation of WPW is forthcoming from recognition of delta waves in most \\(*but not all*\\) of the *other* leads on the tracing.\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.39-1:** 12-lead ECG showing sinus rhythm with WPW. Note the short PR, delta wave and QRS widening in **lead II** \\(*red arrow*\\). Delta waves are *negative* in leads aVR and aVL \\(*blue arrows*\\). Delta waves are subtle in leads I,V2 and no delta wave at all is seen in lead V1 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**05.40 – FIGURE 05.40-1: *Recognizing WPW ***\n\nAnother 12-lead ECG example of WPW is provided below in **Figure 05.40-1**. It would be easy to misdiagnose this tracing as showing LVH *and/or* anterior infarction — IF one failed to recognize the *short* PR interval with *delta* waves in many leads \\(*red arrows*\\).\n\n+ The purpose of our ***sequential* Systematic Approach** to ECG interpretation — is to *avoid* overlooking entities such as WPW that is *easy* to do if your attention jumps first to QRS morphology *before* assessing intervals. As emphasized in our **ECG Crib Sheet** \\(*Section 00.6.3*\\) — the **3 Intervals** \\(*PR/QRS/QT*\\) should be assessed *early* in the process. Doing so should alert you to the *short* PR interval and *wide* QRS complex in Figure 05.40-1. We need to determine the **cause** of these ***abnormal* intervals** *before* proceeding further. *Knowing* the patient has WPW tells us that assessment for infarction, ischemia, conduction defects and chamber enlargement will *not* be reliable. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.40-1:** 12-lead ECG showing sinus rhythm with a *short* PR interval. The QRS is wide and *delta* waves are present in multiple leads \\(*arrows*\\). Note *negative* delta waves in V1,V2,V3 *simulate* anterior infarction. Increased QRS amplitude in V5,V6 simulates LVH. QRS morphology in leads I,V1,V6 *simulates* LBBB. This is **WPW**.\n\n\n\n\n\n**05.41 – FIGURE 05.41-1: *Atypical RBBB or WPW?***\n\nWe present one more 12-lead ECG to illustrate the challenge of distinguishing between bundle branch block and WPW \\(**Figure 05.41-1**\\).\n\n+ Doesn’t the upright and widened QRS complex in lead V1 of Figure 05.41-1 resemble RBBB? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.41-1:** QRS widening with an upright QRS complex in lead V1. What is this due to? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.41-1:** As stated — there is obvious QRS widening in this tracing. Approaching this ECG systematically — the QRS complex in lead II appears to begin *very soon* after completion of the P wave in this lead. Admittedly — the PR interval does not seem overly short in every lead on this tracing. However, *suspicion* of a *short* PR interval should alert you to look closer at the QRS complex:\n\n+ Slurring on the upstroke of the *initial* part of the QRS complex is present in a number of leads \\(*leads II, aVF, and V1-thru-V6*\\). These are ***delta* waves** — and they confirm that the reason for QRS widening is **WPW**. There is no RBBB. \n+ As we will see in Section 10 when we discuss **LIST \\#6** \\(*Section 10.47*\\) — WPW is one of the important causes of a tall R wave in lead V1. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.42 – WPW Addendum \\#1: *How to Localize the AP?***\n\n\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** Delta wave morphology and orientation on 12-lead ECG may assist in surprisingly *accurate* localization of the AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\) in the patient with WPW. This is of more than academic interest to the EP cardiologist — as it facilitates and *expedites* localization of the AP during EP \\(*ElectroPhysiology*\\) study. In addition — it helps in planning the procedure as well as in patient discussion, since risks of catheter ablation and likely success rates are based in part on localization of the AP.\n\n+ We emphasize that ECG localization of the AP is an ***advanced* topic** that clearly extends beyond clinical needs of the non-EP-cardiologist. Practically speaking — it suffices to recognize WPW and IF there is need for referral. That said — ECG localization of the AP is a fascinating topic that is not necessarily difficult if certain basic parameters are followed. \n+ ***The choice is YOURS\\!*** Feel free to *SKIP OVER* this **Addendum \\#1** on *localizing* the AP with WPW \\(*Sections 05.42-thru-05.46*\\) — if you prefer *not* to get into this aspect of ECG interpretation. I avoided this topic for the first 30 years of my academic career — and my ECG interpretation ability was none the worse for it. BUT if you’d like to be “let in” on a most *user-friendly* approach I’ve encountered for AP localization — *Read on\\!* I wager you’ll be *pleasantly* surprised at how *easy* approximate AP localization can be from a few well spent seconds analyzing the 12-lead ECG using the *step-by-step* approach I outline below \\(*Clinical examples discussed in Sections 05.44, 05.45, and 05.46*\\). \n\n \n\nMy ***Suggested* Approach** is based on my synthesis of material primarily from the following 2 references:\n\n+ Das MK, Zipes DP: *Electrocardiography of Arrhythmias *—* A Comprehensive Review* \\(*ePub book*\\). Elsevier-Saunders, Philadelphia, 2012. \n+ Fitzpatrick AP Gonzales RP Scheinman MM, et al: *Algorithm for the Localization of Accessory Atrioventricular Connections Using a Baseline Electrocardiogram*. J Am Coll Cardiol 23:107-116, 1994. \n\n \n\n**05.43 – WPW: *The Basics of AP Localization***\n\nECG localization of the AP is *not* perfect. Accuracy of ECG localization is clearly *suboptimal* if there is less than maximum preexcitation — as may occur when the QRS is minimally widened because a substantial portion of ventricular activation is occurring by transmission of the impulse over the normal AV nodal pathway.\n\n+ ***Approximate* distribution** of **AP sites** is the following: **i\\)** Lateral \\(*Left Ventricular*\\) Free Wall — ~50% of APs; **ii\\)** Right or Left *PosteroSeptal* Area — ~20%; **iii\\)** RV \\(*Right Ventricular*\\) Free Wall — ~20%; and **iv\\)** *AnteroSeptal* Area — ~10%. \n+ On occasion — *more* than a single AP may be present in a given patient. Together with variation in the *relative* amount of AP vs normal pathway conduction — this may account for *changing* delta wave morphology that can sometimes be seen from one ECG to the next in a given patient. \n+ As a general rule — IF the ***delta* wave** \\(*first ~40msec of the QRS*\\) is **upright** \\(*positive*\\) in **lead V1** \\(*RBBB pattern*\\) — then there is a ***LEFT-sided* AP** \\(*as in* **Step A-1**\\). \n+ IF the ***delta* wave** is **downward** \\(*negative*\\) in **lead V1** \\(*LBBB pattern*\\) — then as a general rule there is a ***RIGHT-sided* AP** \\(*The major exception to this is when transition occurs between leads V1-to-V2 *—* as described in* **Step B-1**\\). \n\n \n\n**Step A-1: *IF the QRS in Lead V1 is UPRIGHT***\n\nWhen the QRS complex is *upright* in lead V1 — then there is a “RBBB pattern”. In this case — **transition** \\(*where the R wave becomes taller than the S wave*\\) is said to occur *before* or *by* lead V1. This defines a ***LEFT-sided* AP**. Proceed as follows:\n\n+ **Measure** the ***sum*** of ***delta wave* polarities** in the **3 *inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — giving a score of \\+1 if the delta \\(*first 40msec of the QRS*\\) is positive; 0 if the delta is isoelectric; and -1 if the delta is negative. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is \\+2 or \\+3 = ***AnteroLateral* LV *Free* Wall AP**. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is *less* than \\+2 — then the AP is *posterior*. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is -2 or -1 — and — the R wave in lead I is *at least* 0.8mV \\(*8 mm*\\) *more* than the S wave in lead I = ***PosteroSeptal* AP**. Otherwise = there is a ***PosteroLateral* LV *Free* Wall AP**. \n\n \n\n**Step A-2: *IF Transition Occurs Between Lead V1-to-V2:***\n\nIF the R wave in lead V1 is *less* than the S wave in V1 — but by lead V2 the R wave *becomes* taller than the S wave in V2 \\(ie, *IF transition occurs between V1-to-V2*\\) — then the AP could be *either* left or right-sided. Proceed as follows:\n\n+ IF the R wave in lead I is *less *than 1.0mV \\(*10 mm*\\) greater than the S wave in lead I = then there is a ***LEFT-sided* AP**. In this case — Proceed as above \\(**Step A-1**\\) for when the QRS is UPRIGHT \\(*beginning by measuring sum of delta polarity in the inferior leads to determine if the AP is anterolateral — posteroseptal — or posterolateral*\\). \n+ But IF the R wave in lead I is *at least *1.0mV \\(*10 mm*\\) more than the S wave in lead I = then there is a ***RIGHT-sided* AP**. In this case — Proceed as described in **Step B-1**. \n\n \n\n**Step B-1: *How to Tell IF the AP is RIGHT-sided?***\n\nWhen the QRS complex is downward \\(*negative*\\) in lead V1 — and — **transition** \\(*where the R wave becomes taller than the S wave*\\) occurs *after* lead V2 — then there is a ***RIGHT-sided* AP**.\n\n+ As stated above there can also be a ***RIGHT-sided* AP** — IF transition occurs *between* V1-to-V2 — and — the R wave in lead I is *at least *1.0mV \\(*10 mm*\\) more than the S wave in lead I. \n\n \n\n**Step B-2: *When the AP is RIGHT-sided:***\n\nLocalization of a *right-sided* AP will depend on ***where* transition occurs**. There are **3 possibilities**. Transition may be: **i\\)** *by* or *before* V2-to-V3 \\(**Step B-3**\\); **ii\\)** *between* V3-to-V4 \\(**Step B-4**\\); or **iii\\)** *after* V4 \\(**Step B-5**\\).\n\n**Step B-3: Right-Sided AP:* Transition by *or* before V2-to-V3:*** \n\nIF the AP is *right-sided* with transition *by* or *before* lead V2-to-V3 — then the AP is ***Septal***. To determine *which* septal area is involved — Proceed as follows:\n\n+ **Measure** the ***sum*** of ***delta wave* polarities** in the **3 *inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — giving a score of \\+1 if the delta \\(*first 40msec of the QRS*\\) is positive; 0 if the delta is isoelectric; and -1 if the delta is negative. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is -2 or -3 = ***PosteroSeptal* AP**. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is -1, 0 or \\+1 = ***MidSeptal* AP**. \n+ IF Sum of *inferior* lead Polarities is \\+2 or \\+3 = ***AnteroSeptal* AP**. \n\n \n\n**Step B-4: Right-Sided AP:* Transition between V3-to-V4:*** \n\nIF the AP is *right-sided* with transition *between* lead V3-to-V4 — then the AP is *either* septal or right ventricular free wall. To determine *which* — Proceed as follows:\n\n+ Measure ***delta wave* amplitude** \\(*first ~40msec of the QRS*\\) in **lead II**. \n+ IF the delta wave in lead II is *at least* 1.0mV \\(*10mm*\\) = ***Septal* AP**. To then find out *which* septal area is involved — Proceed as above for when transition is *between* V2-to-V3 \\(**Step B-3**\\). \n+ IF the delta wave in lead II is *less *than 1.0mV \\(*10mm*\\) = **RV* Free *Wall AP**. To determine IF the AP is located on the *anterolateral* or *posterolateral* RV Free Wall — Proceed as below for when transition is *after* V4 \\(**Step B-5**\\). \n\n \n\n**Step B-5: Right-Sided AP:* Transition after Lead V4:*** \n\nIF the AP is *right-sided* with transition *after* lead V4 — then the AP is located in the **RV *Free* Wall**. To determine IF the AP is located on the *anterolateral* or *posterolateral* RV Free Wall — Proceed as follows:\n\n+ Measure the ***delta wave* frontal axis** \\(*looking at delta wave polarity in leads I and aVF*\\). \n+ IF the delta wave frontal axis is positive \\(= *more than 0 degrees*\\) = ***Anterolateral *RV Free Wall AP**. \n+ But IF the delta wave frontal axis is negative \\(= *less than 0 degrees*\\) — then look at the R wave in lead III. \n+ IF delta wave frontal axis is *negative* — and — the R wave in lead III is net *positive* = ***AnteroLateral *RV Free Wall AP**. \n+ IF delta wave frontal axis is *negative* — and — the R wave in lead III is net *negative* = ***PosteroLateral *RV Free Wall AP**. \n\n \n\n**05.44 – FIGURE 05.44-1: *Where is the AP?***\n\nLet’s apply the above approach for AP localization to the ECG shown in **Figure 05.44-1** \\(*this ECG was previously seen in* Figure 05.40\\).*Where is the AP likely to be?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.44-1:** Sinus rhythm with WPW. *Where is the AP?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.44-1:** We begin by looking to see IF the QRS complex in lead V1 of this tracing is upright or negative:\n\n+ Since the QRS in V1 is negative — we *skip* over Step A-1. \n+ **Transition** \\(*where the R wave in precordial leads becomes taller than the S wave*\\) is *not* between V1-to-V2 — therefore we also skip over Step A-2. \n+ According to **Step B-1** — the **AP** is ***RIGHT-sided*** \\(*because the QRS is negative in V1 and transition occurs after lead V2*\\). \n+ **Transition** occurs *between* **V3-to-V4**. Therefore we skip to **Step B-4**. We are asked to measure ***delta wave* amplitude** in **lead II**. Realizing that it is *not* always easy to distinguish the precise end of slurring from the delta wave vs the point of transition to the remaining portion of the QRS — it looks like there is a *markedly* positive delta wave \\(*of at least 10mm*\\) in lead II. This suggests a ***Septal* location** for the AP. \n+ To determine the likely part of the septum that is involved — We are asked to return to **Step B-3**. Delta wave polarities are clearly positive in *each* of the inferior leads — therefore we suspect an ***AnteroSeptal* AP** location. \n\n \n\n**05.45 – FIGURE 05.45-1: *Where is the AP?***\n\nLocalize the AP for the example of WPW shown below in **Figure 05.45-1** \\(*this ECG was previously seen in* Figure 05.41-1\\).*Where is the AP likely to be?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.45-1:** Sinus rhythm with WPW. *Where is the AP?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.45-1:** We begin again by looking to see IF the QRS complex in lead V1 of Fig. 05.45-1 is upright or negative:\n\n+ Since the QRS complex in lead V1 is upright — we begin with **Step A-1**. Because the QRS is positive in lead V1 — we already know we are dealing with a ***LEFT-sided* AP**. \n+ The sum of ***delta wave* polarities** is *at least* \\+2 \\(*decidedly positive delta waves in leads II,aVF — though no more than minimally positive in III, if not isoelectric in this lead*\\). Therefore — we suspect an ***AnteroLateral* LV *Free* Wall AP**. \n\n \n\n**05.46 – FIGURE 05.46-1: *Where is the AP?***\n\nLocalize the AP for the example of WPW shown below in **Figure 05.46-1** \\(*this ECG was previously seen in* Figure 05.39-1\\).*Where is the AP likely to be?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 05.46-1:** Sinus rhythm with WPW. *Where is the AP?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.46-1:** We begin again by looking to see IF the QRS complex in lead V1 of Fig. 05.46-1 is upright or negative:\n\n+ Since the QRS complex in V1 is negative — we *skip* over Step A-1. \n+ **Transition** \\(*where the R wave in precordial leads becomes taller than the S wave*\\) is *not* between V1-to-V2 — therefore we also skip over Step A-2. \n+ According to **Step B-1** — the **AP** is ***RIGHT-sided*** \\(*because the QRS is negative in V1 and transition occurs after lead V2*\\). \n+ **Transition** occurs *between* **V2-to-V3**. Therefore we skip to **Step B-3**. We are asked to measure the sum of ***delta wave* polarities** in the inferior leads. Given that delta wave polarities are decidedly positive in *each* of the inferior leads — we suspect an ***AnteroSeptal* AP** location. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**05.47 – Addendum \\#2: *Arrhythmias with WPW***\n\n\n\nWe have already emphasized how conduction of the sinus impulse in patients with WPW may be: **i\\)** via the normal \\(*AV nodal*\\) pathway; **ii\\)** down the AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\); or **iii\\)** it may *alternate* between the two. The *same* 3 possibilities for conduction exist when a patient with WPW develops a ***supraventricular* tachyarrhythmia**. In these next few sections — we briefly review key points to consider when the patient with WPW develops an SVT \\(*SupraVentricular Tachycardia*\\).\n\n+ Patients with WPW are prone to SVT rhythms in which a ***reentry* circuit** is set up between the normal AV nodal pathway and the AP. Assuming there is no preexisting bundle branch block — whether or not the QRS complex will be wide *during* the tachycardia in a patient with WPW will depend upon whether the reentrant pathway goes *up* or *down* the AP \\(**Figure 05.47-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.47-1:** SVT pathways with WPW. Conduction of the impulse from atria to ventricles during *WPW-associated* tachycardia may either be: **i\\)** as in **Panel A** = **orthodromic** \\(*down the normal AV nodal-His-Purkinje system *—* and back up the AP*\\) — as commonly occurs with PSVT; or **ii\\)** as in **Panel B** = **antidromic** \\(*first down the AP *—* and then back up the normal pathway*\\) — as commonly occurs with AFib or AFlutter — and only rarely with PSVT. Assuming there is no underlying bundle branch block — the QRS will be *narrow* with orthodromic conduction \\(Panel A\\) and *wide* with antidromic conduction \\(Panel B\\).\n\n**05.48 – PSVT with WPW: *When the QRS During Tachycardia is Narrow***\n\nWhen PSVT occurs in a patient with WPW — the tachycardia is almost always **orthodromic** \\(*down the normal AV nodal-His-Purkinje system — and back up the AP =* **Panel A** *in *Figure 05.47-1\\).\n\n+ Because conduction goes *down* the normal AV nodal pathway — the **QRS** is ***narrow*** during the tachycardia. As a result — the usual **AV nodal blocking drugs** \\(*Verapamil-Diltiazem-β-Blockers*\\) can be used and are usually effective. \n+ A delta wave will *not* be seen during the tachycardia. The presence of WPW may only be suspected in a patient with *narrow-complex* PSVT IF an ECG showing delta waves is found in the medical chart or obtained following conversion of the tachycardia. \n+ PSVT is by far the most common tachyarrhythmia observed in patients with WPW. It is often well tolerated. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* A surprising number of patients with PSVT actually have one or more *concealed* accessory pathways. That is — a conduction pathway exists between atria and ventricles that *only* allows orthodromic \\(*but not antidromic*\\) conduction. Since forward conduction down the AP is not possible — a delta wave is *never* seen. However, ready availability of an AP reentry pathway may predispose such patients to frequent episodes of PSVT. While acute treatment considerations are similar to those for treatment of any other *narrow-complex* PSVT — awareness of this entity may lower one’s threshold for EP referral after the episode if PSVT episodes are frequent *and/or* difficult to control with medication. Ablation of the AP may be curative. \n+ *Way-Beyond-the-Core:* Taking the last *advanced* information bullet one step further — You may at times be able to *suspect* the presence of an AP in some WPW patients with *narrow* complex PSVT even without seeing a delta wave IF you see a *negative* P wave with *long* R-P interval reflecting *retrograde* conduction back to the atria during the reentrant cycle. When retrograde conduction is seen during AVNRT in a patient *without* WPW — the RP is *very* short \\(*most often seen as a notch at the tail end of the QRS complex*\\) reflecting short distance travel *within* the AV node. The RP tends to be longer \\(*negative P usually seen midway within the ST segment*\\) for a patient in whom the reentry circuit runs down the AV node and back up an AP lying outside the AV node. Technically — this type of PSVT in a patient with accessory pathways is known as **AVRT** \\(*AtrioVentricular Reciprocating Tachycardia*\\). Distinction in the ECG picture *between* AVNRT vs AVRT \\(*when an AP is present\\) *is an *advanced* concept that generally does *not* impact on acute treatment. We often will simply *not* know if a *narrow-complex* PSVT rhythm involves AV node vs AP in its reentry circuit. \n+ *Final Way-Beyond-the-Core Point:* Adenosine may *shorten* the refractory period of atrial tissue — which could initiate AFib in a *predisposed* individual. As a result — Adenosine should be used with caution in patients with *known* WPW, given *theoretic* possibility of inducing AFib \\(*which could have significant consequence in a patient with accessory pathways*\\). That said — we often will *not* know at the time treatment is needed IF the patient with a *narrow-complex* PSVT has a *concealed* AP and even if they do, giving Adenosine to such a patient will *rarely* be problematic. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line**** = *What to Remember\\!***\n\n*Most* of the time — PSVT in a patient with WPW will conduct with a *narrow* QRS complex \\(*as in ***Panel A*** in *Figure 05.47-1\\).\n\n+ Practically speaking — you do *not* have to worry in the immediate *acute* setting IF a patient with *narrow-complex* PSVT has WPW or not. Initial treatment measures are the same. These include: **i\\)** A *vagal* maneuver; and/or **ii\\)** Adenosine; and/or **iii\\)** *Other* AV nodal blocking agent \\(*Diltiazem, β-Blocker*\\). \n+ With regard to *longterm* management — awareness that a significant percentage of patients with *narrow-complex* PSVT have a *concealed* AP \\(*even when they never show overt WPW on their ECG*\\) should *lower* our threshold for EP referral if PSVT episodes recur *despite* medical therapy. \n\n \n\n**05.49 – *Very Rapid* AFib with WPW**\n\nIn contrast to the situation for PSVT with WPW — the occurrence of **AFib** in a patient with WPW *almost always* manifests a ***wide* QRS** during the tachycardia. This is because the path of conduction for AFib with WPW is almost always **antidromic** \\(*first down the AP *— *and then back up the normal pathway =* **Panel B*** in *Figure 05.47-1\\).\n\n+ Because of the short RP \\(*Refractory Period*\\) of the accessory pathway — there may be 1:1 conduction of atrial impulses \\(*at times resulting in a ventricular response that may exceed 250/minute\\!*\\). As might be anticipated — these rapid rates are *not* always well tolerated \\(*may deteriorate to VFib*\\). \n+ It is recognition of the ECG picture of ***exceedingly* rapid AFib** \\(*over 220/minute in parts of the tracing*\\) in conjunction with **QRS widening** and ***marked* variability** in regularity of the tracing that clues the clinician into the *almost certain* diagnosis of **WPW *with* very *rapid* AFib**. This is the case for the rhythm in Figure 05.49-1. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.49-1:** WPW with very *rapid* AFib. Even *without* benefit of a 12-lead ECG — an *almost certain* diagnosis of **WPW** can be made from this *single* rhythm strip because: **i\\)** there is QRS widening with *marked* irregular irregularity showing far *more* variation in rate than is seen with VT; and **ii\\)** parts of the rhythm show a rate *between* 250-300/minute, which is far *too fast* for AFib conduction over the normal AV nodal pathway. Thus, the rhythm *must be* AFib — and conduction must be *bypassing* the normal AV nodal pathway in a patient with WPW who has an AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\).\n\n***Treatment* Considerations: *WPW with Very Rapid AFib***\n\nThe importance of recognizing that the example of *very rapid* AFib seen in Figure 05.49-1 is from a patient with WPW — is that treatment considerations are very *different* than they are for the much more common usual AFib patient.\n\n+ **AV Nodal *Blocking* Drugs** — that are regularly used to treat the common form of rapid AFib are ***contraindicated***. This includes Verapamil-Diltiazem-Digoxin — and *possibly* β-Blockers. By impeding conduction down the normal AV nodal pathway — *all* of these agents may inadvertently *facilitate* forward \\(*antidromic*\\) conduction of AFib impulses down the AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\), thereby *accelerating* the rapid AFib even more. This may precipitate deterioration to VFib. \n+ Realizing that Adenosine is often used as a *diagnostic* measure during assessment of various WCT \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\) rhythms — it is best to ***avoid* Adenosine** whenever possible IF very rapid AFib *with* WPW is suspected \\(*since Adenosine may likewise accelerate AP conduction in a patient with WPW*\\). That said — the *ultra-short* half-life of Adenosine is much *less* likely to be deleterious compared to other AV nodal blocking drugs if it is inadvertently given. \n+ **Drugs of Choice:** The 3 drugs that have most commonly been recommended for antiarrhythmic treatment of ***hemodynamically* stable** very rapid AFib \\(*or AFlutter*\\) with WPW are** i\\)** Procainamide; **ii\\)** Amiodarone; and **iii\\)** Ibutilide. There are pros and cons for use of each of these agents that extent beyond the scope of this ePub on ECG interpretation. Each drug has its advocates. All in theory reduce forward transmission of impulses down the accessory pathway. ***KEY* Point:** IF at any time during the treatment process the patient becomes *hemodynamically* unstable — then cardiovert\\! \n\n \n\n**05.50 – Atrial Flutter with WPW**\n\nWhen **AFlutter** occurs in a patient with WPW — the tachyarrhythmia is also **antidromic** \\(*first down the AP *— *and then back up the normal pathway = as in* **Panel B** *of *Figure 05.47-1\\).\n\n+ As with AFib — the **QRS** is ***wide*** in **AFlutter** *with* **WPW**. There may be 1:1 AV conduction of atrial impulses \\(*so that the ventricular response may be 250-300/minute*\\)\\! \n+ Very fast AFlutter with WPW is seen even *less often* than AFib \\(*but clinical manifestations and treatment are similar*\\). \n\n \n\n**05.51 – PSVT with WPW: *When the QRS is Wide***\n\nIn *rare* instances — **PSVT** may be ***antidromic*** \\(ie, *travel first down the AP* — *and then back up the normal pathway = as occurs in* **Panel B** *of *Figure 05.47-1\\).\n\n+ In these rare instances — the **QRS** will be ***wide*** and the PSVT rhythm may be *indistinguishable* from VT. \n+ It may only be *after* conversion to sinus rhythm that “telltale” delta waves of WPW can be identified. Fortunately — the *vast* majority \\(*~95%*\\) of PSVT episodes with WPW are orthodromic \\(*with narrow QRS*\\). ***Synchronized* cardioversion** will be the usual treatment of choice for episodes of a *regular* WCT \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\) in which one suspects *antidromic* PSVT in a patient with WPW as the etiology. \n\n \n\n**05.52 – FIGURE 05.52-1: *VT or WPW? What to Do?***\n\nWe complete our discussion of arrhythmias in the patient with WPW by the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 05.52-1** — obtained from a *hemodynamically* stable young adult who presented to the ED \\(*Emergency Department*\\) with *new-onset* palpitations.\n\n+ *What is the rhythm?* What does this patient have? \n+ How should the patient be treated? \n+ Which drugs should *not* be given? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 05.52-1:** 12-lead ECG from a young adult with palpitations. What is the rhythm? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 05.52-1:** The rhythm in this *hemodynamically* stable young adult is an **irregularly *irregular* WCT** \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\). No P waves are seen in any of the 12 leads of this tracing. This defines the rhythm as **AFib**. That said — the ***ventricular* response** is ***exceedingly* rapid** \\(*attaining a rate of nearly 300/minute in some parts of the tracing*\\). In addition — there is marked *variability* in rate of the ventricular response \\(*seen best in leads aVF and V3*\\).\n\n+ This 12-lead ECG is ***virtually* diagnostic** of ***very rapid *AFib** in a patient who has **WPW**. VT \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) may at times be *slightly* irregular — but it should *not* be as *irregularly* irregular as seen here *throughout* the tracing. \n+ The *rapidity* of the rate \\(*nearly 300/minute in certain parts of the tracing*\\) — suggests AP conduction until proven otherwise \\(*Section 05.49*\\). Treatment considerations are as described in Section 05.49 \\(*IV Amiodarone, Procainamide or Ibutilide if the patient remains stable — with immediate cardioversion at the first sign of instability*\\). \n+ The patient should be referred to an EP cardiologist after resolution of the acute tachycardia for consideration of an ablative procedure that may be curative. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**06.0 – QT Interval / Torsades de Pointes**\n\n\n\n**06.1 – *How to Measure the QT***\n\nThe ***QT interval*** — is the period that extends from the *beginning* of ventricular depolarization — until the *end* of ventricular repolarization \\(**Figure 06.1-1**\\). For practical purposes, the QT is ***prolonged ***— IF it clearly measures ***more*** than **half** the **R-R interval**. The *principal* exception to this rule is when the heart rate is rapid \\(*\u003e90-100 /minute*\\) — in which case it becomes more difficult to measure the QT and determine its clinical significance.\n\n+ ***To Measure the QT*** — Select a lead where you can clearly see the *end* of the T wave. Select *that lead* in which the QT appears to be *longest*. \n+ **NOTE:** If there is no “q” wave in the QRS complex — Measure from the beginning of the R wave \\(Figure 06.1-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 06.1-1:** Provided that heart rate is *not* overly fast \\(ie, *90-100/minute*\\) — the **QT** is ***normal*** if it is *not more* than half the R-R interval. There are 3 possibilities: i\\) **Left Panel** — The **QT** is clearly **normal**; ii\\) **Middle** — The **QT** is ***“borderline”***, as it is approximately *half* the R-R interval \\(*or at most, slightly more than half the R-R interval*\\); or iii\\) **Right** — The **QT** is ***clearly* prolonged**.\n\n**06.2 – LIST \\#3: *Causes of QT Prolongation***\n\nClinically — We want to know IF the QT is normal or long. This is usually easy to tell by the ***“eyeball” *method **\\(ie, *Is the QT more than half the R-R interval?*\\) — provided that the heart rate is *not* excessively fast \\(*\u003e90-100/minute*\\).\n\n+ Practically speaking — one *only* cares IF the QT interval is normal, borderline, or long. Patients with a long QT interval are at *increased* risk of developing the potentially *life-threatening* arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes \\(*Section 06.6*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:*** Hypercalcemia** produces **QT shortening**. That said — Hypercalcemia is *difficult* to recognize on ECG, and is usually *only* seen with very high serum calcium values \\(*of \u003e12 mg/dL*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Causes of a *Long* QT:**\n\nThe common causes of a *long* QT interval can be divided into 3 categories: **i\\)** Drugs; **ii\\)** Electrolyte disorders; and **iii\\)** CNS catastrophes. We consolidate this information in our **LIST \\#3 **\\(Figure 06.2-1\\):\n\n+ ***KEY* Point:** The NOTE at the bottom of List \\#3 reminds us that *other* conditions \\(ie, *ischemia/infarction/BBB*\\) — may also prolong the QT. Clinically — We pay *less* attention to the QT interval when the ECG picture is dominated by *other* findings. But IF the *only* thing wrong \\(*beyond nonspecific changes*\\) is a *long *QT — *Think ****“Drugs/Lytes/CNS”**** as the cause\\!* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 06.2-1:** List \\#3 = Common Causes of a *Long* QT Interval.\n\n**06.3 – A Closer Look at LIST \\#3: *Drugs – Lytes – CNS ***\n\nWe expand on the causes of QT prolongation in LIST \\#3 \\(Figure 06.2-1\\) — by emphasizing the following points:\n\n+ **DRUGS** — An ever *increasing* number of drugs \\(*in addition to those in List \\#3*\\) may *either* affect the QT interval directly — *and/or *— produce p450 system drug interactions that increase Torsades risk if taken together with *other* QT-lengthening drugs. Clinically — it is usually *not* a problem in an otherwise healthy adult to take any single drug that may affect the QT. But — the amount of QT prolongation \\(*and the risk of Torsades*\\) may be *additive* IF *more* than one *QT-lengthening* drug is taken — especially if circumstances or *other* condition *predisposing* to Torsades is present \\(*Section 06.4*\\). \n+ **LYTES** — 3 electrolyte disorders should be kept in mind when assessing a patient with QT prolongation: **i\\) *Hypokalemia*** — is characterized by ST flattening/depression; development of **U waves**; and QT lengthening \\(*Section 11.7*\\); **ii\\) *Hypomagnesemia*** — produces *identical* ECG and clinical effects as hypokalemia \\(*Section 11.8*\\); and **iii\\) Hypocalcemia** — which if other electrolytes are normal, tends to produce a *normal* T wave after a *prolonged* QT interval \\(*Section 11.1*\\). \n+ NOTE: Rather than “QT” lengthening — it is really the **“QU” interval** that is prolonged with hypokalemia *and/or *hypomagnesemia \\(*as T and U waves tend to fuse as the U wave becomes bigger with more profound electrolyte depletion*\\). \n+ **CNS catastrophes** \\(ie, *coma, stroke, trauma, seizure, bleed*\\) — are known to produce some of the most ***bizarre* ST-T wave abnormalities** \\(*and some of the longest QT intervals*\\). Resultant ST segment elevation that may be seen with CNS catastrophes can at times *mimic* the changes of *acute *MI. The reason for ST-T wave abnormalities with CNS disorders is *uncertain* — but is thought to relate to disturbance of autonomic tone. \n\n \n\n**06.4 – Conditions* Predisposing* to a *Long* QT/Torsades**\n\nBe aware of circumstances that *increase* the **risk** of QT prolongation and therefore of developing ***Torsades de Pointes***. These include:\n\n+ ***Female* sex** \\(*women are more predisposed to Torsades\\!*\\). \n+ ***Electrolyte* disorders** \\(*low K\\+/low Mg\\+\\+*\\). \n+ ***Bradycardia*** \\(*usually 50/minute*\\) — since a long *preceding* R-R interval \\(*as seen with bradycardia*\\) sets up prolongation of the QT interval for the following beat. \n+ ***Structural* heart disease** \\(*heart failure; marked LVH; cardiomyopathy; ischemia; prior infarction*\\). \n+ Significant ***renal*** or ***hepatic* dysfunction**. \n+ ***Baseline* QT prolongation** — if the QTc is \u003e450 msec. \\(*especially if \u003e500 msec. *— *Section 06.5*\\). \n\n \n\n**06.5 – The QTc: *Corrected QT Interval***\n\nUp to now — We have focused on the ***“eyeball method”*** for determining IF the QT interval is normal or long:\n\n+ IF the **QT** is ***less*** than ***half*** the **R-R** — then the **QT** is ***normal***. \n+ But IF the **QT** is ***more*** than ***half*** the **R-R** — the **QT** is **long** \\(Figure 06.1-1\\). \n\n \n\nIn either case, more precise determination of the QT interval is usually *not* necessary — since for practical purposes, the main thing we are concerned with is whether the QT is normal or long. That said — at times it *will* be important to more precisely determine the QT. This is especially true when it is *not* readily apparent from inspection whether the QT interval is normal or long.\n\n+ Tables exist for precise determination of the **QT** based on the ***age***, ***sex*** and ***heart rate***. Accounting for difference in heart rate results in a **QTc** — where the *“little c”* indicates ***correction*** of the QT for heart rate. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The formula for determining **QTc** = the QT that you measure — divided by the *square root* of the R-R interval. The “good news” is that at a heart rate of 60/minute — the R-R interval = 5 large boxes \\(= *1.0 secon*d\\) — and *the square root of one is one\\!* This means that at a rate of 60/minute — the QTc is the QT interval that you measure. \n+ ***KEY* Point:** The *computerized* interpretation will accurately calculate the QTc for you\\! In general — the ***upper* normal** for the **QTc** is** ~450msec**. *More* than this suggests QT prolongation. *Definite* concern about QT prolongation increases once the QTc *exceeds* 480 msec \\(*especially ****if \u003e500 msec***\\)\\! \n\n \n\n**06.6 – Torsades: *WHY Care about QT Prolongation? ***\n\n*Why Care* about the QT interval? The answer is to hopefully *prevent* the rhythm seen in **Figure 06.6-1**. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was ongoing at the time this tracing was obtained.\n\n\n\n**Figure 06.6-1:** Irregular WCT rhythm obtained during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. What is the rhythm? What to do next? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.6-1:** After 2 sinus beats — the rhythm dramatically changes. This is ***polymorphic* VT** — as defined by constantly *varying* QRS morphology *throughout* the rest of the tracing.\n\n+ ***Torsades de Pointes*** — is defined as ***polymorphic* VT** that occurs in association **with** a ***prolonged* QT** interval on baseline ECG. The very rapid *irregular* WCT seen in Figure 06.6-1 manifests the shifting QRS polarity around the baseline \\(*“twisting” of the points*\\) that is characteristic of Torsades. \n+ **NOTE:** There appears to be a ***prolonged* QT interval** for the first 2 sinus beats in Figure 06.6-1 \\(ie, *the QT looks to be more than half the R-R interval*\\) — in which case the rhythm would be **Torsades**. That said — it is difficult to be certain where the T wave \\(*and therefore the “QT” interval*\\) ends in this tracing. Clinically — It will simply *not* always be possible to assess QT duration during *polymorphic* VT. \n+ ***Clinical* Reality** — When we *either* do not have access to a prior *baseline* 12-lead ECG on the patient or cannot accurately assess the QT interval from the rhythm strip — we will be *unable* to distinguish whether the rhythm is **PMVT** \\(*PolyMorphic Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) — or **“Torsades”** \\(*which is simply PMVT with baseline QT prolongation*\\). \n\n \n\n**Treatment of Figure 06.6-1:** *Regardless* of whether this *irregular* WCT rhythm is PMVT or Torsades — ***initial* treatment measures** are the same: **i\\)** Defibrillation if the rhythm persists; **ii\\)** Magnesium Sulfate \\(*1-2 gm IV — which often needs to be repeated up to 4-8 gm*\\); and **iii\\)** Try to find and fix the *underlying* cause of PMVT/Torsades. Potential additional measures for resistant cases \\(ie, *overdrive pacing, isoproterenol*\\) extend beyond the scope of this ePUb on ECG diagnosis.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* There are some differences in etiology and response to treatment between Torsades vs PMVT *without* QT prolongation that are worthy of mention. While IV Magnesium Sulfate is the drug of choice for *both* disorders — PMVT tends to respond less well to this treatment than when there is Torsades *with* QT prolongation. Rather than being drug or electrolyte induced — PMVT with a *normal* QT more often has an *ischemic* etiology \\(*occasionally due to Brugada Syndrome*\\). Efforts addressed at treating acute ischemia may therefore be helpful. IV Amiodarone *and/or* β-blockers may reduce recurrence and should be considered if IV Magnesium is ineffective. \n\n \n\n**06.7 – FIGURE 06.7-1: *Torsades vs PMVT vs Something Else? ***\n\nWould you treat *both* of the rhythms in Figure 06.7-1 with defibrillation and IV Magnesium?\n\n+ What *additional* information is essential for answering this question? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 06.7-1:** Torsades vs PMVT vs *something* else? \\(*See text*\\). HINT: Timelines for determining heart rate are shown by the *square* boxes in each tracing \\(*corresponding to a large box on ECG grid paper in each case*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.7-1:** At first glance, it appears that *both* of these rhythm strips represent PMVT/Torsades.  While superficially they do — the devil is in the details \\(*in this case the ****rate**** of the rhythm*\\). \n\n+ Note in **Rhythm A** of Fig. 06.7-1 —** **that there are at certain points in the tracing *two* vertical deflections for each large box. This corresponds to a rate of ~500-to-600/minute, or *too fast* for Torsades. This is **artifact**. We do *not* see any normal beats on this tracing — but instead just see very straight line, *excessively* fast deflections suggestive of artifact. \n+ The rate in **Rhythm B** is also fast — but much closer to ~300/minute \\(*~1 complex per each large box*\\) — which clearly falls within the appropriate rate range for **PMVT/Torsades**. The rhythm begins and ends by a few normal \\(*narrow*\\) sinus beats. Given the rapid rate — it is difficult to determine if the QT is or is not prolonged. Therefore, we can *not* be certain if **Rhythm B** is PMVT or technically qualifies as “Torsades”. As emphasized in Section 06.6 — initial treatment measures are the same *regardless* of whether or not there is baseline QT prolongation. \n\n \n\n***KEY *Point:** — Awareness of ***clinical* context** is an essential component of *clinical* ECG interpretation. The diagnostic dilemma of whether **Rhythm A** in Figure 06.7-1 is “real” might be *easily* resolved IF we *knew* that the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable \\(*which would confirm artifact*\\). Loose lead connections, tremor, scratching, shivering, and seizure activity are but a few of the possible causes of *artifact-related* deflections that might simulate a tachyarrhythmia.\n\n**06.8 – FIGURE 06.8-1: *Is the QT Long? ***\n\nComment on the QT interval for the 12-lead ECG shown in Figure 06.8-1. What *clinical* conditions are likely to account for findings on this ECG?\n\n\n\n**Figure 06.8-1:** Is the QT interval prolonged? If so — What is the likely cause\\(s\\)?\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.8-1:** The rhythm is sinus tachycardia at a rate just over 100/minute. The PR interval and QRS duration are both normal. However — the **QT interval** is **long**:\n\n+ As emphasized in Section 06.1 — the QT interval should be measured in a lead where you can clearly see the *end* of the T wave and in which the QT appears to be longest. As a result — a lead such as **aVL** should *not* be used, since the end of the T wave is *not* well defined in this lead \\(*red question mark in* Fig. 06.8-1\\). \n+ On the other hand — it is much easier to determine the limits of the T wave in *other* leads. This is especially true for** lead V2** — in which the QT interval is obviously *more* than half the R-R interval. **NOTE:** Although the “eyeball method” for assessing QT interval duration is admittedly *less* accurate when heart rate exceeds 90-100/minute \\(*Section 06.2*\\) — QT duration in Figure 06.8-1 is *so much more* than half the R-R interval, that the QT is undoubtedly prolonged *despite* the fact that the heart rate is relatively rapid. \n+ Regarding assessment of the *rest* of the ECG in Figure 06.8-1 — the most remarkable finding is **deep, *symmetric* T wave inversion** in most precordial leads. \n\n \n\n**IMPRESSION:** Sinus tachycardia — *marked* QT prolongation — and diffuse *symmetric* T wave inversion. In addition to ischemia \\(*which is suggested by this symmetric T wave inversion*\\) — *Think* **“Drugs/Lytes/CNS”** as the categories of entities to consider in your differential diagnosis for the ***markedly* prolonged QT interval** seen here \\(**LIST \\#3** *in* Figure 06.2-1\\). Clinical correlation is *needed* to comment further on the most likely causes.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The reason we say the QT interval is *markedly* prolonged — is that the QT literally makes up *more* than 2/3 of the R-R interval \\(*See insert of leads V2,V3 in* Figure 06.8-1\\). Thus *despite* the relatively rapid rate and the possibility of ischemia — strong consideration should be given to *drug-induced* QT prolongation — *severe* hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia — *and/or* CNS catastrophe as *contributing* causes \\(List \\#3\\). \n\n \n\n**06.9 – FIGURE 06.9-1: *Is the QT Long? ***\n\nWe conclude this segment on assessment of the QT interval with one more 12-lead tracing \\(Figure 06.9-1\\). The rhythm is sinus tachycardia at a rate of ~150/minute. There is diffuse ST segment depression. Comment on the QT interval.\n\n\n\n**Figure 06.9-1:** Sinus tachycardia at ~150/minute. There is diffuse ST depression. Comment on the QT interval \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.9-1:** As stated — there is sinus tachycardia and diffuse ST segment depression. Clearly — a heart rate of ~150/minute is *too fast* to accurately apply the “eyeball method” for QT assessment. That said — a look at *multiple* leads in Figure 06.9-1 — suggests that the QT interval makes up as much as ~80% \\(*if not more*\\) of the R-R interval.\n\n+ While *numerical* determination of a QTc is *not* realistic for the ECG in Figure 06.9-1 \\(*because the rate is too fast*\\) — we strongly suspect the QT is significantly prolonged. Clinically — We again consider *“Drugs/Lytes/CNS”* as possible contributing causes. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**06.10 – QTc Addendum: *Using/Calculating the QTc ***\n\n\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** As emphasized in Section 06.5 — the *computerized* interpretation will automatically generate a QTc value for you that takes into account the patient’s baseline heart rate. The ***computer-calculated* QTc** is usually quite accurate. As a result — a perfectly appropriate approach is to first *estimate* QT interval duration yourself by the “eyeball method” \\(*the QT should not be more than half the R-R interval*\\) — and, to *then* check this out with the QTc value provided by the computer:\n\n+ The **upper *normal* limit** for the **QTc** is** ~450msec**. QTc values greater than this suggest QT prolongation. \n+ Clinically — concern about QT prolongation increases once the QTc *exceeds* 480 msec \\(*especially ****if \u003e500 msec***\\)\\! \n\n \n\nAn advantage of incorporating the *computer-calculated* QTc value — is that doing so facilitates ***serial* comparison** of **QT duration** in a given patient. For example — *slight* prolongation of the QTc from a baseline of 430 msec to 445 msec in a patient started on Sotalol \\(*an antiarrhythmic agent known to significantly increase QT duration when used in higher doses*\\) would *not* necessarily mandate stopping the drug or even lowering the dose. However, continued *progressive* QT prolongation \\(*say, from 430 msec — to 445 msec — to 470 msec*\\) *— *would clearly require reassessment of the treatment regimen.\n\n**06.11 – BEYOND-the-Core: *Estimating the QTc Yourself***\n\nFor those providers with a desire to quickly estimate the QTc on their own *without* need to use the *computer-calculated* value — We propose the following:\n\n+ The formula for determining **QTc** = the QT that you measure — divided by the ***square* root** of the **R-R interval**. The “good news” is that at a heart rate of 60/minute — the R-R interval = 5 large boxes \\(= *1.0 secon*d\\) — and *the square root of one is one\\!* This means that at a rate of 60/minute — the QTc is the QT interval that you measure. \n+ At heart rates *faster* than 60/minute — the QTc will be *more* than the QT that you measure \\(*because QTc varies inversely with the square root of the R-R interval — and the R-R interval for rates faster than 60/minute is less than one*\\). \n+ Determining the *square* root for *any* R-R interval *other than* an R-R interval of exactly 1.0 second is complex. *This is why a computer is needed *for precise QTc calculation. That said — We have devised a **simple *correction* factor** that can be used to rapidly *approximate* QTc duration. \n\n \n\n**Use of Our Proposed *Correction* Factor for QTc Estimation:**\n\nDetermine the heart rate. Measure the QT interval in a lead where you can *clearly* see the end of the T wave and in which the QT interval appears to be *longest*. Then **multiply** the QT interval you measure **by** the ***correction* factor** corresponding to your estimation of heart rate:\n\n+ Multiply by **1.0** for a heart rate of **~60**/minute. \n+ Multiply by **1.1** for a heart rate of **~75**/minute. \n+ Multiply by **1.2** for a heart rate of **~85**/minute. \n+ Multiply by **1.3** for a heart rate of **~100**/minute. \n\n \n\n**Applying the QTc *Correction* Factor:**\n\nLet’s assume that the QT interval you ***measure*** is **0.40 second** \\(= *precisely 2 large boxes in duration*\\). IF the heart rate was ~60/minute — then the QTc = the QT you measure = 0.40 second.\n\n+ IF on the other hand, the heart rate was **75/minute** — then we can estimate the QTc by multiplying the QT we measure \\(= *0.40 second*\\) by the ***correction* factor** of **1.1** = **~0.44 second**. \n+ IF instead the heart rate was **~85/minute** — then the **QTc** would be 0.40 X **1.2** = **~0.48 second**. \n+ IF instead the heart rate was **~100/minute** — then the **QTc** would be 0.40 X **1.3** = **~0.52 second**. \n+ Accuracy for QTc estimation decreases with rates substantially faster than 100/minute — so we do not offer additional correction factors beyond this rate. \n+ Practically speaking — there is no need to correct the QT for rate when there is bradycardia \\(*since change in the QTc is relatively small at rates below 60/minute*\\). \n\n \n\n**06.12 – FIGURE 06.12-1: *Approximate the QTc ***\n\nThe 12-lead ECG in Figure 06.12-1 shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate just over 75/minute \\(*since the R-R interval is just under 4 large boxes in duration*\\).\n\n+ Assess the QT by the “eyeball method”. Is the QT interval likely to be normal or prolonged? \n+ Estimate the QTc by applying the appropriate *correction* factor from Section 06.11 that corresponds to a heart rate just over 75/minute. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 06.12-1:** Sinus rhythm at a rate just over 75/minute. Assess the QT interval. Approximate the QTc \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.12-1:** As stated — there is sinus rhythm at a rate just over 75/minute.\n\n+ We select **lead V2** to measure the QT — because we can clearly see the end of the T wave in this lead. Alternatively We could have measured the QT in a number of other leads \\(ie, *leads II, V3,V4,V5*\\). \n+ By the ***“eyeball method”*** — the **QT *appears*** to be **normal** \\(*since the QT is not more than half the R-R interval*\\). \n+ As shown in Figure 06.12-1 — We ***measure*** the **QT** to be **~0.38 second** \\(*just a bit less than 2 large boxes in duration*\\). \n+ Given the heart rate *close* to **75/minute** — We use a ***correction* factor** of **1.1**. Multiplying 0.38 X 1.1 is *approximately* **0.42 second** = the **QTc**. Since **420 msec** is clearly *less* than normal upper limit of 450 msec \\(*Section 06.10*\\) — we *know* that the **QTc** is **normal** even *without* referring to the *computer-calculated* value. \n\n \n\n**06.13 – FIGURE 06.13-1: *Approximate the QTc ***\n\nThe 12-lead ECG in Figure 06.13-1 shows sinus tachycardia at a rate of ~100/minute \\(*since the R-R interval is ~3 large boxes in duration*\\). The QRS complex is narrow.\n\n+ Assess the QT by the “eyeball method”. Is the QT interval likely to be normal or prolonged? \n+ Estimate the QTc by applying the appropriate *correction* factor from Section 06.11 that corresponds to a heart rate of ~100/minute. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 06.13-1:** Sinus tachycardia at ~100/minute. Assess the QT interval. Approximate the QTc \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 06.13-1:** As stated — there is sinus tachycardia at a rate of ~100/minute. The QRS complex is *narrow* — so any QT widening that may be seen is *not* the result of bundle branch block or other conduction defect.\n\n+ We again select **lead V2** to assess the QT. By the ***“eyeball method”*** — the **QT *appears*** to be ***markedly* prolonged**. Although heart rate is *faster* than is optimal for QT assessment — the QT takes up *more* than 2/3 of the R-R interval. There is therefore *no doubt* that the QT is prolonged. \n+ As shown in Figure 06.13-1 — We ***measure*** the **QT** to be **~0.48 second** \\(*easily more than 2 large boxes in duration*\\). \n+ Given the heart rate = **100/minute** — We use a ***correction* factor** of **1.3**. Multiplying 0.48 X 1.3 comes to a **QTc** of ***over* 600 msec**\\! Therefore — we *know* that the **QTc** is ***dangerously* prolonged** *without* having to refer to the *computer-calculated* value. \n\n \n\n**BOTTOM Line:** This QTc Addendum \\(*Sections 06.10-thru-06.13*\\) is written solely for those wanting additional insight into clinical use of more precise QTc determination, including a *user-friendly* method for rapid estimation of the QTc on your own *without* need to refer to the *computer-calculated* value. We emphasize that this is *advanced* material.\n\n+ Most of the time — it suffices to simply use the *“eyeball method”* covered in Sections 06.1 and 06.2 for QT assessment. \n+ Awareness that *computerized* interpretations *automatically* provided you with a fairly accurate QTc value corrected for heart rate helps take QT interval assessment one step further. The normal upper limit for QT duration is ~450 msec. QTc values greater than this amount indicate QT prolongation. Clinical concern about QT prolongation increases with QTc intervals that *exceed* 480-500 msec. *Serial* QTc assessment may provide additional insight when *progressive* increase in QT duration is subtle. \n+ For those who want more — *Try out* our proposed method for rapid QTc estimation in Section 06.11. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**07.0 – Determining Axis / Hemiblocks**\n\n\n\n**07.1 – Overview: *Limb Lead Location***\n\nThe mean **QRS Axis** may be defined as the average direction of the heart’s electrical activity. A standard ECG is recorded by viewing the heart's electrical activity from 12 leads. Each lead records the heart's electrical potential from its own particular vantage point \\(**Figure 07.1-1**\\).\n\n+ As discussed in detail in Sections 03.1-thru-03.5 — the three ***standard* limb leads** are I, II, and III. Because electrical derivation of these leads is based on the premise of Einthoven's *equilateral* triangle — *each* of these leads is separated from each other by 60°, starting with **lead I** \\(*at *0°\\) — followed by **lead II** \\(*at *\\+60°\\) and **lead III** \\(*60° further away at *\\+120°\\). \n+ The ***augmented* limb leads** are each separated from each other by 120° — and as such form a *\"Mercedes-Benz\"* triangle \\(*dotted lines in *Figure 07.1-1\\) — beginning with *vertical* **lead aVF** \\(*at *\\+90°\\) — *lateral* **lead aVL** \\(*at *-30°\\) — and *distant* **lead aVR** \\(*which we can usually ignore in axis determination — *and *need not recall its degree location*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.1-1:** Limb lead location for calculation of axis.\n\n***Clinical* Reality:** Although axis determination is essential for diagnosis of the hemiblocks \\(*Section 07.9*\\) and may *contribute* to diagnosing RVH; pulmonary embolus; dextrocardia; and lead misplacement — most of the time, calculation of axis provides only *limited *clinical information.\n\n**07.2 – AXIS: *The Quadrant Approach***\n\nMean QRS axis is calculated in the *frontal* plane. The **2 *KEY* leads** that are used for axis determination are lead I and lead aVF:\n\n+ Think of **Lead I** — as the *\"starting\" *point. As such, it is easy to remember that this *horizontal *lead is oriented toward **0°** \\(Figure 07.2-1\\). \n+ Lead aV**F** — is oriented *perpendicular* to lead I \\(ie, *looking straight up from the* **F**eet\\). **Lead aVF** is therefore 90° *away* from lead I \\(*or at ***\\+90°**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.2-1:** Axis quadrants. A ***normal *axis** is defined by the borders of leads I and aVF \\(ie, *a normal axis lies between *0-to-90**°**\\).\n\n***KEY* Point:** It is easiest to define axis by **Quadrants**:\n\n+ A ***normal* axis** \\(*See* Figure 07.2-1\\) — is defined as lying *within *the limits of lead I \\(*at *0°\\) and lead aVF \\(*at *\\+90°\\). \n+ **LAD** \\(***L****eft ****A****xis ****D****eviation*\\) — lies between -1° to -90°. \n+ **RAD** \\(***R****ight ****A****xis ****D****eviation*\\) — lies between \\+91° to \\+180°. \n+ An ***indeterminate* axis** lies between \\+180° and \\+270° \\(*or between *-90°* and *-180°\\). This quadrant is the *furthest* away from the heart — and is often referred to as the *“northwest quadrant”* – or – *“No-man’s land”*. \n\n \n\n****\n\n***Clinical* Note:** Although by the ***Quadrant *Approach** we describe an axis of \\+95° as “RAD” and an axis of -10° as “LAD” — we emphasize that this *minimal* amount of axis deviation is *not* of clinical consequence. It is *rarely* important to be more precise than within 20-to-30° of the actual axis.\n\n**07.3 – AXIS: *The Concept of Net QRS Deflection***\n\nDetermination of the mean axis ***quadrant*** can be made *at a glance — *by inspection \\(*and comparison*\\) of the ***net* QRS deflection** in **lead I** vs **lead aVF**. To determine the *“net”* QRS deflection in any given lead *— Mentally* subtract *negative* deflections from *positive* ones \\(**Figure 07.3-1**\\). It is “net area” that counts. For example:\n\n+ **Panel A** \\(*in* Figure 07.3-1\\) *— *is *all* positive. \n+ **Panel B** *— *is *predominantly* positive \\(*compared to the R wave, the s wave is small*\\). \n+ **Panel C** *— *is* predominantly* positive \\(*with a small q wave and a small s wave — but a tall R wave*\\). \n+ **Panel D** *— *is positive \\(*albeit with no more than a small R wave*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** The reason we use both ***small-case*** and ***large-case* letters** in describing Q, R and S wave deflections *— *is to convey ***relative* size**. While we are *not* aware of any official distinction between *small*- vs *large-case — *We favor use of **3 mm** \\(*3 little boxes*\\) as our defining characteristic:\n\n+ **Q**, **R**, and **S** waves all manifest an amplitude of ***at least* 3 mm**. \n+ The amplitude of **q**, **r** and **s waves** is 3 mm or less. We generally use a *small-case* designation for 3 mm deflections that are narrow vs *large-case* designation for a 3 mm deflection that is wider. Thus, we describe the complex in **Panel C** of Fig. 07.3-1 as a **qRs** deflection. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.3-1:** Illustration of how to assess ***“net”* QRS deflection**. Each of the examples shown here manifest a net *positive* deflection \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**07.4 – FIGURE 07.4-1: *How to Rapidly Determine Axis Quadrant***\n\nWe can determine the quadrant in which the axis lies *within seconds* by 2 simple steps: **Step \\#1:** Assess the *net* QRS deflection in leads I and aVF; and **Step \\#2:** Use the Table in **Figure 07.4-1**:\n\n\n\n**Figure 07.4-1:** Rapid determination of the axis quadrant based on the *net* QRS deflection in leads I and aVF. For example — IF *net* QRS deflection is positive in *both* leads I and aVF — then the axis is normal \\(*between* 0-to-90°\\).\n\n**07.5 – AXIS: *Refining the Quadrant Approach***\n\nUsing the Table in Figure 07.4-1 allows *near* instant determination of the axis quadrant. We can refine our estimate for axis by considering the following:\n\n+ IF the *net QRS deflection* in **lead I** \\(*at* 0°\\) is about the same as that for** lead aVF** \\(*at* \\+90°\\) — then the axis should lie *midway* between these leads \\(= *close to* \\+45° \\). \n+ Instead — IF the *net* QRS deflection in lead I is positive but clearly *exceeds* the net deflection in lead aVF — then the mean QRS axis lies *closer* to lead I \\(ie, *between* 0° *and* \\+40°\\). \n+ In contrast — the axis lies *closer* to lead aVF \\(*between* \\+50° *and* \\+90°\\) — IF the *net* QRS deflection in lead aVF is greater than it is in lead I. \n+ The axis is ***perpendicular*** to \\(ie, ***90° away**** from*\\) a lead where the QRS complex is **isoelectric** \\(*equal parts positive and negative to the QRS*\\). \n+ **All you are doing is *approximating*.** Axis calculation need *not* be exact — *as long as your estimate is within* 20-to-30° *of the actual axis*. As a result — we often provide an ***axis* range** for our answer \\(ie, *The axis lies between *\\+40°* to *\\+50°\\). \n+ Realize that you can ***further* refine** your estimate of axis by looking at net QRS deflection in *other* limb leads. That said — this is usually *not* clinically needed, as will soon be apparent in review of the axis examples that follow. \n+ Final Note: The ***computerized* interpretation** is usually quite accurate for determination of heart rate, intervals and axis. IF you prefer — you can almost always depend on the axis calculated by the computer. \n\n \n\n**07.6 – FIGURE 07.6-1: *What is the Axis?***\n\nBased on the *net* QRS deflection in leads I and aVF — Estimate the *mean* QRS axis in **Panels A** and **B** of Figure 07.6-1.\n\n+ In *which* of the 4 Quadrants does the axis lie? \\(*Feel free to refer back to Sections 07.4 and 07.5 in formulating your answer*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.6-1:** Estimate the axis for **Panels A** and **B**. In *which* of the 4 quadrants does the axis lie?\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.6-1:** We can tell *at a glance* that the axis is normal \\(*between *0-to-90°\\) in *both* **A** and **B** — because the *net* QRS deflection in *both* leads I and aVF is *positive* in *each* case. Use of a ***quadrant* diagram** allows us to refine our estimate for axis \\(**Figure 07.6-2**\\):\n\n+ **Panel A** \\(*in* Figure 07.6-1\\) — We ***estimate*** the axis at *between*** \\+30-40°**. The net deflection for *both* I and aVF is positive. The R wave in lead I is clearly *taller* than it is in lead aVF. As a result — the axis must lie *closer* to lead I \\(*or between *0-to-45**°**\\). We illustrate this in **Panel A** of Figure 07.6-2. \n+ **Panel B** \\(*in* Figure 07.6-1\\) — We ***estimate*** the axis at *between*** \\+60-75°**. The net QRS deflection is decidedly *more* positive in aVF \\(**Panel B** *in* Fig. 07.6-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.6-2: **Quadrant diagram illustrating axis location \\(*black arrows*\\) for Panels **A** and **B** from Fig. 07.6-1.\n\n**07.7 – FIGURE 07.7-1: *What is the Axis?***\n\nEstimate the *mean* QRS axis in **Panels C** and **D** of Figure 07.7-1:\n\n\n\n**Figure 07.7-1:** Estimate the axis for **Panels C** and **D**. In *which* of the 4 quadrants does the axis lie?\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.7-1:** We can tell *at a glance* that the axis is *normal* for **C** \\(*positive deflection in I *and* aVF*\\) — but *not* normal in **D** \\(*negative deflection in one of these leads*\\). Use of a ***quadrant* diagram** allows a closer look \\(**Figure 07.7-2**\\):\n\n+ **Panel C** \\(*in* Figure 07.7-1\\) — We ***estimate*** the axis at *between*** \\+10-20°**. *Relative* positivity of the *net* deflection in lead I compared to aVF is even *more* marked than it was for **Panel A** in Figure 07.6-1. The axis in **Panel C** must therefore lie *very close* to lead I \\(*as shown in* **Panel C** *of the quadrant diagram in* Figure 07.7-2\\). \n+ **Panel D** \\(*in* Figure 07.7-1\\) — There is at least ***slight* LAD** \\(*Left Axis Deviation*\\) — since *net* QRS deflection is *negative* in lead aVF. As we will see momentarily in discussion of hemiblocks \\(*Section 07.9*\\) — use of lead II will be needed to determine if the amount of LAD is more or less than -30**°**. We illustrate slight ***leftward* axis** for **Panel D** in the corresponding *quadrant* diagram shown in Figure 07.7-2. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.7-2: **Quadrant diagram illustrating axis location \\(*black arrows*\\) for Panels **C** and **D** from Fig. 07.7-1.\n\n**07.8 – FIGURE 07.8-1: *What is the Axis?***\n\nEstimate the *mean* QRS axis in **Panels E** and **F** of Figure 07.8-1:\n\n\n\n**Figure 07.8-1:** Estimate the axis for **Panels E** and **F**. In *which* of the 4 quadrants does the axis lie?\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.8-1:** We can tell *at a glance* that the axis is *not* normal for **E** or **F** — because *net* QRS deflection is *not* positive in *both* leads I and aVF. Use of a ***quadrant* diagram** allows a closer look \\(**Figure 07.8-2**\\):\n\n+ **Panel E** \\(*in* Figure 07.8-1\\) — There is **RAD** \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) — since* net* QRS amplitude in lead I is clearly negative \\(*the S in lead I is deeper than the R wave is tall*\\). We estimate mean QRS axis to be *between* \\+100-to-110**°**. We illustrate this in **Panel E** of the Figure 07.8-2 *quadrant* diagram. ***Clinical* NOTE:** It is sometimes difficult to accurately determine the specific number of degrees with right axis deviation. That said — it is *not* overly important whether the axis is \\+105°, or for that matter \\+120°. What counts clinically — is that there is *definite* RAD. \n+ **Panel F** \\(*in* Figure 07.8-1\\) — The **axis** is ***indeterminate*** — since the *net* QRS deflection is *negative* in *both* leads I and aVF. Clinically — *it no longer matters* how many degrees the axis is. All that counts is that axis location is in the upper right \\(*indeterminate*\\) quadrant \\(**Panel F** *in the* Figure 07.8-2 *quadrant diagram*\\). **PEARL:** — The most common clinical conditions associated with an *indeterminate* axis are: **i\\)** RVH; **ii\\)** COPD; and **iii\\)** Large body habitus. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.8-2: **Quadrant diagram illustrating axis location \\(*black arrows*\\) for Panels **E** and **F** from Fig. 07.8-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**07.9 – Hemiblocks: *LAHB and LPHB***\n\n\n\n**07.10 – Hemiblocks: *Anatomic Considerations***\n\nAs seen below in **Figure 07.10-1** — after the electrical impulse arrives at the **AV Node** — it travels down the **Bundle of HIS**. From there, the ventricular conduction system divides into the slender ***Right* Bundle Branch** — and — the much thicker ***Common *Left Bundle Branch.**\n\n+ The *Common *Left Bundle Branch divides into 2 parts: the ***Anterior ***and ***Posterior *Hemifascicles**. Development of a ***“hemiblock”*** — simply entails a defect in conduction over one of these hemifascicles. \n+ Note in Figure 07.10-1 — that the ***posterior *hemifascicle** is anatomically much *thicker* than the ***anterior* hemifascicle**. This is one reason why LPHB is uncommon. The other reason is a richer \\(*dual*\\) blood supply compared to the anterior hemifascicle. As a result — it is ***rare*** to see **LPHB** as an ***isolated* defect** in a patient *without* significant heart disease. Most patients with LPHB have *bifascicular* block \\(*RBBB/LPHB* — *See Sections 07.20, 07.21*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.10-1:** The ventricular conduction system. Note how much *thicker* the left *posterior* hemifascicle is compared to the anterior hemifascicle and the right bundle branch.\n\n***KEY* Clinical Point:** The *anatomic* diagram in **Figure 07.10-1** is simplified. In reality — there are *millions* of fibers in the ventricular conduction system with many potential anatomic variants on the arrangement shown. That said, *most* of the time — conduction fibers to the left ventricle are arranged in two large groups \\(*hemifascicles*\\) — one of which is situated slightly in front \\(*anterior*\\) of the other.\n\n+ The benefit of accepting the arrangement in Figure 07.10-1 as the general anatomic model, is that it greatly ***simplifies* diagnosis** of the **hemiblocks**\\! \n\n \n\n**07.11 – *Advanced *Concept: LSFB \\(*a 3rd type of Fascicular Block*\\)**\n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* In a significant percentage of patients — a **3rd** \\(*septal*\\) **hemifascicle** appears to exist \\(*not shown in* Fig. 07.10-1\\). The collection of fibers that make up this ***septal* hemifascicle** is thinner, more variable in distribution than are fibers in the anterior and posterior hemifascicles, and generally manifests a shorter refractory period. As its name implies — fibers from the *septal* hemifascicle contribute to early activation of a portion of the ventricular septum in certain patients.\n\n+ As a result — a 3rd type of *partial* LBBB conduction block \\(*in addition to LAHB and LPHB*\\) may occur = **LSFB** \\(*Left Septal Fascicular Block*\\). \n+ **LSFB** is ***not* commonly recognized on ECG**. This is because of several reasons: **i\\)** the existence of this 3rd hemifascicle is *not* well appreciated; **ii\\)** LSFB is uncommon; and **iii\\)** ECG manifestations of LSFB when it *does* occur are often masked by *simultaneous* occurrence of *other* conduction defects. Practically speaking — *Do NOT* be concerned about recognizing LSFB *unless* you are a student of *advanced* arrhythmia interpretation. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** Our reason for mentioning the existence in some patients of a *septal* hemifascicle and therefore a potential *3rd type* of fascicular block is twofold: **i\\)** to shed light on the otherwise unexplained *coming-and-going* of septal q waves \\(*or of the initial small r wave in V1,V2*\\) that is sometimes seen in some challenging arrhythmias \\(*may be due to intermittent LSFB aberrant conduction*\\); and **ii\\)** to emphasize that the ***anatomic* arrangement** presented in **Figure 07.10-1** is a **simplification**. This simplification works well for understanding the general anatomic pattern of the ventricular conduction system — and it allows *rapid* diagnosis of the hemiblocks \\(*Section 07.12*\\). \n\n \n\n**07.12 – Hemiblocks: *An Approach to Rapid ECG Diagnosis***\n\nAgreement among experts is *lacking* regarding diagnostic criteria for hemiblock. Some experts specify a certain number of degrees in axis deviation — whereas others favor QRS morphology change rather than axis criteria. Fortunately — ECG diagnosis of hemiblocks can be simplified into an *equally* accurate yet ***user-friendly* approach** that allows classification in *less* than 5 seconds. This approach is based on the following concepts:\n\n+ There are **2 hemiblocks** that we need to concern ourselves with: ***anterior*** and ***posterior****. *Life is simpler \\(*and no less accurate in the overwhelming majority of cases*\\) if we do *not* initially concern ourself about the infrequent, *difficult-to-diagnose* 3rd type of conduction deflect = LSFB \\(*Section 07.11*\\). \n+ Of the 2 types of hemiblock that we *do* need to concern ourselves with *—* ***L****eft ****P****osterior ****H****emi****B****lock *\\(**LPHB**\\) — is **rare**\\! As already emphasized \\(*Section 07.10*\\) *—* the reason LPHB is so uncommon is that the *posterior* hemifascicle is much *thicker* anatomically and it has a *dual* blood supply \\(*from the left and right coronary arteries*\\); the anterior hemifascicle does not. \n+ *Even* **experts** often **do *not* agree** on the ECG diagnosis of **LPHB.** As a result — You are probably *none the worse* if you *never* diagnose LPHB. On those uncommon occasions when LPHB *does* occur — it will almost always be seen in association with RBBB \\(*See Section 07.21 and 07.25*\\). \n+ In contrast — diagnosis of **LAHB \\(*L****eft ****A****nterior ****H****emi-****B****lock*\\) — is far more common \\(\u003e*98% of hemiblocks in our experience*\\). ECG ***diagnosis*** of **LAHB** *becomes* easy — IF you accept as your criterion for diagnosis recognition of a ***pathologic* left axis** \\(*Section 07.13*\\). \n\n \n\n**07.13 – LAHB: *ECG Diagnosis = “pathologic” *LAD**\n\nExpert electrocardiographers do *not* agree on how to define LAHB. Some define it by the number of degrees \\(*be this requiring a leftward axis more negative than *-30°, -45°,* or *-60°\\). Others maintain that *rather than* axis — it is QRS morphology in the limb leads that defines LAHB. **Life is “simpler”** \\(*and equally accurate*\\) — IF you **equate *pathologic *LAD = LAHB**. Consider the following:\n\n+ *Some* LAD \\(ie, -10° *to* -20°\\) — is common and *not* necessarily abnormal. \n+ We define a ***pathologic* LAD** — as a left axis *more negative* than -30°. It is *easy* to tell IF *pathologic* LAD is present. ***You only need to look at lead II ***\\(Figure 07.13-1\\): \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.13-1:** Diagnosis is simplified by ***defining* LAHB** as a *“pathologic”* left axis \\(= *a net deflection in lead II that is more negative than positive*\\).\n\n***KEY Summarizing* Point:** For practical purposes — We equate the ECG diagnosis of **LAHB** with the finding of ***pathologic* LAD** \\(*which we define as a mean QRS axis more negative than *-30°\\).\n\n+ Assuming lead I is positive \\(*as it almost always is*\\) — then the *amount* of LAD is ***“pathologic”*** — IF the ***net *deflection** in **Lead II** is ***negative*** \\(*See Lead II Appearance in the lower right portion of *Figure 07.13-1\\). \n\n \n\n**07.14 – FIGURE 07.14-1: *Is there LAD? *IF so — *Is there LAHB?***\n\nApply the quadrant approach to determine the axis for the 12-lead ECG shown in Figure 07.14-1:\n\n+ Is there LAD? If so — Is there also LAHB? \n+ *Which lead* should be used to determine if LAHB is or is not present in Figure 07.14-1? \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure 07.14-1:** Estimate the axis. Is there LAD? If so — Is there also LAHB? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.14-1:** It is easy to determine the axis for the 12-lead ECG shown in Fig. 07.14-1 by use of the *quadrant* approach:\n\n+ The *net* QRS deflection in lead aVF is negative. It is positive in lead I. \n+ By the Table in Figure 07.4-1 — **LAD** is therefore present. The situation is similar to the example illustrated by **Panel D** in Section 07.7, which we reproduce below in **Figure 07.14-2**. \n+ Once established that there is LAD — We determine IF the amount of LAD is ***“pathologic”*** by looking at **lead II**. \n+ *Pathologic* LAD is clearly present in Figure 07.14-1 — since the *net* QRS deflection in lead II is decidedly more negative than positive. Therefore — there is **LAHB** in Figure 07.14-1. We estimate the mean QRS axis in this tracing to be *at least* -40°. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.14-2:** We reproduce Panel D from Section 07.7. The situation is similar to that shown in Figure 07.14-1. There is **LAD** — because the *net* QRS deflection is positive in lead I and negative in lead aVF. We would need to see **lead II** in order to determine IF the amount of LAD was “pathologic” \\(ie, *more negative than* -40°\\).\n\n**07.15 – SUMMARY: *ECG Diagnosis of LAHB in 3 Seconds***\n\nPanels **G** and **H** in Figure 07.15-1 summarize how to tell *within* seconds IF there is LAHB:\n\n+ **Panel G** — By the quadrant approach, the *more-negative-than-positive* deflection in lead aVF defines there to be LAD. However the lead II deflection is *not* more negative than positive. Therefore the axis is *not* more negative than -30° in Panel G, which means there is **LAD *but not* LAHB**. In fact — the *isoelectric* appearance in lead II means that the axis is virtually perpendicular to \\(*90° away from*\\) lead II — or *precisely* at -30°. \n+ **Panel H** — The once again *more-negative-than-positive* deflection in lead aVF defines there to be **LAD**. This time the lead II deflection is *more* negative than positive. Therefore the LAD is ***sufficiently* leftward** to qualify as **LAHB**. We estimate the mean QRS axis to be *at least* -40°. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.15-1:** Panels G *and* H *both* show **LAD**. There is **LAHB** in **H** but *not* in G \\(*because ****net QRS deflection**** is ****negative**** in ****lead II**** for ****H****, but not in G*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**07.16 – *Bifascicular* Block**\n\n\n\n**07.17 – Definition/Types of *Bifascicular* Block**\n\nThe term ***“bifascicular”* block** — implies that *more* than a single major branch of the ventricular conduction system is *not* functioning. The defect in conduction may be transient or permanent. Practically speaking — there are **2 Types** of ***Bifascicular *Block:**\n\n+ **RBBB/LAHB =** RBBB *plus *LAHB. \n+ **RBBB/LPHB =** RBBB *plus *LPHB. \n\n \n\n***Clinical *Note****:** Semantically — ***complete *LBBB** is also a type of *“bifascicular”* block — since there is implication of failed conduction \\(*by definition*\\) in *both* anterior and posterior hemifascicles when there is LBBB. That said — We generally do *not* think of LBBB as *“bifascicular”* block. This leaves us with the 2 types of hemiblock cited above \\(*RBBB \\+ either LAHB or LPHB*\\).\n\n**07.18 – RBBB/LAHB: *ECG Recognition***\n\nBy far — the most common form of ***bifascicular* block** is the *combination* of **RBBB/LAHB**. The *schematic* tracing in Figure 07.18-1 shows the typical ECG appearance of this conduction defect. Note the *underlying* rhythm is sinus \\(*upright P wave in lead II*\\) and the QRS looks to be wide. We focus attention on the 3 *key* leads for diagnosing BBB \\(*leads I,V1,V6* — *Section 05.2*\\) — *plus* on lead II.\n\n+ **RBBB** — is recognized by its characteristic appearance in the 3 *key* leads \\(*rSR’ with taller right rabbit ear in V1; wide terminal S wave in leads I,V6*\\). \n+ That there *also* is **LAHB** — is seen from the ***negative* net deflection** in **lead II** \\(*Section 07.13*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.18-1**: RBBB/LAHB.** RBBB** — is diagnosed by the rSR’ in lead V1 *with* wide, terminal S waves in I,V6. **LAHB** — is diagnosed by the decidedly *more-negative-than-positive *deflection in lead II \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**07.19 – *The Meaning of “Axis” when there is RBBB***\n\nThe concept of **“axis”** in the setting of RBBB is problematic. Calculation of axis is based on the ***average* direction** of the heart’s ***electrical* activity** in the frontal plane. In the presence of **RBBB** — electrical activity first goes **left-to-right** \\(*as the septum is depolarized*\\) — then **right-to-left** \\(*as the left ventricle is depolarized*\\) — and then ***left-to-right**** again* as the *blocked* right ventricle is finally activated via slow myocardial conduction through *nonspecialized* fibers. So in the setting of RBBB — the *“average direction”* of the heart’s electrical activity does *not* reflect the actual *zig-zag* path of the depolarization impulse.\n\n+ **Bottom Line:** — *Don’t worry about “axis”* when RBBB is present\\! \n+ All we care about when there is **RBBB** — is *which* of these **3 *possible* settings** is operative: **i\\) RBBB** and *nothing* else; **ii\\)** RBBB *plus*** LAHB**; or **iii\\)** RBBB *plus*** LPHB**. \n+ The ECG picture of **RBBB/LAHB** is *easy* to recognize. In addition to RBBB — We can tell at a glance IF **LAHB** is *also* present by a ***look*** at **lead II** to see IF the *net* QRS deflection is *predominantly* negative \\(Figure 07.18-1\\). \n\n \n\n**07.20 – *Clinical Implications of Bifascicular Block***\n\nThe clinical significance of virtually *any* conduction system defect depends on the setting in which it occurs. ***Isolated *RBBB** may sometimes occur in otherwise healthy individuals *without* underlying heart disease — in which case RBBB is *unlikely* to have any adverse prognostic implications \\(*Section 05.5*\\). In contrast — a ***new *finding** of **RBBB** in the setting of acute evolving MI implies *ongoing* conduction system damage \\(*suggesting a larger infarct size and possible need for a pacemaker*\\).\n\n+ ***Bifascicular *block** — clearly implies a more important conduction defect than *isolated *RBBB. That said — IF the patient is otherwise *asymptomatic, *then *bifascicular* block from **RBBB/LAHB** may *not *necessarily convey any adverse prognostic implications. *Combined* RBBB/LAHB is seen surprisingly often as an *incidental* finding in an otherwise asymptomatic older individual. \n+ On the other hand — IF *new *RBBB/LAHB develops in the setting of acute coronary syndrome — the extent of damage is probably large \\(*and the patient may soon need a pacemaker*\\). *Clinical* context is everything\\! \n+ The *other* form of *bifascicular* block =** RBBB/LPHB** — is **much *less* common**. As previously stated \\(*Section 07.10*\\) — the reason LPHB is so uncommon relates to its anatomy \\(*much thicker fascicle*\\) and *dual* blood supply. As a result, IF **RBBB/LPHB** *does* occur — it implies a more extensive conduction system defect \\(*with potentially more severe prognostic implications*\\). \n\n \n\n**07.21 – RBBB/LPHB: *ECG Recognition***\n\nThe *uncommon* form of ***bifascicular* block** — is the *combination* of **RBBB/LPHB**. The *schematic* tracing in Figure 07.21-1 shows the typical ECG appearance of this conduction defect. Note the *underlying* rhythm is sinus \\(*upright P wave in lead II*\\) and the QRS looks to be wide. We focus attention on the 3 *key* leads for diagnosing BBB \\(*leads I,V1,V6* — *Section 05.2*\\) — *plus* on lead II.\n\n+ **RBBB** — is recognized by its characteristic appearance in the 3 *key* leads \\(*rSR’ with taller right rabbit ear in V1; wide terminal S wave in leads I,V6*\\). \n+ That there *also* is **LPHB** — is seen from the presence in **lead I** of a **deep *straight* initial descent** of the **S wave** in this lead. In support of the diagnosis of RBBB/LPHB — is the presence of a qR pattern in lead II with a relatively tall R wave in this lead. \n+ **NOTE:** Leads II, III and aVF all typically manifest a *similar* ECG appearance when there is RBBB *plus* LPHB \\(ie,* a qR pattern with relatively tall R wave*\\). That said — We can *simplify* the process of recognizing RBBB/LPHB by focusing attention on QRS appearance in the 3 *key* leads \\(*I,V1,V6*\\) — *plus* on lead II — as is done in **Figure 07.21-1**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.21-1**: RBBB/LPHB.** RBBB** — is diagnosed by the rSR’ in lead V1 *with* wide, terminal S waves in I,V6. **LPHB** — is diagnosed by the very *steep* initial descent of the S wave in lead I. In addition — Note the qR pattern in lead II with relatively tall R wave \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**07.22 – RBBB/LPHB: *Finer Points on ECG Recognition***\n\nThe experts often do *not* agree on the diagnosis of *bifascicular* block from **RBBB/LPHB**. The *KEY* to recognizing this form of bifascicular block is that once *complete* RBBB is identified — *Focus* attention on **S wave *descent*** in **lead I.**\n\n+ As emphasized in Section 05.4 — a wide *terminal* S wave in *lateral* leads I,V6 is part of the *expected* QRS morphology seen with *complete* RBBB \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 07.22-1\\). That said — the initial \\(*straight portion*\\) of the S wave in lead I is *not* nearly as steep with *isolated* RBBB — as it is when LPHB is also present \\(*red arrow in* **Panel B** *of* Fig. 07.22-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.22-1**: RBBB by itself \\(**Panel A**\\) — compared to *bifascicular* block when there is RBBB *plus* LPHB \\(**Panel B**\\). Note the very *steep* initial descent of the S wave \\(*red arrow*\\) in lead I when LPHB is also present \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** Because the ***posterior* hemifascicle** lies not only posterior, but *also* inferior and rightward \\(*in 3 dimensions*\\) with respect to the anterior hemifascicle — the *blocked *portion of the QRS deflection in lead I is directed inferior and to the right. This is the reason for the *steep* negative S wave descent in lead I and the predominant *positive* R wave in leads II, III, and aVF \\(**Panel B** *in* Fig. 07.22-1\\).\n\n+ Typically — there will also be a slender initial r wave in lead I and a small narrow q wave in the *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) when there is **RBBB/LPHB**. This is because the *initial* direction of left ventricular depolarization with RBBB/LPHB is toward that part of the LV supplied by the *intact* left anterior hemifascicle. Given the *relative* leftward and superior orientation of the **left *anterior* hemifascicle** \\(*compared to the relative rightward and inferior orientation of the posterior hemifascicle*\\) — initial electrical activity with RBBB/LPHB tends to produce a small r in lead I and a small q in inferior leads \\(**Panel B** *in* Figure 07.22-1\\). That said — these subtle ECG features might be altered if in addition to RBBB/LPHB there has been prior scarring or infarction. \n+ **Bottom Line:** — Remember that *bifascicular* block from **RBBB/LPHB** is uncommon in clinical practice. ECG diagnosis is often challenging and encompasses an *advanced* subject area about which cardiologists do *not* always agree. You are probably *none the worse* if you *never* diagnose this entity. Our goal is merely to highlight the ECG features we find helpful for recognizing RBBB/LPHB when it is present. Realize that once you do identify this form of *bifascicular* block — it is almost certain that your patient has *extensive* underlying heart disease. \n\n \n\n**07.23 – FIGURE 07.23-1: *Is there Bifascicular Block?***\n\nAssess the ECG in Figure 07.23-1 for the presence of conduction defects.\n\n+ Is there *bifascicular* block? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.23-1:** Sinus rhythm *with* **RBBB/LPHB** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.23-1:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS complex is wide.\n\n+ **RBBB** — is recognized by its characteristic appearance in the 3 *key* leads \\(*rSR’ with taller right rabbit ear in V1; wide terminal S wave in leads I,V6*\\). \n+ In addition, there is **LPHB** — as diagnosed by the presence in **lead I** of a **deep *straight* initial descent** of the **S wave** in this lead. In support of the diagnosis of RBBB/LPHB — is the presence of a qR pattern in leads II,III,aVF with a relatively tall R wave in these leads \\(*especially in lead III*\\). Thus, there is ***bifascicular* block** \\(*RBBB/LPHB*\\). \n\n \n\n**07.24 – FIGURE 07.24-1: *Is there Bi- or Tri-Fascicular Block?***\n\nAssess the ECG in Figure 07.24-1 for the presence of conduction defects.\n\n+ Is there *bifascicular* block? \n+ What is *“trifascicular”* block? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.24-1:** Sinus rhythm *with* **RBBB/LAHB**. Is there *trifascicular* block? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.24-1:** The rhythm is sinus \\(*upright P wave in lead II, as shown by the red arrow*\\). The PR interval is prolonged \\(*clearly more than a large box in duration*\\) — so there is **1st degree AV block** \\(*Section 02.70*\\).\n\n+ The QRS complex is wide. Blowup inserts from the 3 *key* leads \\(*I,V1,V6*\\) — confirm **RBBB** \\(*rSR’ in V1; wide terminal S waves in leads I and V6*\\). NOTE: Even though the S wave in lead I is *not* deep — it *is* relatively wide, and this satisfies criteria for RBBB \\(*Section 05.4*\\). \n+ LPHB is clearly *not* present in Figure 07.24-1 — because the S in lead I is small *without* a steep descent. \n+ On the other hand — **LAHB** *is* present, because the QRS deflection in lead II is *predominantly* negative \\(*Section 07.18*\\). Therefore — there is ***bifascicular* block** \\(*RBBB/LAHB*\\). \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* The term, ***“trifascicular”* block** implies impaired conduction in *all* 3 of the major conduction fascicles: **i\\)** the right bundle branch; **ii\\)** the left *anterior* hemifascicle; and **iii**\\) the left *posterior* hemifascicle.\n\n+ Clinically — Diagnosis of *trifascicular *block is usually *not* possible from the surface ECG. We simply *cannot tell* IF PR interval prolongation in a patient with *bifascicular* block \\(*as in* Figure 07.24-1\\) is due to AV nodal disease or disease in the remaining conducting fascicle. Therefore — We would interpret this ECG as showing *bifascicular* block \\(*RBBB/LAHB*\\) plus 1st degree AV block. \n\n \n\n**07.25 – FIGURE 07.25-1: *Isolated LPHB vs Right Axis Deviation?***\n\nWe conclude our discussion on hemiblocks and *bifascicular* block with the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 07.25-1** — obtained from an otherwise healthy young adult male seen in the office for an insurance physical. The rhythm is sinus \\(*probable sinus arrhythmia*\\) — and the QRS complex does *not* appear to be prolonged.\n\n+ **RAD** \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) is clearly present — as determined by a predominantly *negative* QRS in lead I with an *upright* QRS in lead aVF. \n+ Does this patient have LPHB? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 07.25-1:** 12-lead ECG obtained from an otherwise healthy 30-year-old man. There is RAD. Does the patient have LPHB? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 07.25-1:** Although there is *marked* RAD — We would *not* interpret this tracing as showing LPHB because: **i\\)** LPHB is rarely seen as an isolated conduction defect; and** ii\\)** The patient is an otherwise *healthy* 30-year-old man — which is a distinctly *unusual* setting for LPHB to occur.\n\n+ We would interpret this ECG as showing sinus arrhythmia; RAD; and peaked T waves with some J-point ST elevation that is most suggestive of an early repolarization pattern. \n+ Given the *considerable* amount of RAD seen here — the possibility of RVH \\(*Right Ventricular Hypertrophy*\\) should be contemplated. Assuming no murmur was heard on auscultation — the decision of whether or not to obtain an Echo could be made clinically. \n+ Perhaps if *new* RAD to this degree was seen in a patient with ongoing *acute* infarction — the cause might be LPHB \\(*as occurs in* Figure 10.43-1\\). However, given the setting described here — this is highly unlikely. \n+ On occasion — otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults may present with RAD *not* due to RVH or other underlying structural heart disease. We suspect this is the situation here. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**08.0 – LVH: *Chamber Enlargement***\n\n\n\nThe unfortunate clinical reality is that the ECG is just *not* very accurate as a diagnostic tool for determining chamber enlargement. Even in the best of hands — the ***sensitivity*** of ECG for detecting ***LVH ***does *not* exceed 60% \\(*although specificity may approach 90 to 95% when certain criteria are met*\\). Diagnostic accuracy for determining ***RVH*** \\(***R****ight ****V****entricular ****H****ypertrophy*\\) and atrial enlargement is even less … \\(*See Sections 08.14-through-08.22; and 08.23-through-08.33*\\).\n\n+ Echocardiography is far superior to the ECG for diagnosing enlargement of *any* cardiac chamber. \n+ Therefore — IF you truly *need* to know — *Get an Echo\\!* \n\n \n\n**08.1 – ECG Diagnosis of LVH: *Simplified Criteria***\n\nThere are *more than *50 sets of criteria in the literature for ECG diagnosis of LVH. *None are optimal*. The ***simplified* criteria** for **LVH** we favor as providing what we feel is the *best* balance between sensitivity and specificity are shown in **Figure 08.1-1**.\n\n\n\n**Figure 08.1-1:** *Simplified* ECG criteria for LVH \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***KEY* Points:** The “beauty” of Figure 08.1-1 is that these *simplified* criteria *only* require recall of **2 numbers** = **“35”** and **“12”**. In our experience — these 2 criteria *almost* always allow diagnosis whenever it is possible by ECG to determine that there is LVH.\n\n+ Only one ***voltage* criterion** \\(ie, *35* or *12*\\) — needs to be satisfied for ECG diagnosis of LVH. \n+ Note that voltage criteria for LVH may ***not*** be **valid** for ***younger* patients**. This is because *younger* adults \\(*in their 20’s*\\) often manifest increased QRS amplitude *without* true chamber enlargement. We suggest ***not*** using the voltage criteria in Figure 08.1-1 for patients ***less*** than **35 years old**. \n+ The **accuracy** \\(*specificity*\\) for the ECG diagnosis of LVH can be ***greatly* increased** — IF *in addition* to satisfying one or more voltage criteria, ST-T wave changes of ***\"LV strain\"*** are *also* present \\(*Section 08.9*\\). \n+ The ***Clinical* History** helps in ***assessing*** for **LVH**. For example, it is important to appreciate even *before* looking at the ECG itself — that the chance of *true* chamber enlargement is *greatly* increased IF the tracing is obtained from a middle-aged, African-American man with ***longterm* hypertension**. KEY POINT: A history of ***underlying *heart disease** \\(*heart failure, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, coronary artery disease*\\) — clearly ***increases*** the **likelihood** of **LVH** in *any* given patient. \n\n \n\n**08.2 – LVH: *Physiologic Rationale for Voltage Criteria***\n\nThe *physiologic* rationale for derivation of virtually *all* voltage criteria for LVH is simple. We illustrate this concept in **Figure 08.2-1**:\n\n+ Normal **LV** \\(*Left Ventricle*\\) activation is directed *away* from ***right-sided* leads** \\(ie, *V1,V2*\\) — and toward ***left-sided* leads** \\(*aVL; V5,V6*\\). As a result — leads V1,V2 *normally* manifest a predominant S wave. \n+ Since the LV is situated to the left and posteriorly in the thorax — normal LV activation generally results in a *predominant* R wave in *left-sided* leads aVL,V5,V6 \\(**Panel A** in Fig. 08.2-1\\). With **LVH** — there is *more* LV mass \\(*large red arrow in* **Panel B**\\). As a result — the S wave in V1,V2 becomes deeper; and the R wave in aVL *and/or* V5,V6 becomes taller. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.2-1:** Rationale for derivation of LVH voltage criteria. There is *deepening* of the S wave in *right-sided* leads = V1,V2; and/or an *increase* in R wave amplitude in *left-sided* leads \\(ie, *V5,V6, aVL*\\).\n\n**08.3 – LVH: *ECG Diagnosis using Lead aVL***\n\nIn Section 03 — We discussed localization of **lead aVL** in the hexaxial lead system \\(*looking down at the heart from the left shoulder at an angle of approximately -30 degrees*\\). We then specified anatomic landmarks used for ***precordial* lead placement** when recording an ECG \\(*Section 03.6*\\). Awareness of this *relative* position of *unipolar* **lead aVL** \\(*looking down at the heart from the left shoulder*\\) — allows us to envision how lead aVL views the heart’s electrical activity from a ***higher* perspective** than ***precordial* leads** \\(ie, *V1,V2; V5,V6*\\) that are placed on the chest.\n\n+ As a result — Use of the criterion for **R wave amplitude** in **lead aVL ≥12mm** is likely to be *most* helpful when there is a ***leftward* axis** \\(*this aVL criterion may satisfy voltage for LVH despite sometimes minimal QRS size in V1,V2 and V5,V6*\\). \n+ Remember — Only 1 voltage criterion \\(*35* or *12*\\) is needed to satisfy “voltage for LVH”. \n\n \n\n**Figure 08.3-1: *LVH using Lead aVL***\n\nWe illustrate use of lead aVL for making the diagnosis of LVH by voltage in Figure 08.3-1. This ECG was obtained from an older adult with hypertension. R wave amplitude in lead aVL is clearly increased \\(*more than 3 large boxes — or greater than 15 mm*\\). However — there is no indication at all of voltage for LVH from assessment of QRS amplitude in the *precordial* leads \\(*deepest S in V1,V2 \\+ tallest R in V5,V6 is very much less than 35 mm*\\).\n\n+ Since only 1 voltage criterion is needed — the presence of a *tall* R wave in lead aVL \\(≥*12 mm*\\) in Figure 08.3-1 satisfies voltage criteria for LVH. \n+ Note there is LAD — as is evident from the predominantly *negative* QRS in lead aVF with *positive* QRS in lead I. This supports the premise that lead aVL tends to be most helpful as a voltage criterion for LVH in the presence of a *leftward* axis. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.3-1:** ECG obtained from an older adult with hypertension. Voltage criteria for LVH *are* satisfied by the *tall* R wave in lead aVL \\(≥*12 mm*\\) — despite relatively low voltage in the precordial leads \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**08.4 – FIGURE 08.4-1: *Is there Voltage for LVH?***\n\nThe ECG in **Figure 08.4-1** was obtained from an otherwise healthy 29-year old man who was seen in the office for an “insurance physical”.\n\n+ *Is there LVH?* \n+ HINT: Feel free to review the *simplified* criteria for LVH in Figure 08.1-1 before answering. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.4-1:** ECG from a 29-year old man. *Is there LVH?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.4-1:** The ECG shows sinus arrhythmia and is essentially normal. *There is no LVH* — because this patient is *less* than 35 years old. Note that ST-T waves are unremarkable. There is *no* indication of LV “strain”.\n\n+ We illustrate how to assess for voltage by the *blow-up* of the 4 key precordial leads shown in **Figure 08.4-2**. As per the criteria detailed in Figure 08.1-1 — one adds the *deepest* S wave in leads V1,V2 *plus* the *tallest* R wave in V5,V6. The sum = 43 \\(ie, 20 \\+ 23=43\\) — but since the patient is *under* 35 years of age — voltage for LVH is *not* present \\(*Section 08.7*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.4-2:** *Blowup* of selected precordial leads from Figure 08.4-1 to illustrate how QRS amplitude is counted. The ***deepest* S wave** in V1,V2 is **20** \\(*in lead V1*\\) **\\+** the ***tallest* R wave** in V5, V6 \\(= **23** *in lead V5*\\) is **\u003e35** – BUT – because the patient is *less* than 35 years of age — voltage for LVH is *not* present.\n\n**08.5 – *Standardization* Mark: *Is Standardization Normal?***\n\nMost of the time — the ECG will be set to ***normal* standardization**. Confirmation that this is the case is easily achieved by recognition of the ***standardization* mark** at the very beginning or end of the 12-lead recording \\(*black arrow at the onset of lead III in* Figure 08.4-1\\).\n\n+ ***Normal* standardization** is designated by a *rectangular* standardization mark that is **10 mm** \\(=*2 large boxes*\\)** tall**. \n+ On occasion — ECG complexes may be extremely large and extend *beyond* the space provided for one or more leads on the tracing. Selection of ***half* standardization** reduces waveform amplitude by half — with result that the *entire* complex in each lead will again fit on the ECG recording paper and be seen. \n+ These concepts are illustrated in **Figure 08.5-1** — in which the ***Top* Panel** is a *blow-up* of leads III and aVF from Figure 08.4-1. \n+ IF instead, this ECG was recorded at ***half* standardization** — *actual* QRS amplitude would be *twice* that shown = 10 *vs* 5 in lead III; and 26 *vs* 13 in lead aVF \\(***Lower* Panel** *in* Fig. 08.5-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.5-1:** *Blowup* of Figure 08.4-1 to illustrate the appearance of a **normal** \\(*top*\\) and **half** \\(*bottom*\\) ***standardization* mark**. Actual voltage is *twice* that shown when the ECG is recorded at *half* standardization.\n\n**08.6 – LVH: *Additional Voltage Criteria***\n\nNo single voltage criterion will identify all patients with LVH. As a result — we occasionally turn to ***additional* voltage criteria**. We favor *any* of the following:\n\n+ A ***deep* S wave** \\(*≥20-25 mm*\\) in lead **V1** or **V2**. \n+ A ***tall* R wave** \\(*≥25 mm in ****V5*** — or *≥20 mm in ****V6***\\). \n+ An **R wave ≥20** in ***any* inferior lead** \\(*II, III, or aVF*\\). \n+ ***Cornell* Criteria** — LVH is present IF sum of **R** wave in lead **aVL \\+ S** wave in lead **V3** is **≥20**mm \\(*female*\\) or **≥28**mm \\(*male*\\). \n\n \n\n***Bottom* Line:** In our experience, IF all you remember are the numbers ‘**35**’ and ‘**12’** for **LVH *voltage* criteria** — then ***~90%**** of the time* when it is possible to diagnose LVH on the ECG of an ***adult***, you will be able to do so\\!\n\n+ Satisfying *any* of the above ***additional* criteria** should help to pick up most of the remaining ~10%. \n+ Incorporating ***Clinical* History** *and* looking for ***“strain”*** or a strain *“equivalent” *pattern \\(*Section 08.13*\\) — will further refine and increase accuracy \\(*specificity*\\) of your diagnosis. \n+ Keep in mind that ***competing* conditions** \\(ie, *hyperkalemia, acute infarction, conduction defects, pulmonary disease*\\) — may *mask* ECG diagnosis of LVH. \n+ IF you *really* need to know about chamber size — *Get an* **Echo**. The ECG is simply *not* optimally accurate. \n\n \n\n**08.7 – LVH: *Voltage Criteria for Patients Less than 35***\n\nYoung adults often have increased amplitude *not* due to true chamber enlargement. As a ***“ballpark”* estimate** for LVH voltage criteria when the patient is **35 years old** — We use sum of the *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 \\+ *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 **≥53**. This number ‘53’ can be easily remembered — because it is the *reverse* of the number ‘35’.\n\n+ Look at the selected precordial lead sequence shown in **Figure 08.7-1** \\(*previously shown in* Fig. 08.4-2\\). Sum of the *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 \\(**20**\\) \\+ *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 \\(**23**\\) = **43** mm. \n+ We were initially told \\(*in Section 08.4*\\) — that these leads were obtained from a 29-year old man. In this case — voltage criteria for LVH would *not* be met \\(*the patient is under 35 — *and* the voltage sum is less than 53*\\). \n+ On the other hand, IF this patient was over 35 — then voltage criteria for LVH *would* be satisfied \\(*since the voltage sum is more than 35*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.7-1:** Selected precordial leads reproduced from Fig. 08.4-2. Is there voltage for LVH \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***KEY* Point:** There is no “magic” per se about becoming 35 years old and suddenly satisfying voltage criteria for LVH. The age “cutoff” is far from precise. That said, it is helpful to be aware that more often than not when a *healthy* adult under 35 manifests *increased* QRS amplitude but *without* ST-T wave changes of “strain” — most of the time there is *not* true chamber enlargement.\n\n**08.8 – FIGURE 08.8-1: *Which Leads for What with LVH?***\n\nIn an attempt to *expedite* ECG recognition of LVH — We suggest use of **Figure 08.8-1**. This figure highlights our two favored LVH voltage criteria \\(*Section 08.1*\\):\n\n+ LVH by **“35”** — We look for *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 **\\+** *tallest* R wave in V5,V6. If ≥35 = **LVH**. \n+ LVH by **“12”** — If the R wave in lead aVL ≥12 = **LVH**. \n+ We then look for **LV “strain”** or a **strain *“equivalent”*** \\(*Section 08.13*\\) — in one \\(*or more*\\) of the ***left-sided* leads** = I,aVL; V4,V5,V6. \n+ For **LAE** — *Look at* lead II \\(*notched P wave*\\) and/or lead V1 \\(*deep negative component to the P in V1*\\). \n+ For **RAE** \\(*not shown on this Figure*\\) — *Use* lead II \\(*Sections 08.19*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.8-1:** Chamber Enlargement: *Which leads for what? *\n\n**08.9 – LV “Strain”: *ECG Recognition ***\n\nIt is difficult to define ***“strain”***. We conceptualize the ECG picture of *“strain”* as — a pattern of ***asymmetric *ST-T depression** \\(Figure 08.9-1\\). Perhaps “strain” simply reflects that point of anatomic ventricular enlargement at which increased demand \\(*from chamber thickening*\\) outstrips blood supply — with *resultant* ST-T wave repolarization changes from *suboptimal* perfusion. *Or perhaps not*. That said — What counts clinically is ECG *recognition* of a ***“strain”* pattern**.\n\n+ Note how *downslope* of the ST segment in Figure 08.9-1 is *slower* with ***“strain” ***\\(*arrow in ***Panel C**\\) — compared to the *more rapid return* of the ST segment to baseline. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.9-1:** ST-T wave appearance of normal \\(**A**\\) — vs “strain” \\(**C**\\) *or a* strain “equivalent” \\(**B**\\) — vs ischemia \\(**D**\\).\n\n***Pattern* Recognition: **The concept of *pattern recognition* is essential to ECG diagnosis. Consider the following:\n\n+ With **ischemia** \\(*seen in* **Panel D** *of* Figure 08.9-1\\) — there will often be ***symmetric *T wave inversion** in two or more leads in a general lead area. \n+ NOTE: As one traces the path in Figure 08.9-1 from a *normal *ST-T wave \\(*seen in* **Panel A**\\) — to the ***asymmetric *ST-T wave** typical of **LV “strain”** \\(*seen in* **Panel C**\\) — one passes through an ***intermediate* stage**, where the ST-T wave *flattens* with beginning ST depression \\(**Panel B**\\). We designate this intermediate stage as a ***strain equivalent”***. \n\n \n\n\n\n***Terminology: ***In general, when we use the term ***“strain”*** — We are referring to **LV “strain”** that develops in response to ***L****eft ****V****entricular* **H**ypertrophy \\(*LVH*\\).\n\n+ There is also **RV “strain”** — that typically develops in association with *marked* RVH or in response to acute *pulmonary* embolus. For now — *Think ****LV “strain”*** when we use the *unspecified* designation of “strain” \\(*RV “strain” is discussed in Sections 08.28, 08.29*\\). \n\n \n\n***Which* are the Leads that may show LV “Strain”?**\n\nWe expect to see **LV “strain”** in **leads** that ***look*** at the ***left* ventricle**. These include one \\(*or more*\\) of the ***lateral* leads** I,aVL; and V4,V5,V6 \\(*highlighted by green boxes in* Figure 08.8-1\\).\n\n+ *Less *often — a typical **LV “strain”** pattern \\(*with asymmetric ST-T wave depression*\\) may also be seen in the ***inferior* leads** — especially if the patient has a relatively vertical \\(*inferior*\\) axis. \n+ **LV** “strain” — is generally *not* seen in *anterior* leads \\(*V1,V2,V3*\\). In contrast, **RV “strain”** \\(*as may occur with RVH or acute pulmonary embolus*\\) — typically is seen in either *anterior* or *inferior* leads \\(*See Section 08.29*\\). \n\n \n\n**FIGURE 08.9-2: *Which Leads Show LV “Strain”?***\n\nThe ECG in Figure 08.9-2 was obtained from a patient with longstanding hypertension. There is ***obvious* voltage** for **LVH** \\(*very deep S wave in V2 \\+ very tall R wave in V6*\\).\n\n+ ***Which*** of the 5 ***lateral* leads** manifest ST-T wave changes consistent with “strain”? \n+ Explain the ST-T wave depression seen in each of the ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.9-2:** ECG from a patient with longstanding hypertension. *Which* leads show ST-T wave changes consistent with LV “strain”? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.9-2:** The rhythm is sinus. As stated — there is *obvious* voltage for LVH \\(*very deep S wave in V2 \\+ very tall R wave in V6*\\).\n\n+ ST-T wave changes consistent with **LV “strain”** are clearly seen in **lead V6** of Figure 08.9-2. We would interpret the *flat* ST segment with slight T inversion in **lead V5** as a ***“strain equivalent”*** \\(*Section 08.13*\\). *Neither* aVL *nor* lead V4 manifest “strain” \\(*upright T wave in these leads*\\). The *nonspecific* ST-T wave flattening in lead I might be a strain “equivalent” — albeit *minimal* QRS amplitude in this lead makes this supposition less convincing. \n+ **NOTE:** *Asymmetric* ST-T wave depression in *each* of the ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) in this tracing looks typical for **LV “strain”** \\(*closely resembles* **Panel C** *in* Fig. 08.9-1\\). Given the relatively vertical axis \\(*about \\+75 degrees*\\) — it is far *more* likely that these inferior ST-T wave changes reflect LV “strain” rather than ischemia \\(*especially if the patient is not having new or recent chest discomfort*\\). Thus, the ECG in Fig. 08.9-2 appears to represent an example of the occasional occurrence of LV “strain” in *inferior* as well as lateral leads. \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* NOTE in Figure 08.9-2 — that the **ST segment** is ***elevated*** in **leads V2,V3**.\n\n+ Is this likely to reflect an ACS \\(*Acute Coronary Syndrome*\\)? \n\n \n\n**Answer:** As will be discussed in detail in Sections 09 and 10 — ST segment deviations \\(*elevation or depression*\\) are most often judged with respect to the *preceding* PR segment baseline. With this in mind — there unmistakably is *at least* 2 mm of ST elevation in leads V2,V3. That said — it is highly ***unlikely*** that this ***anterior* ST elevation** represents **ACS** because:\n\n+ There is *no mention* of chest discomfort in this patient with longstanding hypertension. \n+ In patients with LVH *and* “strain” — there will often be several mm of ST elevation in *anterior* leads as a ***mirror-image*** reflection of *lateral* precordial “strain”. Note that IF you *flipped over* the ECG complex in lead V6 of Figure 08.9-2 \\(*very tall R wave; ST-T changes of strain*\\) — that the result would be *identical* to what is seen in leads V2,V3 \\(*very deep S wave; mirror-image ST-T wave appearance of what was seen in V6*\\). \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** In addition to ST-T wave depression that may be seen in one or more of the *lateral* leads with LV “strain” — *slight* ST elevation \\(*with mirror-image appearance to the ST-T wave in lateral leads*\\) may also be seen in *anterior* leads. \n\n \n\n**08.10 – LV “Strain”: *Voltage for LVH vs True Chamber Enlargement***\n\nThe reason it is important to recognize ***“strain” ***— is that this finding *greatly* increases the *accuracy* of the ECG diagnosis of LVH.\n\n+ The presence of *increased ***voltage *without* “strain”** — has *low *specificity \\(*50%*\\) for *true* chamber enlargement \\(*especially if the patient is otherwise healthy and without underlying heart disease*\\). We interpret the finding of *increased* voltage *without* ST-T wave changes of “strain as **“Voltage for LVH”**. This designation serves to acknowledge that *despite* an increase in QRS amplitude — *statistical* likelihood of true chamber enlargement is low. \n+ **NOTE:** On occasion there may be *typical* ST-T wave changes of **LV *“strain”*** — but ***without* voltage** for** LVH**. The ECG is simply *not* that sensitive for demonstrating increased QRS amplitude in patients with anatomic LV chamber enlargement. While we do not advise making a definitive ECG diagnosis of “LVH” in the absence of voltage criteria — We may nevertheless *suspect* LVH rather than ischemia in the presence of *asymmetric* ST depression IF: **i\\)** the history does *not* sound like there is cardiac chest pain; and **ii\\)** the patient has one or more conditions predisposing to LVH. Clearly — *Clinical correlation is needed*. \n\n \n\nAssess the ECG in **Figure 08.10-1** for LVH. We previously encountered this tracing in Figure 08.4-1 — at which time we were told that it came from a 29-year old man. Despite sum of *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 \\+ *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 being \u003e35mm — the patient’s age \\(ie, *less than 35 years old*\\) meant that voltage criteria for LVH were *not* fulfilled.\n\n+ BUT — What IF instead of a 29-year old man, this ECG had been obtained from a **40-year old man**? Would there *now* be voltage for LVH? \n+ **NOTE:** ST-T waves are normal in all lateral leads in Figure 08.10-1 — such that there is *no* indication of LV “strain”. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.10-1:** ECG previously seen in Fig. 08.4-1. Is there ***voltage*** for** LVH?** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.10-1:** IF instead of being 29, the patient was **40** — then the ECG in Fig. 08.10-1 would meet ***voltage* criteria** for **LVH**. That said — the *absence* of any ST-T wave indication of “strain” means that the chance of *true* chamber enlargement is still low. This is especially true if this 40-year old man was previously healthy with normal blood pressure.\n\n**08.11 – FIGURE 08.11-1: *Is there True Chamber Enlargement?***\n\nContrast the ECG just shown in Figure 08.10-1 — with the 6 precordial leads in **Figure 08.11-1**. These precordial leads were obtained from an *older* adult with *longstanding* hypertension.\n\n+ Is there LVH? What is the likelihood of *true* chamber enlargement? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.11-1**: Precordial lead sequence obtained from an *older* adult with *longstanding* hypertension. What is the likelihood of *true* chamber enlargement?\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.11-1:** QRS amplitude is *markedly* increased in the 6 precordial leads shown — easily satisfying ***voltage* criteria** for **LVH** \\(*Section 08.1*\\). In addition — note ST-T wave changes consistent with **LV “strain”** in leads V4,V5,V6*. Specificity* for LVH has got to be *close to* 100%.\n\n***KEY *Point:** Once **“strain”** *and*** voltage** are *both* present — ***specificity*** for *true* chamber enlargement goes way up \\(*to ****~90%*** — and* \u003e95% if the patient has underlying heart disease*\\). This is seen in Figure 08.11-1.\n\n+ ECG diagnosis of **LVH** *plus*** “strain”** is *not* a trivial one. The Framingham study demonstrated up to an **8-fold *increased* morbidity/mortality** in patients with longstanding hypertension when there was evidence of LVH *with* “strain” on their office ECG tracing. \n\n \n\n**08.12 – Can there be *both* LV “Strain” *and* Ischemia?**\n\nClinically — *both* **ischemia** *and*** “strain”** may exist at the same time. Patients with LVH from longstanding hypertension may also have coronary disease. If anything — such patients are at *greater* risk of ischemia/infarction.\n\n+ The **ECG changes** of *either* ischemia or “strain” ***may mask*** the **other**. In some patients — *symmetric* T wave inversion may predominate. In others — J-point depression with *asymmetric* ST segment sagging may be more prominent. Distinguishing between *acute* ischemia vs “strain” may be extremely challenging \\(*if not impossible*\\) from review of a *single* ECG tracing. \n+ **NOTE:** When history and ST-T wave appearance suggest that *both* LV “strain” and ischemia are present — We *often* write the following on our interpretation: **“LVH *and* strain *and/or* ischemia. *Suggest clinical correlation”***. This is precisely what we would write for interpretation of the precordial lead sequence shown in **Figure 08.12-1**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.12-1:** Precordial lead sequence obtained from an *older* adult with a history of coronary disease. We would *write* the following for our interpretation: **LVH *and* “strain” *and/or *ischemia** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Figure 08.12-1: *Additional *Points of Interest**\n\n+ Note that ***standardization*** is **normal** in Fig. 08.12-1 \\(*arrow at the end of V4 indicating the rectangular standardization mark is 2 large boxes tall as it should be*\\). \n+ Note ***slight* variation** in **S wave *depth*** in **lead V2**. Such slight variation is common. We sometimes adjust for it by taking an *average* for amplitude in a given lead. \n+ Note ***overlap*** \\(*within the red circle*\\) of the **S wave** from **V4** *with* the **R wave** in **V5**. We could have eliminated this by recording the tracing at *half* standardization. That said — *most* of the time we prefer normal standardization. The point to emphasize is that caution is needed in determining *true* R wave amplitude in lead V5 of **Figure 08.12-1**. \n\n \n\n***KEY *Points: *Comparing* Figs. 08.11-1 and 08.12-1:**\n\nOur interpretation of ST-T wave appearance in Figure 08.12-1 contrasts with that from Fig. 08.11-1. The best way to highlight this contrast is by *side-to-side* comparison of both tracings \\(**Panels A** *and* **B** *in* **Figure 08.12-2**\\):\n\n+ In *both* **Panel A** *and* **Panel B** — *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 \\+ *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 *easily* satisfy ***voltage* criteria** for **LVH**. \n+ In **Panel A** — ST-T wave appearance in leads V5,V6 strongly suggests **LV “strain”** \\(*there is asymmetric ST depression with slow sagging downslope*\\). \n+ In contrast, for **Panel B** — ST segments are *coved* in V3-through-V6. In addition, there is 1-2 mm of J-point ST depression \\(*below the PR segment baseline*\\) in leads V4,V5,V6 — with **T wave inversion** that is ***deep*** and appears to be much ***more* symmetric** \\(*especially in leads V4,V5*\\). This appearance is *more* suggestive of **ischemia**. \n+ In particular — **lead V3** in **Panel B** looks **ischemic** \\(*pure LV “strain” virtually never produces ST coving and symmetric T inversion this far anterior*\\). \n+ **Lead V6** in Panel B — has an *intermediate* appearance between “strain” *and/or* ischemia. Given that this patient is “older” and has a history of heart disease and *decidedly* meets voltage criteria for LVH — We would interpret this tracing as, **“LVH *and* “strain” *and*/*or* ischemia.”** *Clinical* correlation and *comparison* with prior tracings would be needed to determine IF an *acute* ischemic process might be ongoing. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.12-2:** Comparison of the precordial lead sequence from Figure 08.11-1 \\(**Panel A**\\) with that from Figure 08.12-1 \\(**Panel B**\\). Voltage criteria for LVH are easily satisfied in each tracing. ST-T wave changes in Panel B are much more suggestive of LVH *with* ischemia *and/or* “strain” \\(*See text*\\).\n\nReturn to **Panel A** in Figure 08.12-2. Note that the J-point appears to be slightly *depressed* in leads V4-through-V6, and that there is subtle ST *coving* in the depressed ST segment in V4. Thus, although the overall picture in Panel A is clearly *more* suggestive of LVH with “strain” — We can *not* exclude the possibility of some component of ischemia.\n\n+ *Clinical correlation is needed*. \n+ Availability of *prior* tracings on this patient would help to determine whether J-point depression in Panel A is new or old. In the meantime — Interpreting ST-T wave changes in **Panel A** as consistent with ***“strain and/or ischemia”*** with need for *clinical* correlation is appropriate. \n\n \n\n**08.13 – Strain “Equivalent” Patterns: *Clinical Implications***\n\nAs discussed in Section 08.9 — an intermediate ***“strain equivalent”*** stage exists, in which the ST-T wave is *not* completely “normal” — but does *not yet* manifest full appearance of the *asymmetric* sagging ST segment characteristic of “strain”. We expand on this concept in **Figure 08.13-1**:\n\n+ Clinical implications of **LVH voltage** *plus* a ***“strain equivalent” ***\\(*any of the 3 examples shown below in *Figure 08.13-1\\) — are the same as they are for the fully developed pattern of **“strain”** \\(=*greatly increased specificity for LVH *— and *a worse longterm prognosis*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.13-1:** Examples of *“strain equivalent”* patterns \\(*See the illustrative ECG shown below in* Figure 08.13-2\\).\n\n**FIGURE 08.13-2: *Is there LVH with “Strain”?***\n\nApply the concept of recognizing an ST-T “strain equivalent” pattern to the precordial lead sequence shown in **Figure 08.13-2**, taken from a middle-aged man with hypertension.\n\n+ Are ECG criteria for LVH satisfied? If so — What is the likelihood of *true* chamber enlargement in Fig. 08.13-2? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.13-2:** Precordial lead sequence from a patient with hypertension. Is there LVH? What is the likelihood of true chamber enlargement? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.13-2:** Voltage criteria for LVH are satisfied — as sum of *deepest* S wave in V1,V2 \\+ *tallest* R wave in V5,V6 is \u003e35 \\(ie, *17 \\+ 21 = 38*\\).\n\n+ The ST-T wave segment in *lateral* leads V4,V5,V6 is *not* normal. Instead — there clearly is flattening of the ST segment and T wave, with a hint of ST depression. That said — a fully developed pattern of LV “strain” is *not* seen. \n+ **Impression:** The ST-T wave in leads V4,V5,V6 of Figure 08.13-2 closely resembles the 3rd ***“strain equivalent”* pattern** shown in the lower panel of **Figure 08.13-1**. In view of the history \\(*hypertension*\\) and more than adequate voltage for LVH — we would write **“LVH”** \\(*not just ‘voltage’ for LVH*\\) on our interpretation. The likelihood of *true* chamber enlargement is high. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**08.14 – *Atrial* Enlargement**\n\n\n\nThe ECG is *neither* sensitive *nor* specific for ***atrial *enlargement** \\(*Echo is far more accurate*\\). That said — there *are* times when the ECG may provide *suggestive* clues which clinically are very helpful \\(Figure 08.16-1\\):\n\n+ Recognition of **LAA** \\(***L****eft ****A****trial ****A****bnormality*\\) — may ***support*** the ECG diagnosis of **LVH** \\(*especially in the presence of underlying BBB*\\). \n+ Recognition of **RAA** \\(***R****ight ****A****trial ****A****bnormality*\\) in association with other ECG signs — may strongly ***suggest *RVH** \\(*and/or pulmonary hypertension*\\). It may also suggest acute pulmonary embolus. \n+ ECG signs of ***multichamber *enlargement** \\(*at least LVH, LAA, RAA *— *and possibly also RVH*\\) — when seen in a patient with underlying heart disease ***suggests *cardiomyopathy**. \n\n \n\n**08.15 – Terminology: *Enlargement *vs* Abnormality?***\n\nMany clinicians use LAA/RAA — and LAE/RAE *interchangeably*. We prefer the terms, **“LAA”** and **“RAA”** \\(*where the ****“A”**** stands for ****A****bnormality*\\) in acknowledgement that an ***abnormal-looking *P wave** on ECG does *not* always mean true *atrial *chamber enlargement. It simply means a *different-than-usual* P wave appearance.\n\n+ ***Other* Reasons** for ***Abnormal* P Waves** — include body habitus \\(*tall, peaked P waves may be seen in slender individuals with a vertical axis*\\); increased atrial pressure \\(ie, *from heart failure*\\) and intra-atrial conduction defects. \n+ Clinical context will usually suggest whether RAA/LAA is likely to reflect *true* atrial “enlargement” — or *something else. * \n+ IF we *know* true atrial chamber **E**nlargement is likely \\(*because of marked LVH or RVH on ECG in a patient with underlying heart disease*\\) — then we may switch to the LA“**E**” or RA“**E**” designation. Otherwise — we generally prefer to use the terms LA“**A**” or RA“**A**”. \n+ **NOTE:** The atrial do not *“hypertrophy”*, in that their walls don’t thicken. Instead — the atria enlarge \\(*dilate*\\). \n\n \n\n**08.16 – FIGURE 08.16-1: *ECG Criteria for RAA/LAA***\n\nECG Criteria for the diagnosis of RAA and LAA are summarized pictorially in **Figure 08.16-1**. Note that the 2 leads used to assess for atrial abnormality are lead II and lead V1.\n\n+ We explore the *physiologic* rationale for these ECG criteria in Section 08.17. \n+ We discuss specific ECG findings suggesting RAA and LAA in detail in Sections 08.18-through-08.20. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.16-1:** ECG signs of atrial abnormality/enlargement \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**08.17 –* Physiologic Rationale for Normal P Wave Appearance***\n\nPhysiologic rationale for the ECG signs of atrial enlargement is based on: **i\\)** *anatomic* location of **lead V1** \\(*the V1 electrode lies over the RA = right atrium*\\) — and — **ii\\)** *relative* direction of RA and LA depolarization with respect to the SA node \\(**Figure 08.17-1**\\).\n\n+ With** NSR** \\(***N****ormal ****S****inus ****R****hythm*\\) — the impulse begins in the **SA Node** — which lies in the upper part of the right atrium \\(**Panel A** *in* Fig. 08.17-1\\). ***Activation*** of the **RA** will therefore be seen as *approaching* lead V1 — whereas activation of the **LA** will be seen as *moving away* from lead V1 \\(*red arrows in* **Panel B**\\). This explains why in theory — the **P wave** in **lead V1** should normally be ***biphasic***, with an initial *positive* component \\(*as the RA is depolarized*\\) — followed by a *negative* component \\(*as the LA is depolarized*\\). \n+ In Practice — the ***normal* P wave** in** lead V1** may be positive, negative or biphasic \\(*as is shown under NSR in* Fig. 08.16-1\\). \n+ The reason the **P wave** is normally ***upright*** in **lead II** with sinus rhythm is shown in **Panel C** of Figure 08.17-1. Summation of RA and LA activation is seen as *moving toward* **lead II** at \\+60 degrees \\(*red arrows in* Panel C\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.17-1:** *Physiologic* basis for why with **NSR** \\(*Normal Sinus Rhythm*\\) — the P wave in lead V1 may be positive, negative or biphasic \\(Panel **B**\\) — whereas in lead II, the *normal* P wave will be upright \\(Panel **C**\\).\n\n**08.18 – A *Closer* Look: *The P Wave with Normal Sinus Rhythm***\n\nAppreciation of the concepts illustrated in Figure 08.17-1 facilitates an understanding of normal sinus P wave appearance in leads II and V1 — as well as an understanding of what happens to P wave appearance in these same leads with RAA/LAA.\n\n+ With** NSR \\(*N****ormal ****S****inus ****R****hythm***\\)** — the P wave in lead II should be upright \\(**Figure 08.18-1**\\). However — the P wave may *normally* be upright, negative or biphasic in lead V1. \n+ Realize that IF there are 2 components to the P wave in lead V1 — the 1st component \\(*which will be positive*\\) represents RA depolarization \\(*since the sinus node is in the RA*\\). The 2nd component \\(*which is negative*\\) — represents LA activation. It is this 2nd \\(*negative*\\) component that gets larger when there is LAA \\(*Section 08.20*\\). \n+ ***KEY* Point:** The finding of a *negative* P wave in lead V1 is *not* abnormal. It does *not* necessarily mean the left atrium is large IF this negative component to the P wave is relatively small \\(*Section 08.20*\\). \n+ ***Clinical* Note:** Be aware that *minor* deviation from correct lead placement may alter P wave appearance in lead V1. *Despite* best intentions — the clinical reality is that precordial lead misplacement is relatively common. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.18-1:** ECG appearance of the ***normal* P wave** in** leads II** and** V1**. Note that with sinus rhythm — the *normal* P wave in lead V1 may be upright, negative or biphasic.\n\n**08.19 – ECG Diagnosis of RAA: *P Pulmonale***\n\n**RAA** \\(***R****ight ****A****trial ****A****bnormality*\\) — is diagnosed by the finding of tall ***P****eaked* and ***P****ointed* P waves in the ***P****ulmonary* leads \\(**Figure 08.19-1**\\). Because patients with COPD often have low diaphragms \\(*and therefore an inferior axis*\\) — we think of the ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) as the *“pulmonary”* leads.\n\n+ The P wave should be *half* a large box tall \\(=*2.5mm*\\) — in *at least* one of the *inferior* leads for RAA. \n+ IF the **P wave** in one or more ***inferior* leads** looks ***“uncomfortable to sit on” ****— Think ****RAA****\\!* = **P P**ulmonale. \n+ Most of the time — Lead V1 will *not* be helpful in ECG diagnosis of RAA. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* On occasion — RAA may be suggested by P wave appearance in lead V1 IF the *positive* component of the P wave is pointed. This is true even if this pointed positive component is not quite 2.5 mm tall. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.19-1:** ECG criteria for **RAA** \\(*P pulmonale*\\). Most commonly — ECG diagnosis of RA is made from P wave appearance in lead II \\(*tall, peaked and pointed P wave at least 2.5 mm tall*\\). The P wave looks, *“uncomfortable to sit on”*. On occasion — RAA may be suggested by the finding of a *pointed* positive component to the P wave in lead V1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**08.20 – ECG Diagnosis of LAA: *P Mitrale***\n\n**LAA** \\(***L****eft ****A****trial ****A****bnormality*\\) — is diagnosed by finding an **m-**shaped \\(*notched*\\) and *widened* P wave \\(*≥0.12 second*\\) in a \"**m**itral\" lead \\(*I,II,aVL *\\) — *and/or* a deep *negative* component to the P wave in lead V1 = **P M**itrale \\(**Figure 08.20-1**\\).\n\n+ The reason the P wave becomes *wider* with LAA is that the left atrium is activated *after* the right atrium \\(*since the SA Node is in the RA*\\). It is *addition* of this LA component to the P wave that produces the notch/extra ‘hump’ to form the “M” in lead II. \n+ The best ECG sign of LAA is the finding of a **deep, *negative* component** to the **P wave** in **lead V1** — that is *at least* 1 *little* box deep or wide. \n+ We generally ***undercall* LAA** — because of the overall *poor* specificity the ECG has for atrial enlargement. Remember that *some* negativity to the P wave in lead V1 is a *normal* finding\\! Therefore, it is best *not* to even contemplate an ECG diagnosis of “LAA” — unless the *negative* component to the P wave in lead V1 is definitely *at least* 1 *little* box deep and/or wide. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.20-1:** ECG criteria for **LAA** \\(*P mitrale*\\) in lead II and lead V1. Look for a notched \\(*longer*\\) P wave in lead II — and a deep *negative* component to the P wave in lead V1 \\(*that is at least 1 little box deep and/or wide*\\). It is best to *undercall* the ECG diagnosis of LAA \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**08.21 – FIGURE 08.21-1: *Is there ECG Evidence of RAA/LAA? ***\n\nAssess the ECG in **Figure 08.21-1** for RAA and LAA. Keep in mind that this tracing was obtained from an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic 27-year old man who was seen in the office for an insurance physical.\n\n\n\n**Figure 08.21-1:** ECG obtained from a healthy 27-year old man. Is there ECG evidence for RAA/LAA? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.21-1:** There is sinus arrhythmia. All intervals \\(*PR/QRS/QT*\\) are normal. The axis is *vertical* but still within the normal range of zero to \\+90 degrees. Given the *near* isoelectric QRS complex in lead I \\(*which manifests no more than a minimal net positive deflection*\\) — We estimate the mean QRS axis to be about \\+80 degrees.\n\n+ There is *no* LVH — as the patient is *less* than 35 years of age \\(*Section 08.7*\\). \n+ There is **RAA** \\(*tall peaked and pointed P waves in the ‘pulmonary leads’ — with the P wave in lead II ≥ 2.5 mm*\\). \n+ There is *no* LAA — as the P wave is *not* notched, and there is *no* negative component to the P wave in lead V1. \n+ Regarding **QRST Changes**: There are small *septal* q waves in multiple leads; transition occurs *between* lead V2-to-V3 \\(*which is normal*\\); and ST-T wave changes are unremarkable. \n\n \n\n**Impression:** This ECG is probably *not* abnormal — given that it was obtained from an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic 27-year old man. Use of the term, **“RAA”** — allows us to indicate that the P wave is larger than is normally seen without *“labeling”* this patient as having right atrial pathology. Instead — it is much more likely that the vertical axis and peaked inferior P waves seen here reflect a ***normal* variant** in an otherwise healthy young adult with a *vertical* ECG axis and an anatomically *normal* right atrium.\n\n**08.22 – FIGURE 08.22-1: *Is there ECG Evidence of RAA/LAA?***\n\nThe ECG in **Figure 08.22-1** was obtained from an older adult with heart failure. Assess this tracing for ECG evidence of chamber enlargement.\n\n+ What clinical diagnosis is suggested by the ECG picture shown here? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.22-1:** ECG obtained from an older patient with heart failure. Which cardiac chambers are enlarged? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.22-1:** The rhythm is sinus. The PR, QRS and QT intervals are normal.

This is because the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\) is normally so much larger and *thicker* than the RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) in adults — that it masks even moderate increases in right ventricular chamber size. As a result, many patients with **RVH** \\(***R****ight* ***V****entricular* ***H****ypertrophy*\\) will *not* be identified — IF assessment for chamber enlargement is limited to obtaining an ECG \\(*an Echo is needed to know for sure*\\).\n\n+ **NOTE:** In contrast to adults — ECG diagnosis of **RVH** is often surprisingly *easy* in **children** with congenital heart disease \\(*because relative size of the RV compared to the LV is not nearly as different as it is in adults*\\). \n\n \n\n**08.24 – ECG Diagnosis of RVH: *Simplified Criteria***\n\nDevelopment of RVH may lead to a number of ECG findings. We list these in **Figure 08.24-1**. *None* of these findings alone will accurately predict *anatomic* RV enlargement. Instead — *Several* criteria are needed.\n\n+ Think of the ECG diagnosis of **RVH** as similar to making a ***\"detective\" *diagnosis**. *No single clue solves the mystery*. With regard to ECG interpretation — *No single finding* in Figure 08.24-1 is diagnostic. Instead — determination of RVH is made by **deduction** \\(ie, *from identifying a ****combination**** of the ***ECG findings** *listed in *Fig. 08.24-1\\): \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.24-1:** ECG criteria for RVH. A *combination* of at least *several* of these criteria is needed for accuracy \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** Pulmonary disease *without* frank RVH is common in longterm smokers. Progression to ***cor* pulmonale** \\(*in which there is frank RVH*\\) — represents a relatively *late* stage in the process. Careful search for the ECG findings in Figure 08.24-1 may provide clues to *either* longterm *pulmonary* disease and/or *associated* RVH:\n\n+ Consider ***Pulmonary *Disease** — IF you see 2 or more of the first 5 criteria listed in Figure 08.24-1 \\(*especially IF the patient is a known smoker *or* has other known lung problems*\\). \n+ Suspect pulmonary disease ***plus* RVH** — IF *in addition* you *also* see a ***tall *R wave* in *lead V1 **\\(*with or without ST-T wave changes of RV “strain”*\\). \n+ By Definition — By the time you see clear **ECG evidence** of RVH in an adult — the extent of **RVH** is usually ***marked*** \\(*the patient almost always has end-stage COPD* and/or* pulmonary hypertension*\\). \n\n \n\n**08.25 – ECG Diagnosis: *Review of Specific RVH Criteria***\n\nWhile *no single finding* in Figure 08.24-1 *by itself *is enough to diagnose RVH — seeing ***several* criteria** on a* single *tracing is ***very* suggestive** of **RVH** — especially when seen in a *likely* clinical setting \\(ie, *COPD, longterm asthma, right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension*\\). Over the next few sections — We review specific ECG criteria for RVH:\n\n+ **RAD** \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) — is highly suggestive of RVH when seen in a *likely *clinical setting and in association with *other *criteria listed in Figure 08.24-1. *Few* other conditions produce RAD. This is why we strongly ***suspect* RVH** is *also* present in the patient with cardiomyopathy whose ECG was shown in Figure 08.22-1. In the *clinical* context of heart failure *with* evidence of multi-chamber enlargement on ECG \\(*RAA/LAA/LVH*\\) — the markedly *negative* QRS complex in lead I of Fig. 08.22-1 \\(*which we reproduce below in* **Figure 08.25-1**\\) suggests there is *also* enlargement of the 4th cardiac chamber \\(= *RVH*\\). \n+ **RAA** —** **It is usually easy to recognize the tall, **p**eaked, **p**ointed **P** waves of RAA \\(*Section 08.19*\\). **PEARL:** Only *one* condition produces RAA without at the same time producing RVH \\(*= tricuspid stenosis*\\). Therefore — identifying **RAA** on ECG is an ***indirect* sign** that **RVH** is ***very likely***. This was the case for the patient with cardiomyopathy whose ECG was shown in Fig. 08.22-1 \\(*reproduced below in* **Figure 08.25-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.25-1:** This ECG is *reproduced* from Fig. 08.22-1. The patient has a history of heart failure. The ECG shows **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked P wave in lead II*\\); **LAA** \\(*deep negative component to the P in V1*\\); and **LVH** with “strain” *and/or* ischemia \\(*markedly increased QRS amplitude in precordial leads with ST-T wave changes in V3-through-V6*\\). We strongly suspect a **cardiomyopathy** *with* enlargement of the 4th cardiac chamber \\(= **RVH**\\) because *in addition to* LAA/LVH: **i\\) RAA** is *also* present; and **ii\\)** there is otherwise unexplained ***marked* RAD** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**08.26 – RVH: *Review of Additional Criteria***\n\nSome findings in Figure 08.24-1 are more suggestive of RVH *and/or* pulmonary disease than others. The findings we describe below are *less* specific when seen in isolation — but they may be *diagnostic* when they occur in combination \\(*as we demonstrate in the next few sections*\\). Remember — *Not* all findings are seen in every patient.\n\n+ ***Indeterminate* Axis** — Alterations in lung volume with emphysema often lead to *rightward* and *posterior* axis deviation. As a result — *net* QRS deflection in *both* leads I and aVF may become negative. **PEARL:** IF ever you see an *indeterminate* axis — *Think* **RVH**/**COPD**/**Obesity** \\(*Section 07.8*\\). \n+ **IRBBB** \\(*rSr’ in V1*\\) — The presence of an **r’** \\(*r prime*\\) in **lead V1** suggests that *terminal *electrical activity is directed toward the right. While this ECG sign is often benign and commonly seen as an *isolated* finding in otherwise *healthy* individuals \\(*Section 05.18*\\) — it supports the diagnosis of pulmonary disease/*possible* RVH if seen in association with *other* suggestive findings. \n+ ***Persistent *S Waves** — R wave amplitude normally increases as one moves across the precordial leads \\(*as electrical activity moves toward the left where the larger LV lies*\\). R wave amplitude usually peaks \\(*is tallest*\\) in V4 or V5 — and then drops off \\(*in V5,V6*\\). Normally, there is *not* any S wave at all in V5,V6 — since by this time in the depolarization process all electrical activity is traveling leftward. IF *more* than tiny **S waves** are ***still *present** in **V5,V6** — this implies significant *rightward* activity is still ongoing \\(*Think ****RVH****/****COPD****/****large body habitus***\\). That said — this finding is *not* present in Figure 08.25-1 \\(*although a ~5mm S wave is seen in lead V5 — no S wave at all is seen in lead V6*\\). \n+ ***Low Voltage ***— Air is *not* a good conductor of electricity. The large emphysematous chest of a patient with COPD dampens \\(*reduces*\\) voltage. Technically — ***“low voltage”*** is defined as QRS amplitude **≤5 mm** \\(ie, *≤1 large box*\\) in *all* **6 *limb *leads** \\(*I,II,III; aVR,aVL,aVF*\\). That said — we also use *“low voltage”* as a ***relative *term** when ***overall* QRS amplitude** *subjectively* appears to be reduced. When you see ***“low voltage”*** — *Think ***COPD** \\(*although low voltage may also be seen in hypothyroidism; obesity; pneumothorax; pericardial effusion; *or* as a normal variant*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Using the above definition for ***low* voltage** \\(ie, *the QRS being ≤5 mm in all 6 limb leads*\\) — this ECG finding is *not* all that common. When *low* voltage is seen — it is a ***nonspecific* finding**. That said — IF *low* voltage is noted in the presence of *other* criteria for RVH, this finding *adds support* to the diagnosis of probable *pulmonary* disease \\(*especially in a patient with a history of smoking*\\).\n\n**08.27 –* Schamroth’s* Sign for RVH: *A Null Vector in Lead I ***\n\n*Beyond-the-Core: *We draw attention to an interesting, uncommon finding known as ***Schamroth’s *Sign**. This is the presence of a ***null* vector** \\(*or very small QRS complex*\\) in **lead I** that is *not* due to technical error/lead misplacement \\(**Figure 08.27-1**\\). When seen in the “right” clinical setting \\(ie, *a patient with COPD/pulmonary disease*\\) — then this ECG finding is *highly* suggestive of ***advanced* pulmonary disease** with ***probable* RVH** \\(*especially if other findings in* Figure 08.24-1 *are also present*\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 08.27-1:** Schamroth’s sign. Note the ***“null vector”*** in **lead I**. RAA is also present \\(*tall, peaked P wave in lead II*\\). When seen in a patient with pulmonary disease and *not* due to technical error — Schamroth’s sign suggests disease is severe and that there is *probable* RVH \\(*See also Section 08.33*\\).\n\n**08.28 – RVH: *Tall R Wave in V1; RV “Strain”***\n\nThe 2 findings in Figure 08.24-1 that best *distinguish* between pulmonary disease *with* vs *without* associated RVH are: **i\\)** presence of a *tall* R wave in lead V1; and **ii\\)** presence of RV “strain”.\n\n+ ***Tall R Wave in Lead V1*** — Lead V1 is a *right-sided* lead. As a result, the QRS is normally *negative* in lead V1 \\(*electrical activity moves toward the larger LV and away from V1*\\). IF the **R wave** is ***taller*** than the **S wave** in **lead V1** — this means ***rightward *forces** are ***increased ***\\(*which may be an important sign of RVH*\\). Clinically — by the time a *tall* R wave is seen in lead V1 in an adult with pulmonary disease — the extent of **RVH** is usually ***marked*** \\(ie, *the patient is likely to have end-stage COPD and/or pulmonary hypertension*\\). This is the case in *schematic* **Figure 08.29-1** shown below. \n+ **RV “Strain”** — Just as LV “strain” is a sign of *true *LVH — seeing ***“strain”*** in one or both of the ***right-sided *lead areas** \\(*II,III,aVF *— and/or —* V1,V2,V3*\\) strongly ***supports*** a diagnosis of **RVH** \\(Figure 08.29-1\\). \n\n \n\n**08.29 – *Schematic* FIGURE 08.29-1: *Example of RVH \\+ RV “Strain”***\n\nMost of the ECG criteria for **RVH** are present in ***schematic* Figure 08.29-1**. Note the following:\n\n+ *Marked* **RAD** \\(*negative net deflection in lead I; positive QRS in lead aVF*\\). \n+ **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked P wave that looks “uncomfortable to sit on” in II,III,aVF*\\). \n+ ***Tall* R Wave** in** lead V1** \\(*Section 08.28*\\). \n+ ***Persistence*** of *deep* **S waves** in** V5,V6** \\(*Section 08.26*\\). \n+ Fnally — there is **\"RV strain\"**. Typically** **— RV “strain” is seen in inferior *and/or* anterior leads \\(*both of which are present here*\\). **PEARL:** *Inferior* and/or *anterior* ST-T wave changes as seen in Figure 08.29-1 will often *not* be due to ischemia — *but rather to* RVH *or* pulmonary embolus. The presence of RAD; RAA; *persistent* precordial S waves; and *tall* R wave in lead V1 all suggest that the inferior and anterior ST-T wave changes seen in Fig. 08.29-1 are the result of pulmonary disease. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.29-1:** *Schematic* example of **RVH \\+ RV “strain”**. This ECG picture with virtually *all* criteria from Figure 08.24-1 is *uncommon* in adults — and usually indicates *significant* RVH/*end-stage* COPD *and/or* pulmonary hypertension.\n\n**08.30 – *Schematic* FIGURE 08.30-1: *Example of “Pulmonary” Disease***\n\nPulmonary disease \\(*such as COPD*\\) without frank RVH may sometimes be suggested by ECG. Specifically — we look for the presence of *at least* 2 of the first 5 findings from Figure 08.24-1. This concept is illustrated in ***schematic* Figure 08.30-1**. Note the following:\n\n+ An ***indeterminate* axis** \\(*negative QRS deflection in both leads I and aVF*\\). \n+ **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked P wave that looks “uncomfortable to sit on” in II,III,aVF*\\). \n+ **rSr’** in** lead V1** \\(*Section 08.26*\\). \n+ ***Persistence*** of *deep* **S waves** *throughout* **all *precordial* leads** \\(*Section 08.26*\\). Transition *never* occurs \\(*the R wave never becomes taller than the S wave in the precordial leads*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.30-1:** *Schematic* ECG that *strongly* suggests “pulmonary” disease. Low voltage is *not* seen — but the other 4 criteria from Figure 08.24-1 *are* seen \\(Note *— the axis is indeterminate; there is RAA; an rSr’ in V1; and persistence of precordial S waves*\\).\n\n***Clinical* Note:** There is no definitive ECG sign that “proves” a patient has “pulmonary disease”. Instead — We use this descriptor as a *qualitative* term that may help to explain a *combination* of ECG findings that are likely to be seen in a group of patients with longstanding/severe pulmonary disorders. As stated — the point at which “pulmonary disease” *crosses over* to cor pulmonale with *frank* RVH is often elusive and *not* detectable by ECG. An Echo would be far more informative regarding true *right-sided* chamber size, function and pressures.\n\n+ We suspect ***“pulmonary disease”*** when a longtime smoker presents with an ECG manifesting *at least* 2 or 3 of the first 5 findings in Figure 08.24-1. \n+ Given the presence of 4 of these first 5 findings in *schematic* Figure 08.30-1 — it is certainly possible that such a patient might have frank **RVH** that simply is not yet manifesting a *predominant* R wave in lead V1. The ECG is simply *not* sensitive enough to reliably pick up all cases of RVH. \n+ Remember that the adult LV is about 3 times as thick as the RV. In 3 dimensions — LV mass may normally be up to 10 times greater than normal RV mass. Development of RVH in an adult to the point that it *becomes* evident on ECG \\(*by a predominant R wave in lead V1 *— *as in *Figure 08.29-1\\) — is therefore a *late* sign. \n\n \n\n**08.31 – Pediatric RVH: *A few Brief Thoughts …***\n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* Interpretation of *pediatric* 12-lead ECGs is a specialty unto itself \\(*well beyond the scope of this ePub*\\). Most providers are only infrequently called upon to interpret pediatric ECGs. We therefore limit our comments here to discussion of a few basic concepts:\n\n+ ECG criteria for determining *atrial* abnormality \\(*RAA, LAA*\\) in children are similar to criteria that are used in adults \\(*Sections 08.19, 08.20*\\). \n+ Very *different* criteria must be used for determining ventricular enlargement in pediatric patients. Depending on the *age* of the child being assessed — voltage criteria will vary greatly. \n+ Detailed tables of pediatric norms are found in textbooks on this subject. Suffice it to say that QRS amplitude is often normally increased in the pediatric patient. Technical problems relating to accuracy of chest lead placement on the tiny chest of a small child when ECGs are recorded by nonpediatric providers are common. Determining whether QRS amplitude exceeds limits for age and satisfies pediatric ECG criteria for LVH is far from a simple matter. *Practically* Speaking — the child with symptoms *and/or* a murmur will be referred if there is any suspicion of chamber enlargement. \n\n \n\n***KEY* Point:** As opposed to the difficulty for the *nonpediatric* provider in determining LVH — ***suspected* RVH** is often far easier to surmise on ECG. In contrast to the situation just described for adults \\(*in which LV mass is normally up to 10 times greater than RV mass*\\) — RV mass is *comparable* to LV mass at birth, and tends to *remain* so for the first few years of life. As a result — a proportionately *smaller* increase in RV size is much more likely in children to produce a noticeable change in *net* electrical activity between the two ventricles. RVH is therefore much *easier* to diagnose in young children than it is in adults. Be aware of the following:\n\n+ *Some* degree of **RAD** is common in young children. \n+ The **R wave** may normally be ***taller*** than the S wave is deep in **lead V1** up to *about* **age 5**. By the time a child is 6 years old — the S wave in lead V1 will usually be deeper than the R wave in this lead is tall. \n+ It is common to see *anterior* T wave inversion on the ECG of otherwise healthy children. This ECG phenomenon is known as a ***juvenile* T wave variant**. Symmetric T wave inversion may extend to as far as lead V3 or V4 as a *normal* phenomenon in a young child or early adolescent. *Clinical correlation* is essential to avoid mistaking this normal T wave variant as a pathologic pattern \\(*Section 01.4*\\). \n+ IF in doubt about “norms” — Refer to *age-specific* tables\\! Have a low threshold for consulting with someone having expertise in pediatric ECG interpretation. \n\n \n\n***Pediatric* ECGs: *Is RVH Likely?***\n\nImagine the *schematic* ECGs shown in **Figure 08.31-1** and **Figure 08.31-2** were each obtained from a 2-year old child. *Is RVH likely?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 08.31-1:** *Schematic* ECG from a young child. Although there is a *predominant* R wave in lead V1 — this may normally be seen up to 5 years of age. Lack of other findings suggests this 2 year old probably does *not* have RVH.\n\n\n\n**Figure 08.31-2:** *Schematic* ECG from a young child. RVH is suggested by a *combination* of findings including RAD; RAA; *tall* R wave in lead V1 *with* RV “strain”; and persistent deep S waves in V5,V6 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**08.32 – FIGURE 08.32-1: *Is there RVH?***\n\nThe ECG in Figure 08.32-1 was obtained from an older adult with *new-onset* shortness of breath *thought* to be due to *congestive* heart failure.\n\n+ *What else* do you suspect? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.32-1:** ECG from a patient with heart failure. Is this ECG what you would expect from a patient with *left-sided* heart failure? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.32-1:** The rhythm is sinus tachycardia at ~115/minute. The QRS is narrow. As opposed to the usual picture of *left-sided* heart failure \\(*in which one expects to see LVH with strain*\\) — there is *no* sign on this ECG of LVH. Instead — the tracing strongly suggests ***severe* pulmonary disease** \\(*if not ****frank* RVH**\\):\n\n+ There is ***marked* RAD** \\(*predominantly negative QRS complex in lead I; positive QRS in lead aVF*\\). \n+ **RAA** is present \\(*tall, peaked, “uncomfortable-to-sit-on” P wave in inferior leads that in lead II is clearly \u003e2.5mm*\\). \n+ An ***incomplete *RBBB** is seen \\(*rsR’ in lead V1; S waves in leads I,V6*\\). Note that the r’ in lead V1 is relatively tall. \n+ ***Deep* S waves persist** through to V5,V6. \n+ There are *nonspecific *ST-T wave abnormalities — albeit *not quite* RV strain \\(*and no acute changes*\\). \n\n \n\n**Bottom Line: *ECG Impression*** — The combination of *marked* RAD, *definite* RAA, IRBBB and *persistent* precordial S waves *all* point to a diagnosis of** RVH** for the ECG shown in Figure 08.32-1.\n\n+ **Clinical Impression:** This ECG should make one *rethink* the premise of *left-sided *heart failure as the primary cause of this patient’s *new-onset* shortness of breath. Instead — longstanding/severe ***pulmonary* disease** is likely given the ***combination*** of **ECG findings**. Depending on the history \\(*and comparison with prior ECGs on this patient*\\) — **acute *pulmonary* embolism** might also be considered as a possible diagnosis \\(*See Section 08.34*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* There is also **LAA** in Figure 08.32-1 \\(*very deep negative component to the P wave in lead V1*\\). Whether this reflects anatomic enlargement vs *increased* LA pressure is uncertain. \n\n \n\n**08.33 – FIGURE 08.33-1: *Is there RVH?***\n\nWe conclude this section on RVH with the ECG shown in **Figure 08.33-1**. We have previously seen this tracing \\(*in *Figure 02.17-1\\).\n\n+ Does this ECG suggest *pulmonary* disease? \n+ Is there RVH? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.33-1:** ECG reproduced from Figure 02.17-1. Is there evidence of *pulmonary* disease? Is RVH likely?\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.33-1:** This patient *undoubtedly* has *severe* pulmonary disease \\(*if not frank RVH*\\). We note the following findings:\n\n+ The rhythm is **MAT** \\(*Sections 02.16, 02.17*\\) — as determined by the *irregular* irregularity with multiple *different* P wave morphologies that *change* from beat-to-beat. The presence of MAT is most often associated with *severe* pulmonary disease. \n+ Several of the P wave forms that are seen in lead II are highly suggestive of **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked and pointed P waves in this lead*\\). \n+ There is ***persistence*** of fairly ***deep* S waves** in *lateral* precordial leads. \n+ ***Schamroth’s* Sign** is present — as suggested by the *very* low amplitude r wave with flat ST-T wave in lead I \\(*Section 08.27*\\). \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Impression:** The ECG in Figure 08.33-1 was obtained from a patient known to have COPD. The *combination* of ECG findings noted above should provide insight that the degree of pulmonary disease is severe, if not already associated with RVH and increased pulmonary pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n**08.34 – Acute *Pulmonary* Embolus**\n\n\n\nThe ECG is usually *not* a good tool for diagnosing **acute *pulmonary *embolism** \\(*acute PE*\\). That said — there *are *times when an ECG may strongly suggest the diagnosis *before* V/Q scan or chest CT can be done. ***Acute* PE** should be considered IF:\n\n+ IF the ***clinical *setting** is ***“right****” *\\(*new-onset dyspnea *—* pleuritic chest pain *—* predisposing risk factors *or* previous history of PE or deep venous thrombosis*\\). \n+ IF the patient has ***sinus *tachycardia** \\(*usually seen with large PE, albeit clearly nonspecific for the diagnosis*\\). \n+ Two or more ECG signs of **acute *“right-heart” *strain**. These include: **i\\)** RAD; **ii\\)** RAA; **iii\\)** IRBBB or RBBB; **iv\\)** *Tall* R wave in lead V1; and **v\\)** *Deep* S waves in leads V5,V6 \\(*Section 08.24*\\). \n+ **RV *“strain” ***— as suggested by *asymmetric* ST-T wave depression in *inferior* and/or *anterior* leads \\(ie, *leads II,III,aVF* and/or *V1,V2,V3*\\). Alternatively — there may only be ***nonspecific* ST-T wave changes** \\(*ST flattening; slight ST depression*\\). \n+ *New-onset ***A Fib** \\(*a common but nonspecific finding with acute PE*\\). \n+ History and the ECG are similar to that presented in Section 08.32. \n+ *Possibly *with an*** S1-Q3-T3 *pattern ***…* \\(*Section 08.36*\\). \n\n \n\n**08.35 – Acute PE: *Key Clinical Points***\n\nFrom a clinical perspective — *Acute* PE is ***increasingly* overdiagnosed**\\! Many small \\(*subsegmental*\\) PEs *unlikely* to be of clinical consequence are being identified by ***overuse* of Chest CT** ordered on *lower-risk* patients with atypical symptoms.\n\n+ The ECG is ***unlikely*** to **identify** patients with ***smaller* PEs**. *Don’t expect* to see anything on the ECG of these patients \\(*this may be a blessing in disguise*\\). \n+ *Overall *sensitivity of the ECG for picking up *acute* PE is *poor*. Failure to see any of the ECG signs in Section 08.34 does *not* rule out the possibility of acute PE IF history and clinical features suggest the diagnosis. *Chest CT is needed*. \n+ ***Sensitivity*** of the **ECG** for suggesting the possibility of acute PE is *better* with larger \\(*especially submassive*\\) PEs. One should *at the least* see ***sinus* tachycardia** in such patients — often with ***nonspecific* ST-T wave changes**. Large acute PE is commonly associated with other ECG signs — but these may be subtle and are generally nondiagnostic. \n+ Be aware of the *clinical* significance of **RV “strain”**. The finding of ***anterior* T wave inversion** \\(*in leads V1,V2,V3*\\) in an adult with *new-onset* dyspnea or pleuritic \\(*or atypical*\\) chest pain will much more often be due to ***acute* PE** than to ischemic heart disease. This is especially true IF there is also *inferior* T wave inversion \\(*in II,III,aVF*\\) — as seen in **Figure 08.35-1**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.35-1:** *Schematic* ECG illustrating a series of ECG findings that taken together are *highly* suggestive of ***acute* PE** \\(*Pulmonary Embolism*\\) — especially when seen in a patient with *new-onset* dyspnea. Note **RV *“strain”*** — in the form of *asymmetric* ST-T wave depression seen here in both *inferior* and *anterior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF;* and *V1,V2,V3*\\). In addition — there is **RAD** \\(*the QRS in lead I is markedly negative*\\) — **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked P wave in inferior leads*\\) — ***incomplete* RBBB** \\(*rSr’ in V1; S waves in I,V6*\\) — and **persistent *precordial* S waves** that remain *deep* up to leads V5,V6.\n\n**08.36 – FIGURE 08.36-1: *Should You Look for an *S1-Q3-T3?**\n\nOver the years — much attention has been focused on the diagnostic utility of recognizing an ***S1-Q3-T3* pattern** as an ECG indicator of ***acute* PE**. While important to be aware of what a *“positive S1-Q3-T3 pattern”* is — We feel this ECG sign is *highly* overrated. Our reasons for stating this are given below.\n\n**What is a *Positive* S1-Q3-T3 Sign?**\n\nWe define an S1-Q3-T3 pattern — as the presence of: **i\\)** an S wave in lead I; **ii\\)** a Q wave in lead III; and **iii\\)** T wave inversion in lead III \\(**Figure 08.36-1**\\):\n\n+ In order to be valid — all 3 of these ECG indicators must be present\\! That is — **lead III** *must* show both a **Q wave** and an ***inverted* T wave**\\! The presence of only 2 ECG indicators does *not* qualify as a positive S1-Q3-T3 pattern. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.36-1:** S1-Q3-T3 Pattern — as recognized by the presence of: **i\\)** an S wave in lead I; **ii\\)** a Q wave in lead III; and **iii\\)** T wave inversion in lead III. To be valid — all 3 of these ECG indicators must be present.\n\n**The S1-Q3-T3 Pattern: *Pros and Cons***\n\nBy itself — one can *not* rely on a *positive* S1-Q3-T3 sign as an ECG indicator of acute PE. This is because even in the *best* of studies — *both* sensitivity and specificity of a *positive* S1-Q3-T3 sign for *acute* PE is poor. That is — Failure to see this sign *in NO way* rules out the possibility of *acute* PE.\n\n+ More often than not — you will *not* see an S1-Q3-T3 sign *despite* even large *acute* PE. \n+ We have seen the S1-Q3-T3 sign *many times* in completely *healthy* and *asymptomatic* adults\\! Clearly — these patients do *not* have *acute* PE. \n+ **BOTTOM Line:** Recognition of a ***positive* S1-Q3-T3 pattern** *may* help in the diagnosis of *acute* PE — IF the *positive* S1-Q3-T3 pattern is present in association with *other* suggestive ECG signs and the *“right”* clinical history. But a positive S1-Q3-T3 is *not* helpful by itself — and absence of a positive S1-Q3-T3 on ECG *rules out nothing*. \n\n \n\n**08.37 – FIGURE 08.37-1: *The Cause of Anterior T Inversion?***\n\nImagine the ECG in Figure 08.37-1 was obtained from an adult with *new-onset* atypical chest discomfort and shortness of breath.\n\n+ Given this clinical scenario —* How would you interpret* the ***symmetric* T wave inversion** seen in **leads V1, V2, V3**? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.37-1:** ECG obtained from a patient with atypical chest pain and *new-onset* dyspnea. How would you interpret the *anterior* T wave inversion \\(*arrows*\\) seen here? Note that an S1-Q3-T3 pattern is *not* present \\(*there is an S1-Q3 but no T3 as highlighted by the blue-white circle*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.37-1:** The rhythm is sinus. There is **RAD** \\(*the QRS complex in lead I is predominantly negative*\\) — **RAA** \\(*tall, peaked and pointed P wave in lead II*\\) — and fairly **deep, *symmetric* T wave inversion** is seen in **leads V1,V2,V3** \\(*arrows in* Figure 08.37-1\\).\n\n+ The finding of *symmetric* T wave inversion in a patient with chest discomfort should *always* prompt consideration of **ischemia** \\(*which we would do in this case*\\). That said — one should *especially* **consider *acute* PE** in this case because: **i\\)** The patient also has *new-onset* dyspnea; and **ii\\)** there are *other* signs suggestive of *acute* “RV strain” on this tracing \\(*marked RAD; RAA*\\). As a result — ***Acute* PE** would be our **1st diagnosis**\\! \n+ **NOTE:** An **S1-Q3-T3** is ***not* present** in Figure 08.37-1 — because the T wave is *not* inverted in lead III \\(*blue-white circle seen in the lead III blow-up*\\). That said — *lack* of an S1-Q3-T3 pattern should *never* be used alone to rule in *or* out acute PE. While possible ischemia must be considered — the history of *new-onset* dyspnea and this ECG showing *anterior* T wave inversion *plus marked* RAD and RAA makes *acute* PE our working diagnosis *until* proven otherwise. \n\n \n\n**08.38 – FIGURE 08.38-1: *Is there Acute Anterior STEMI?***\n\nThe ECG in Figure 08.38-1 was obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock, and acute hypoxemia. In addition to **RBBB** \\(*QRS widening with an rSR’ in V1 and S waves in I,V6*\\) — there is ST coving in V1,V2,V3 and *slight-but-definite* **ST elevation** in **leads V1,V2**.\n\n+ In view of this clinical scenario — Is this ECG suggestive of ***acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\)**?** \n+ *Should you activate the cath lab* based on this tracing? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.38-1:** ECG obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock and acute hypoxemia. Is this ECG suggestive of acute *anterior* STEMI?\n\n**Answer to Figure 08.38-1:** This ECG needs to be interpreted as the “sum” of its parts *in context with* the clinical history. Remarkably *absent* from the history in this patient who presented with syncope, shock *and* acute hypoxemia — is any mention of chest pain. ECG findings in **Figure 08.38-1** include:\n\n+ ***Sinus* tachycardia** \\(*rate ~ 100/minute*\\). \n+ **RBBB** \\(*QRS widening to at least 0.11 second; rSR’ in lead V1; wide S in lead I; subtle-but-present s wave seen in lead V6*\\). \n+ ***Diffuse* ST-T wave changes** \\(*See below*\\). \n+ Presence of an **S1-Q3-T3** pattern as a *supportive* ECG sign \\(**Figure 08.38-2**\\). Although the q wave and T inversion in lead III are admittedly subtle — *each* component of the S1-Q3-T3 pattern is present \\(*red arrows in* Fig. 08.38-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 08.38-2:** We have added *red* arrows to Fig. 08.38-1 to highlight the presence of an **S1-Q3-T3 pattern**. Other ECG findings suggestive of ***acute* PE** given the history include: **i\\)** Sinus tachycardia; **ii\\)** RBBB; **iii\\)** *diffuse* ST-T wave changes; and **iv\\)** ST elevation in lead aVR \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Clinical Impression of Figure 08.38-2:** We emphasize — that one can *not* rule out the possibility of acute *anterior* STEMI from the ECG shown in Figure 08.32-2. That said — virtually *all* facets of the history and this ECG can be explained by one *unifying* diagnosis = ***acute* PE**:\n\n+ Patients with *submassive* acute PE commonly present with syncope, shock *and/or* acute hypoxemia. IF these symptoms were the result of *acute* STEMI — We would expect far more extensive ST elevation than is seen in Figure 08.38-2. \n+ In the overall clinical context of this case — the **symmetric *anterior* T wave inversion** with ***diffuse* ST depression** elsewhere \\(*in inferior and lateral precordial leads*\\) is perfectly consistent with ***acute* RV “strain”**. \n+ As expected — ***sinus* tachycardia** is present. \n+ **RBBB** is another common sign of acute RV “strain”. \n+ A *limited* number of conditions produce **ST elevation** that is most ***marked*** in **lead aVR** — but minimal or *nonexistent* elsewhere, with possible exception of lead V1 \\(*See Sections 09.31-through-09.40*\\). One of these conditions is ***acute* PE** \\(*Section 09.33*\\). Note that there is *marked* ST elevation in lead aVR of Figure 08.32-2 \\(*red blow-up box*\\) — with ST elevation otherwise limited to lead V1 and no more than a trace in lead V2. \n+ **BOTTOM Line:** Putting all clues together — ***acute* PE** should be assumed *until* proven otherwise. This patient was found to have a large saddle embolus. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**09.0 – Q-R-S-T Changes**\n\n\n\n**09.1 – FIGURE 09.1-1: *Assessing Q-R-S-T Changes***\n\nThe \"heart\" of ECG interpretation resides with assessing the tracing for ***QRST* Changes**. The purpose of this mnemonic — ***Q-R-S-T ****— *is to ensure a ***systematic* approach** — *so that nothing is left out*. The most common mistake that occurs when a systematic approach is *not* closely followed is to allow more dramatic ST-T wave changes to consume one's attention — while subtler \\(*but equally important*\\) findings go unnoticed. Examples of such* all–too-easy-to-overlook *findings include **failure to recognize** *non-sinus* rhythms; a *dominant* R wave in lead V1; *poor* R wave progression and *subtle *ST-T wave changes.\n\n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** *Always *use a ***Systematic* Approach**. This *not only* prevents overlooking important ECG findings — but also ***saves *time** by *streamlining* and *organizing* your approach \\(**Figure 09.1-1**\\): \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.1-1:** *Systematic* approach for *assessing* **Q-R-S-T** Changes \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**LEAD aVR:** Largely ignored in the past — **Use** of **lead aVR** is now increasingly appreciated as an ***invaluable* adjunct** to ECG interpretation. We fully explore this *advanced* concept in Sections 09.31-through-09.40. In the meantime — We suggest *not* being overly concerned about the ECG appearance in lead aVR:\n\n+ For the most part — assessment of lead aVR is *not* essential to the basics of ECG interpretation \\(*assuming the leads are on correctly and there is no dextrocardia*\\). \n+ ***Beyond-the-Core:*** ECG appearance in **lead aVR** may assist in assessing not only technical errors — but *also* narrow and wide-complex tachycardias; acute coronary syndrome from multivessel or left main disease; pericarditis; pulmonary embolism; and more \\(*See Sections 09.31-through-09.40*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.2 – *Septal* Depolarization: *Reason for Normal Septal Q Waves***\n\nIn Section 05.7 — We introduced the concept of **normal *septal* activation**. Normally — the very first part of the ventricles to depolarize \\(*after the impulse passes through the AV node and Bundle of His*\\) — is the ***left* side** of the ***ventricular* septum**. As a result — septal depolarization ***normally* moves** from ***left-to-right*** \\(*red arrow pointing left-to-right in* **Panel A** of Figure 09.2-1\\).\n\n+ As a result of this initial *left-to-right* direction of *septal* depolarization — ***left-sided* leads** \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\) normally see *initial* ventricular activation as moving *away* — which is why **small *septal* q waves** are often *normally* seen in one or more of the *lateral* leads \\(**Panel A**\\). \n+ In contrast — ***right-sided* leads** \\(*V1,V2*\\) normally view *initial* ventricular activation as coming *toward* the site on the chest where these leads lie. This explains why a **small *initial* r wave** is commonly seen in ***leads* V1, V2** \\(*See lead V1 in* **Panel A**\\). This initial small r wave represents *septal* depolarization. It is *lost* when there is *septal* infarction \\(*See* Figure 09.3-1 — *in Section 09.3*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.2-1:** Normal *septal* activation \\(**A**\\) vs LBBB \\(**B**\\). Septal activation normally begins on the *left* side of the septum — and travels left-to-right \\(*red arrow in* **Panel A**\\). As a result — one normally sees a small r wave in right-sided leads \\(*V1,V2*\\) and small, narrow q waves in one or more of the lateral leads \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\). **RBBB** does *not* change these findings \\(*since the right bundle branch travels down the right side of the septum*\\). In contrast — **LBBB** *reverses* the direction of septal activation \\(*red arrow in* **Panel B**\\). As a result — one should *never* normally see a septal q wave in a *lateral* lead with LBBB, *unless* there has been *septal* infarction \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**What Happens with BBB?**\n\nSince the **RBB** \\(*Right Bundle Branch*\\) travels down the *right* side of the septum — the initial ***left-to-right*** direction of *normal* septal depolarization does *not* change when there is **RBBB** \\(*Section 05.7*\\).\n\n+ In contrast — with **LBBB**, the normal *left-to-right* direction of septal activation will *reverse* because the block with LBBB *prevents* the initial vector of septal activation from starting on the left \\(**Panel B** *in* Figure 09.2-1\\). As a result — ventricular activation with **LBBB** moves almost entirely from ***right-to-left***. This explains why septal q waves should *not* normally be seen with LBBB in *lateral* leads \\(*Sections 05.6-through-05.9*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.3 – *Precordial* Lead Appearance: *What is Normal?***\n\nIn **Figure 09.3-1** — We illustrate normal *precordial* lead appearance by means of a *schematic* cross-sectional \\(*transverse*\\) view of the heart within the thorax:\n\n+ The **small* black *arrow** in Figure 09.3-1 schematically depicts the direction of normal septal depolarization \\(*which moves from left-to-right*\\). \n+ The **large* red *arrow** depicts the general direction of **LV** \\(*Left Ventricular*\\) depolarization \\(*which as seen in *Fig. 09.3-1* is to the left and posteriorly*\\). \n+ The smaller **RV** \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) — predominantly sees electrical activity as moving *away* from the right \\(*and toward the larger and thicker left ventricle*\\). This explains why the QRS complex in ***right-sided* precordial leads** \\(*V1,V2*\\) is normally predominantly *negative* — whereas the QRS in ***left-sided* leads** \\(*V5,V6*\\) is generally positive. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.3-1:** Transverse \\(*cross-sectional*\\) view of the heart — illustrating *precordial* lead appearance in leads V1-through-V6. Note that transition occurs *between* lead V2-to-V4. There is ***overlap*** between leads viewing *septal* — *anterior* — and *lateral* precordial areas. Septal depolarization normally moves left-to-right \\(*small black arrow*\\). The major component of ventricular activation moves to the left and posteriorly \\(*large red arrow*\\) — which reflects the relative size and anatomic position of the left ventricle.\n\n**FIGURE 09.3-1: *Key Clinical Points***\n\n+ Note that there is ***overlap*** in Figure 09.3-1 between leads viewing *septal* — *anterior* — and *lateral* precordial lead areas. That is — **lead V2** is both a septal and anterior lead; **lead V4** is both an anterior and lateral lead. \n+ ***Septal* depolarization** \\(*the small black arrow in *Figure 09.3-1\\) goes *left-to-right. *The normal *small* initial *positive* deflection \\(*r wave*\\) in leads V1,V2 results from *septal* activation coming toward these *right-sided* leads. With ***septal *infarction** — this small *initial* r wave in leads V1,V2 is *lost*. \n+ Small **normal *septal* q waves** — are commonly seen in one \\(*or more*\\) of the ***lateral *leads** \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\). This makes sense — since the ***left****-to-****right*** direction of ***septal *activation** moves *away* from *left-sided* leads \\(*and therefore writes a ****small q wave***\\). \n+ The area where the R wave *becomes* taller than the S wave \\(***Transition***\\) occurs normally in Figure 09.3-1. That is — the QRS is predominantly *negative* in lead V2 — it is *isoelectric* in V3 — and *positive* in V4 \\(*so ****transition**** occurs between leads V2-to-V4, which is normal*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.4 – *Basic* Lead Groups: *Which Leads look Where?***\n\nIt is essential to know *which* leads view *which* areas of the heart. The ***“trained eye”*** keys into specific ***Lead *Groups** \\(Figure 09.4-1\\):\n\n+ In Sections 03 and 07 — we introduced derivation and anatomic correlation for the 6 limb leads in the frontal plane. This includes the 3 ***inferior *leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — the 2 ***high-lateral* leads** \\(*I,aVL*\\) — and the most remote \\(*right-sided*\\) lead, which is **lead aVR**. We expand on these relationships in **Figure 09.4-1**. \n+ Think of the *electrical* viewpoint of **lead aVL** as *looking down* at the heart from perspective of the *left* shoulder. Thus, lead aVL views the heart’s electrical activity from *higher* perspective than *precordial* leads that are placed on the chest. ***Bipolar* lead I** at *horizontal* perspective \\(*corresponding to 0 degree placement in Einthoven’s triangle*\\) — also views the heart’s electrical activity from *higher* perspective than is seen from precordial leads. This is why **leads I** and** aVL** are designated ***“high lateral”* leads** — to be distinguished from *lower lying* lateral precordial leads \\(*V4,V5,V6*\\). \n+ In contrast — Think of the *electrical* viewpoint of **lead aVF** as looking *straight up* from the **F**eet \\(*perpendicular in the frontal plane axis at \\+90 degrees*\\). The other 2 ***inferior* leads** are **lead II** \\(*at \\+60 degrees*\\) and **lead III** \\(*at \\+120 degrees*\\). \n+ The remaining 6 leads are the ***precordial* leads**. Anatomic localization of these 6 chest leads is best understood by reviewing the landmarks used for *performing* an ECG \\(*Section 03.6*\\) in context with the *horizontal* plane view just discussed in Figure 09.3-1. This should explain ***septal ***\\(*V1,V2*\\) — ***anterior ***\\(*V2,V3,V4*\\) — and ***lateral*** \\(*V4,V5,V6*\\) ***precordial* lead** viewpoints for these *unipolar* leads that view the heart’s electrical activity from perspective of their placement site on the chest. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.4-1:** *Basic* Lead Groups. As suggested in Fig. 09.3-1 — there is ***overlap*** in the ***precordial* lead** areas \\(***lead V2**** reflects both septal *and* anterior events; ****lead V4**** reflects both anterior *and* lateral events*\\).\n\n***About* Lead aVR:** — The most remote of the 12 standard leads is **lead aVR**. This *right-sided* lead views the heart’s electrical activity from the distant perspective of the *right* shoulder. Lead aVR is unique for providing a view that assesses the basal part of the interventricular septum. It is also unique in providing a ***mirror-image* view** of ongoing electrical activity throughout the rest of the heart.\n\n+ Note that we do *not* assign a specific number of degrees to the vantage point for **lead aVR** \\(Figure 09.4-1\\). Instead — it suffices to think of this lead as providing a remote *right-sided* view. Lead aVR may show ***reciprocal* changes** to what occurs in other areas of the heart. Diffuse ST depression in multiple leads from subendocardial ischemia in a patient with severe coronary disease — may therefore manifest ***mirror-image* ST elevation** that is *only* seen in **lead aVR** \\(*This concept discussed in detail in Section 09.40*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.5 – R Wave Progression: *Where is Transition? ***\n\nThe **“R”** of our *suggested* **Q-R-S-T** memory aid — serves to remind us to assess *each* tracing for **R Wave Progression**. A typical sequence of R wave progression across the 6 precordial leads is illustrated in **Figure 09.5-1**, which is a *close-up* view taken from the lower part of Figure 09.3-1.\n\n+ Normally the **R wave** becomes ***progressively* taller** as one moves across the precordial leads. The R wave often \\(*but not always*\\) **“tops out”** in lead V5 — and then drops off in amplitude by lead V6. These relationships are shown in Figure 09.5-1. \n+ The easiest way to *quickly* describe evolution of the QRS waveform from a predominantly *negative* complex in V1,V2 — to a predominantly *positive* complex in more lateral precordial leads — is by commenting on the point of **“Transition”**, which indicates the leads *between which* the QRS becomes more positive than negative. Transition *normally* occurs between lead V2-to-V3 — or between V3-to-V4. In **Figure 09.5-1** — Transition occurs ***between* leads V2-to-V4** \\(*since the QRS is predominantly negative in V2 — isoelectric in V3 — and clearly positive by V4*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.5-1:** Close-up of the cross-sectional view shown in Figure 09.3-1 — in which *progression* of QRS complexes in the ***precordial* leads** is shown. Note the *small* r wave in lead V1 and that there are small *septal* q waves in leads V5,V6. R wave amplitude *“tops out”* in V5; ***Transition*** is **normal** \\(*occurs between leads V2-to-V4*\\).\n\n**Where is Transition?**\n\nDetermining the point of transition is easy. It is a highly *reproducible* determination — and *not* subject to *inter-interpreter* variability \\(**Figure 09.5-2**\\). In contrast — there is great variation in the way different interpreters evaluate an ECG for the adequacy of R Wave Progression \\(*Section 09.7*\\).\n\n+ **Transition** is said to be ***Normal*** — IF it occurs *between* leads V2-to-V4 \\(**Panel B** in Figure 09.5-2\\). Regardless of r wave amplitude in the first few precordial leads — the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep by lead V3 or V4. In **Panel B** — transition occurs *between* leads V3-to-V4. \n+ Transition is said to be ***Early*** — IF the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep by lead V2. This is the case in **Panel A** — in which transition occurs *between* leads V1-to-V2. \n+ Transition is said to be ***Late*** — IF the point at which the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep is delayed to *after* lead V4. This is the case in **Panel C** — in which transition occurs *between* leads V4-to-V5. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.5-2:** Transition in the precordial leads. Normal transition occurs *between* leads V2-to-V4 \\(**Panel B**\\) — vs Early \\(**A**\\) or Late \\(**C**\\) transition.\n\n**KEY *Clinical* Points:** There is *no doubt* about where transition occurs for each of the 3 precordial lead sequences shown in Figure 09.5-2. Subjectivity does *not* enter into the definition.\n\n+ **NOTE:** The point of **transition** is a ***descriptive* finding**. The clinical significance of normal, early or late transition — will depend on *other* ECG parameters \\(*as will be discussed shortly*\\). \n+ Our purpose for ***routinely* including** assessment of **R wave *progression*** and the point of ***transition*** in our ***Systematic* Approach** \\(*= the ****“R”**** of Q-R-S-T Changes*\\) — is *not* to overlook the finding of a *disproportionately* tall R wave in lead V1. Careful assessment of precordial lead morphology should *also* pick up: **i\\)** any r’ that might be present in lead V1; and **ii\\)** any Q waves or *loss* of r wave that might occur in precordial leads \\(*Section 09.8*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.6 –* Old* Terminology: *R Wave Progression – CW, CCW Rotation***\n\nECG description of precordial lead QRS appearance has evolved over time. In the past — the term ***“R Wave Progression”*** was universally used to convey *progressive* increase \\(*or lack thereof*\\) of QRS amplitude as one *successively* views the precordial leads.\n\n+ **R Wave Progression** was said to be ***“normal”*** — IF the R wave gradually and *progressively* became taller as one moved across the precordial leads \\(*at least until leads V4,V5*\\). \n+ **PRWP** \\(*Poor R Wave Progression*\\) was said to be present — IF the R wave in lead V1 *through* to leads V3-V4 either did *not* become taller, or only increased *slowly* in size. \n+ Abnormalities in the way the R wave did or did not progress were described by rotation “direction”.** CCW** \\(*CounterClockWise*\\)** rotation** was said to exist in the transverse plane — IF the zone of transition occurred *before* lead V3 — vs **CW** \\(*ClockWise*\\)** rotation** IF transition occurred *after* lead V4. \n\n \n\n***Old *vs* New* Terminology:** Use of the ECG designations of “clockwise” and “counterclockwise” rotation is *outdated*. These terms are *no longer* actively used. We find these terms confusing — because they are based on the unexpected premise of an observer standing at the feet of the patient *looking upward* to envision precordial lead progression of R wave amplitude. We suggest you ***ignore*** the terms ***“clockwise”*** and ***“counterclockwise”* rotation**, which do *not* contribute to meaningful ECG interpretation.\n\n+ In contrast — We have kept the term ***“R Wave Progression”*** \\(*RWP*\\) in our ECG vocabulary, because this term remains *ingrained* in the minds of many ECG interpreters. \n+ ***Clinical* Perspective:** It is better to determine *precordial* lead ***“Transition”*** than to worry about R wave “progression”. The point of transition much more *reproducibly* describes what occurs in the transverse plane \\(*Section 09.5*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.7 – FIGURE 09.7-1: *Poor R Wave Progression***\n\nGiven continued reference by clinicians to “R wave progression” as a component of ECG interpretation — it is essential to appreciate what is meant by the term, **“PRWP”**.\n\n+ **PRWP** \\(*Poor R Wave Progression*\\) — is said to exist IF the R wave does *not* progressively increase as one moves across the precordial leads. A number of conditions may be associated with **PRWP**. We list these in Figure 09.7-1. The problem is that many of the entities on this list are ***clinical* “opposites”** \\(ie, *RVH* vs *LVH*; *normal variant* vs *myocardial infarction*\\). Clinical utility of a term that *fails* to distinguish between opposites is limited. \n+ ***Clinical* Perspective:** The term “PRWP” is clearly suboptimal. That said, *despite* its shortcomings — the designation **“PRWP”** *remains* in active use. Specific indication of *which* precordial leads manifest Q waves \\(*or QS complexes*\\) — and noting the area of *transition* is far better. Nevertheless — You’ll want to be aware of the entities commonly associated with PRWP \\(**Figure 09.7-1**\\): \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.7-1:** Common causes of ***“PRWP”*** — which is said to exist if the R wave does *not* become *progressively* taller as one moves across the precordial leads \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.8 – FIGURE 09.8-1: *Anterior MI vs Lead Placement Error?***\n\nTechnical mishaps and lead placement errors were reviewed in Section 03. Awareness of these technical pitfalls is especially relevant in assessing *precordial* lead R wave progression. For example — Examine the precordial lead sequence shown in Panel A of Figure 09.8-1.\n\n+ Does the precordial lead sequence in **Panel A** make sense? If not — *What might be the cause* of the problem? \n+ **HINT:** Be sure to look *not only* at R wave progression — but *also* at T wave progression in the precordial leads shown in **Panel A**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.8-1:** *Precordial* lead R wave progression in **Panel A** does *not* make sense — because there is abrupt ***loss*** and ***return*** of** r wave** *between* V1-to-V3. Note also what happen to T wave morphology as one moves from V1-to-V2-to-V3 in **Panel A** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.8-1:** When R wave progression is “normal” — there is *gradual* increase in R wave amplitude as one moves across successive *precordial* leads. This is *not* seen in **Panel A** of Figure 09.8-1:\n\n+ A *relatively* tall initial R wave is seen in lead V1. \n+ There is ***loss of R wave amplitude*** between lead V1-to-V2. \n+ R wave amplitude in Panel A *returns* by lead V3. \n+ Although possible that abrupt ***loss*** and ***return*** of** r wave** in **Panel A** could be the result of isolated *anterior* infarction — it is far *more likely* to represent an ***error*** in **lead placement**. Loss and return of R wave amplitude is usually *not* nearly *so abrupt* when due to infarction. \n+ Further support of lead placement error is forthcoming from assessment of changes in T wave morphology. **T wave progression** from lead V1-to-V3 in **Panel A** also does *not* make sense. Normally — the T wave may be negative, flat \\(*isoelectric*\\), or upright in lead V1. The T wave should *not* go from *positive* in lead V1 — to *negative* in lead V2 — to *positive* once more in lead V3 as it does in Panel A. \n+ ***Putting It All Together:*** The precordial lead sequence in **Panel A** would make much more sense IF lead V2 was really lead V1 — and lead V1 was really lead V2. This **technical *lead placement* error** is in fact the cause of the unusual \\(*and unrealistic*\\) R wave and T wave progression seen in Panel A. ***Correct* lead placement** is shown in **Panel B**. R wave and T wave progression is now normal — with transition *between* lead V3-to-V4. \n+ **PEARL:** Another reason for *routinely* including assessment of *transition, R wave progression* and precordial lead appearance in our ***Systematic* Approach** \\(*the ****“R”**** in Q-R-S-T Changes*\\) — is to *avoid* overlooking technical lead placement errors like the one in Figure 09.8-1. \n\n \n\n**09.9 – FIGURE 09.9-1: *What is the Cause of PRWP?***\n\nAs we have emphasized — the designation **PRWP** \\(*Poor R Wave Progression*\\) lacks specificity. That is — *many* conditions may account for relatively *low* anterior r wave amplitude \\(**Figure 09.7-1**\\). The purpose of Section 09.9 and Section 09.10 is to illustrate how integration of the ***overall* ECG picture** facilitates determining *which* of the entities listed in Figure 09.7-1 is likely to be operative.\n\n+ The *schematic* precordial lead sequences in *both* **Panel A** and **Panel B** of **Figure 09.9-1** qualify as manifesting “PRWP”. Contemplate *WHY* we label Panel A as suggestive of COPD — and Panel B as suggestive of lead placement error. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.9-1:** PRWP due to COPD vs placement error \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.9-1:** PRWP is clearly present in the *schematic* 12-lead ECG shown in **Panel A**. No more than a *tiny* initial r wave is seen in leads V1,V2 — and R wave amplitude *remains* small through to lead V6. Transition *never* occurs \\(ie,* the R wave never becomes taller than the S wave is deep*\\).\n\n+ The reason the *schematic* ECG in **Panel A** is *strongly* suggestive of **COPD** — is that *several* additional ECG signs of pulmonary disease are present. These include:** i\\)** RAD \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\); **ii\\)** RAA \\(*Right Atrial Abnormality*\\); and **iii\\)** persistent *precordial* S waves that are still deep in V5,V6 \\(*See Section 08.30 for Review of ECG findings with pulmonary disease*\\). \n+ NOTE:* Despite* “PRWP” for the *precordial* lead sequence in Panel A — ***anterior* infarction** is *far**** less likely*** because: **i\\)** an r wave \\(*albeit a small r wave*\\) is present in *all* precordial leads; and **ii\\)** the ***overall* ECG picture** in **Panel A** *strongly* suggests **COPD**. \n+ In contrast to Panel A — the 6 *precordial* leads in **Panel B** strongly suggest **lead *placement* error**. Abrupt *loss* and *return* of r wave from V1-to-V3 is *not* a logical sequence for *normal* R wave progression — especially given rapid development of a *predominant* R wave by lead V4. Confirmation of technical error should be easy to establish by verifying chest lead placement and then *repeating* the ECG. \n\n \n\n**09.10 – FIGURE 09.10-1: *QS in V1,V2 *vs* Anterior MI?***\n\nTwo final examples of PRWP are shown in Panels B and C of Figure 09.10-1. For comparison — we begin with an example of ***normal* R wave progression** in **Panel A**.\n\n+ Why do we label **Panel B** as suggestive of ***anterior* MI**? \n+ Is the precordial lead sequence in **Panel C** also indicative of *septal* and/or *anterior* infarction? If so — *How likely* is it that *prior* infarction has occurred? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.10-1:** *Normal* RWP \\(*R Wave Progression*\\) is seen in **Panel A**. This is in comparison with precordial lead sequences suggestive of *anterior* MI \\(**Panel B**\\) vs an *indeterminate* pattern showing a QS complex in leads V1,V2 but *not* in V3 \\(**Panel C**\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.10-1:** With *normal* R wave progression \\(**Panel A**\\) — there is *progressive* increase in R wave amplitude across *successive* precordial leads until transition occurs. In Panel A — the R wave “tops out” in lead V5 and transition occurs *between* V3-to-V4.\n\n+ Normally — the QRS complex in **lead V1** is predominantly *negative*, because ventricular depolarization is traveling *away* from this *right-sided* lead. There may \\(*or may not*\\) normally be a small upright *initial* r wave in lead V1. Thus, the fact that a QS \\(*entirely negative*\\) complex is seen in lead V1 of **Panel A** is completely consistent with *normal* ventricular depolarization. \n+ Although tiny — a *small* r wave \\(*positive initial deflection*\\) is seen by **lead V2** of Panel A. \n+ In contrast, in **Panel C** — a **QS pattern** is seen in *both* **lead V1** and **V2**. This may or may not be a “normal” finding. Instead, it could indicate: **i\\)** a *technical* lead placement error; or **ii\\)** *septal* infarction. Since there may not be any reliable way to distinguish between normal variant vs lead placement error vs prior *septal* infarction — We simply acknowledge,*** “QS in V1,V2; Suggest clinical correlation”*** in our interpretation. \n+ Statistically — the odds are far greater \\(*approximately 4-to-1*\\) that *either* normal variant or lead placement error *rather than *septal infarction are the reason for a **QS complex** in **V1,V2** but *not* V3 \\(*as seen in* **Panel C**\\). \n+ It is only when *no r wave at all* is seen in V1,V2 and V3 that prior anterior \\(*or anteroseptal*\\) infarction becomes more likely \\(**Panel B**\\). \n+ Additional support that the precordial lead sequence in Panel B indicates prior *anteroseptal* infarction — is the finding of a *small-but-definite* q wave in lead V4 but *not* in leads V5,V6. If the initial *negative* deflection in lead V4 was a septal q wave — We would also expect to see *similar* small septal q waves in leads V5,V6. \n+ **NOTE-1:** The above comments regarding *clinical* implications of a QS complex in leads V1,V2,V3 hold true *only* when the QRS complex is narrow. QRS widening due to **LBBB** commonly produces QS complexes in anterior leads that are simply the result of the conduction defection and are *not* indicative of *anterior* infarction \\(*Section 05.8*\\). \n+ **NOTE-2:** There are 2 *other* potential reasons for PRWP with a *narrow* QRS complex that are *not* the result of prior infarction. These are: **i\\) LVH**; and **ii\\) LAHB**. Usually at least *some* r wave will be seen by lead V3 with these other conditions — though *not* always. ***Bottom* Line:** It is sometimes extremely difficult to know with certainty the cause of PRWP when R waves in leads V1,V2,V3 are *either* very small or absent. *Clinical correlation is essential*. \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* It is insightful to appreciate the *physiologic* reason why R wave progression is often “poor” in the presence of LVH *and/or *LAHB.\n\n+ **LVH** \\(*Left Ventricular Hypertrophy*\\) — produces an increase in leftward and posterior forces. When marked — these leftward and posterior forces may totally *predominate* over initial rightward and anterior forces seen in leads V1,V2,V3. The result is reduction in r wave amplitude in anterior leads. At times — there may even be elimination of any r wave at all in V1,V2,V3. \n+ **LAHB** \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\) — The bundle of conduction fibers in the LAH \\(*Left Anterior Hemifascicle*\\) lies slightly in front of \\(*anterior to*\\) fibers in the LPH \\(*Left Posterior Hemifascicle*\\). As a result — block in the LAH \\(*as occurs with LAHB*\\) results in an initial *posterior* direction for electrical activity that is first conducted over the intact LPH. The result may once again be reduction in r wave amplitude in the *anterior* leads. \n\n \n\n**09.11 – FIGURE 09.11-1: *PRWP from LVH *vs* Anterior MI?***\n\nExamine the 2 precordial lead sequences shown in Figure 09.11-1. PRWP with *delayed* transition \\(*between V4-to-V5*\\) is seen in both **Panel A** and **Panel B**.\n\n+ What is the *difference* between these 2 precordial lead sequences? \n+ Is *anterior* infarction likely in *either* case? \n+ Does LVH explain all ECG findings? \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Comment on the ST elevation seen in leads V2,V3 \\(*short red horizontal lines in leads V2,V3 in* **Panel B**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.11-1:** LVH with PRWP. Red arrows and circles highlight the difference in R wave progression between **Panel A** and **Panel B**. Is there evidence of *anterior* infarction in one or both cases? Does LVH explain *all* ECG findings? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.11-1:** QRS amplitude is markedly increased in *both* Panel A and Panel B — easily satisfying criteria for **LVH** \\(*deepest S in V1,V2 \\+ tallest R in V5,V6 \u003e35mm*\\). In addition — ST-T wave changes of LV “strain” are seen in lead V6.\n\n+ Both precordial lead sequences in Figure 09.11-1 manifest a **QS complex** in **leads V1,V2** \\(*red arrows*\\). The difference — is that a QS complex is also present in lead **V3** of **Panel B** \\(*red arrow*\\) — whereas a small initial *positive* deflection \\(*r wave*\\) is seen in lead V3 of **Panel A** \\(*red circle*\\). \n+ As emphasized in Section 09.10 — the ECG picture in **Panel A** \\(*QS in V1,V2 but not in lead V3*\\) is far more likely *not* to be due *anterior* infarction. We would therefore write the following as our interpretation: *“LVH and strain; ****QS in V1,V2 of uncertain significance****; Suggest clinical correlation”*. \n+ In contrast — the ECG picture in **Panel B** \\(*QS in V1,V2 and in lead V3*\\) makes it more likely that *anterior* infarction has occurred. That said — QRS amplitude is so greatly increased, that loss of r waves in V1,V2,V3 could be the result of marked LVH. We simply can *not* know for sure on the basis of this single ECG tracing. We would therefore write the following as our interpretation: *“LVH and strain; ****QS in V1,V2 and V3; possible prior anterior infarction;**** Strongly suggest clinical correlation”*. \n\n \n\n**Final Point:** A *subtle-but-real* additional finding in Figure 09.11-1 is the presence of *at least* 2mm of **ST elevation** in leads V2,V3 in *both* Panel A and Panel B \\(*short red horizontal lines in* **Panel B**\\).\n\n+ This ST elevation should be noted. That said — We strongly suspect this ST elevation is *not* indicative of acute injury because: **i\\)** Shape of the ST elevation is concave up = *“smiley”* vs ST coving that is far more predictive of acute injury; and **ii\\)** the ECG picture in the anterior leads is the reciprocal \\(*mirror-image*\\) of what is seen in lead V6. This *mirror-image* picture of concave-up ST elevation in one or more anterior leads is often seen simply as a reflection of LVH in patients without acute infarction. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** R wave progression is a *descriptive* finding. There are *many* potential causes of PRWP \\(*which we listed in* Figure 09.7-1\\). Some of these causes are benign. Some are not. *Clinical correlation* in context with the *overall* ECG picture is needed to determine likely clinical implications when PRWP is noted.\n\n**09.12 – FIGURE 09.12-1: *Normal Q Waves; Normal T Inversion ***\n\nAmong the most challenging tasks for the ECG interpreter — is deciding what is “normal” vs “abnormal”. Our purpose in devising **Figure 09.12-1** — is to facilitate remembering when the finding of even a *large* Q wave or *deep* T wave inversion may be normal.\n\n+ **5** of the** leads** on a *standard* 12-lead ECG \\(= *leads III-aVR-aVL-aVF-V1*\\) — may *normally *display even ***moderate-to-large* Q waves** and/or** T wave inversion** in *healthy* adults who do *not* have heart disease. \n+ Thinking of a ***“reverse Z”*** \\(*à la ****Zorro***\\) — may help to recall which leads these are \\(Figure 09.12-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.12-1:** *“Reverse Z”* memory aid — for recalling the 5 leads that may occasionally display even *large* **Q waves** *and/or* **T inversion** as an *isolated* finding in otherwise *healthy* adults who do *not* have heart disease \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***KEY* Points: *When are Q Waves/T Inversion a Normal Finding?***\n\nTraditionally — the finding of a deep and wide Q wave is thought to be a marker of myocardial infarction. *Other* pathologic reasons for Q waves exist — including cardiomyopathy \\(*scarring/fibrosis*\\); conduction defects and WPW. The purpose of this Section is to highlight instances when Q waves \\(*and associated T wave inversion*\\) may be a *normal* finding.\n\n+ **Normal *septal* q waves** — are common. As reviewed in discussion of bundle branch block \\(*Section 05.7*\\) — Septal q waves are ***small*** and ***narrow***. They arise because the first part of the ventricles to normally depolarize is the *left* side of the septum. As a result — ***left-sided* leads** see the initial depolarization vector as moving *away* from the left as the septum depolarizes from left-to-right. This accounts for the **normal *small* q wave** that may commonly be seen in one or more of the ***lateral* leads** \\(*= leads I-aVL-V4-V5-V6*\\) in *asymptomatic* individuals *without* heart disease. The reason we do *not* include normal *septal* q waves in Figure 09.12-1 is because their small and narrow dimensions makes it obvious that such q waves are *unlikely* to be pathologic. \n+ **Lead aVR** — is normally all negative \\(*negative P wave, QRS and T wave *— *as seen in* Figure 09.12-1\\). Global negativity for lead aVR is logical given the remote *right-sided* location of this unipolar lead \\(*the depolarization vector continually moves away from right-sided lead aVR under normal circumstances*\\). \n+ **Lead V1** in adults — typically shows a QS or rS complex *and* T wave inversion \\(Figure 09.12-1\\). A **QS complex** may normally *still* be seen in **lead V2** *without* this necessarily meaning there has been prior septal infarction \\(*Section 09.10*\\). However, by **lead V3** — at least *some* r wave should be seen under normal circumstances. Regarding **T wave** appearance in lead V1 — the T should normally be *upright* by lead V2 in adults. Persistent T wave inversion in *anterior* leads should prompt consideration of ischemia. **NOTE:** The situation is *different* in children — for whom *anterior* T wave inversion up to lead V3 \\(*or even V4*\\) may reflect a **normal *juvenile* T wave pattern** \\(*Section 01.4*\\). \n+ **Leads III, aVL, aVF** \\(*as in* Figure 09.12-1\\) — may all *normally* show T wave inversion and/or an *isolated* Q wave that is *not* the result of ischemia or infarction — provided that these findings are not also seen in neighboring leads \\(*See Section 09.13*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.13 – FIGURE 09.13-1: *Inferior Infarction/Ischemia? ***\n\nTo illustrate the concept of normal *isolated* Q waves/T inversion — Consider the 6 limb lead sequence shown in **Figure 09.13-1**. *Which* leads manifest Q waves? Which lead\\(s\\) show T wave inversion of ST-T wave flattening?\n\n+ Is prior or recent ischemia/infarction likely in Figure 09.13-1? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.13-1:** There is an *isolated* Q wave *and* T wave inversion in lead III. There are also small q waves in leads I and aVL. *How* should this be interpreted? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.13-1:** The critical piece of information ***missing*** from the questions posed about the 6 limb leads shown in Figure 09.13-1 — is the **history**. Everything seen might *not* necessarily be abnormal — IF the patient was asymptomatic. On the other hand — IF this patient had a history of potentially *worrisome* chest discomfort, the findings in lead III would clearly be of concern. We emphasize the following:\n\n+ A **Q wave** is seen in **lead III** of Figure 09.13-1. Technically — this is a **QS complex**, since there is *no* R wave. Although this Q wave is not particularly deep \\(*it is only 2mm*\\) — given *lack* of any R wave, this Q wave \\(*QS complex*\\) portends the *same* clinical implications as would a larger or wider Q wave. That said — Q waves are *not* seen in the other 2 *inferior* leads \\(*leads II,aVF*\\). \n+ **Figure 09.12-1** tells us — that the finding of an *isolated* Q wave in lead III is *not* necessarily abnormal \\(*and is not necessarily indicative of prior infarction*\\). \n+ There is fairly** deep *symmetric* T wave inversion** in **lead III** \\(*especially in view of the small amplitude for the QRS complex in this lead*\\). IF this patient had *new-onset* chest discomfort — We would clearly be concerned about acute ischemia. That said — there is no more than *nonspecific* ST-T wave flattening in lead aVF and *no* real ST-T wave abnormality in the *other* inferior lead \\(= *lead II*\\). **Figure 09.12-1** tells us — that the finding of an *isolated* Q wave *and/or* T wave inversion in lead III \\(*as well as the nonspecific ST-T wave flattening seen in lead aVF*\\) is *not* necessarily ischemic IF there is no ST-T wave abnormality in lead II. \n+ **NOTE:** The T wave vector often follows fairly close behind the QRS vector. As a result — *isolated* T wave inversion in leads III, aVL or aVF is *less likely* to be ischemic IF the QRS complex is predominantly *negative* in the lead that manifests T wave inversion. This is the case for lead III in Figure 09.13-1. \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** We would note the following on our interpretation: *“Q wave with T inversion in lead III; nonspecific ST-T wave flattening in aVF; Suggest clinical correlation”*. All bets would be off IF this patient had *new-onset* chest discomfort — since absence of abnormality in lead II does *not* completely exclude the possibility of acute ischemia/infarction. But IF the patient was asymptomatic \\(*especially if a prior tracing was available and showed similar findings*\\) — We would strongly suspect that the ECG appearance in lead III was not indicative of ischemia/infarction. \n+ ***“Take-Home”* Point:** Most of the time when Q waves/T inversion reflects ischemia or infarction — *neighboring* leads \\(*in this case lead II as well as leads III,aVF*\\) will show *similar* changes. \n\n \n\n**What about the Q Waves in Leads I and aVL?**\n\nSmall narrow q waves are seen in leads I and aVL in Figure 09.13-1. This is a *descriptive* finding that we add to our interpretation at the time we assess for Q-R-S-T changes.\n\n+ These **q waves** in **leads I** and **aVL** of Fig. 09.13-1 are almost certainly **normal *septal* q waves** given their *small* size and occurrence in association with *no* ST-T wave abnormalities in these high lateral leads \\(*Section 09.12*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**09.14 – ST Elevation: *Shape/What is the Baseline?***\n\n\n\n**09.15 – ST Elevation or Depression: *What is the Baseline?***\n\nDetermining ST-T wave changes is essential to ECG interpretation. We favor use of the ***PR *segment baseline** as the reference point for judging ST segment deviations \\(*elevation *or* depression*\\). The **PR segment** is the ***connecting *line** that extends from the ***end*** of the P wave — *until* the ***beginning*** of the QRS complex \\(**Panel A*** in *Figure 09.15-1\\). With this reference point in mind — We define the following:\n\n+ **ST Elevation** \\(Panel B\\) — IF the ST segment arises from *above* the PR segment baseline. \n+ **ST Depression** \\(Panel C\\) — IF the ST segment arises from *below* the PR segment baseline. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.15-1:** Use of the PR segment baseline \\(**Panel A**\\) — to determine if there is ST elevation \\(**B**\\) or ST depression \\(**C**\\). Alternatively — *either* the T-P segment or some *combination* of PR and TP segments may be used as the baseline \\(*See text*\\). **Panel D** — shows the J-point *notching* that is characteristic of *early* repolarization \\(*Section 09.20*\\).\n\n***Clinical* Notes: **Given the importance of the ST segment baseline in determining ST-T wave deviations \\(*elevation or depression*\\) — it is important to appreciate the following caveat:\n\n+ The** PR segment baseline** — will be more difficult to see when the heart rate is faster. This is because the PR interval *shortens* with **tachycardia**. This makes it more challenging to determine a true “baseline” for the PR segment when the rate is fast. ***Other* situations** in which assessing the PR segment may be problematic include: **i\\)** when there is artifact;** ii\\)** if there is baseline wander; and **iii\\)** when there is PR depression \\(*as may occur with acute pericarditis; atrial infarction; and in some normal variants*\\). Knowing what to use as the baseline for ST segment deviations is sometimes no easy task. \n\n \n\n**An *Alternative* Baseline:** — Some clinicians favor using the **TP segment** as the baseline for judging ST segment deviations \\(**Panel A** *in* Fig. 09.15-1\\). We feel this is appropriate and a matter of personal preference.\n\n+ ***KEY* Point:** Far *more* important than whether one selects the TP vs PR segment as the baseline — is to **overview** the ***entire* tracing** to assess for baseline wander that may affect *whatever* baseline is selected. \n+ When conditions are ideal \\(ie, *no baseline wander; no PR depression; all complexes in a lead look identical*\\) — it is *easy* to pick out the baseline \\(*and it probably doesn’t matter whether you chose the TP or PR as your reference point*\\). \n+ ***Clinical* Reality:** Much of the time — the *optimal* situation of no baseline wander and perfect consistency from *one-beat-to-the-next* is simply *not* attainable. In such cases — We suggest surveying *all* 12 leads with goal to ***perceive*** a **“Gestalt”** \\(ie, *to get the best possible “feel” as to what seems to be the isoelectric baseline for the case at hand*\\). We’ll reinforce this concept through numerous clinical examples over remaining Sections in this ePub. \n\n \n\n**09.16 – J-Point ST Elevation: *Recognizing the J-Point***\n\nThe **J Point** “joins”. It ***joins*** the ***two *“S’s”** \\(ie, *the ****end**** of the QR****S ***— *with the ****beginning**** of the ****S****T segment *— *as shown in* **Panel D** *of* Figure 09.15-1\\). A distinct J point is *not* always seen \\(*since the QRS *and* the ST segment often imperceptibly blend into one another*\\).\n\n+ When it is seen — the **J point** is often ***slightly *elevated** \\(*with respect to the PR segment baseline*\\). This is often a ***normal *finding** — as will be discussed in detail in the sections on Early Repolarization \\(*Sections 09.20-through-09.23*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** The J point may be ***notched ***— especially when seen in association with *benign* repolarization variants \\(Panel A *vs ***Panel B*** in* **Figure 09.16-1**\\).\n\n+ In contrast — it is *uncommon* for *acute* MI to show J-point notching \\(*although you may occasionally see notching with acute pericarditis*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.16-1:** Comparison of a *normal* ST-T wave which shows *no* ST segment elevation \\(**Panel A**\\) — vs the typical J-point appearance \\(*red arrow*\\) of patients with normal repolarization variants \\(**Panel B**\\). As will be discussed under *Early* Repolarization \\(*Sections 09.20, 09.21*\\) — normal variants often manifest J-point notching and slight ST elevation. Note imperceptible *blending* of the normal ST segment and T wave in Panel A — as distinguished from the **J-point *notch*** in Panel B that marks the end of the QRS complex and beginning of the ST segment \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.17 – SHAPE of ST Elevation: *More Important than Amount\\!***\n\nA *KEY* principle to appreciate — is that the ***shape*** of **ST elevation** is *more* important than the *amount* of elevation \\(**Figure 09.17-1**\\). For example — *acute* MI may occasionally occur with *no more* than *minimal* ST elevation. There are *other* times — when ST elevation may be much more marked, yet *not* be due to an acute cardiac event. ***Bottom* Line:** Appreciation of **ST segment *shape*** — in context with the clinical situation is essential for accurate interpretation.\n\n+ ST elevation with an *upward* concavity \\(ie, ***\"smiley\"*** *configuration*\\) is usually benign — especially when seen in an otherwise healthy, *asymptomatic* individual \\(*and especially when seen with ****notching**** of the ***J point*** in one or more leads*\\). This ECG picture represents the benign *normal* variant pattern known as ***early* repolarization** \\(Figure 09.17-1\\). \n+ In contrast — ST segment elevation with ***coving*** or a *downward *convexity \\(= ***\"frowny\"*** configuration\\) — is much more likely to be due to acute injury \\(*from ischemia/infarction*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.17-1:** *Shape* of ST elevation is *more* important than amount. *Upward* concavity \\(***“smiley”-****shape*\\) ST elevation is more likely to reflect the *benign* normal variant of ***early* repolarization** \\(*especially if seen with J-point notching*\\). In contrast — **coved** \\(= *convex down or ****“frowny”****-shape*\\) ST elevation is more likely to indicate ischemia/infarction \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.18 – HISTORY: *Importance of Clinical Correlation***\n\nHistory is *ever* important in assessing the clinical significance of ST elevation. Although ST elevation with upward concavity \\(= ***\"smiley\"*** *configuration*\\) and J point ***notching*** will most often reflect a normal *repolarization* variant — this is *only* true IF the patient is *asymptomatic.*\n\n+ In contrast — An *identical “smiley-shape”* ST pattern obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest discomfort *must* be assumed acute until *proven* otherwise. IF ever in doubt — *Admit the patient* to the hospital\\! Look for *old* tracings to compare. *Repeat* the ECG within a *short* period of time. *Don’t move on* to your next assignment until you are comfortable that an acute ischemic process is *not* evolving. \n+ **NOTE:** There is an *uncommon* form of repolarization variant that manifests an ST segment coving \\(*“frowny”*\\) morphology. The clue that this otherwise worrisome pattern is likely to be benign lies in the **History:** The patient is usually a young, healthy athlete \\(*often African-American*\\) — who is asymptomatic \\(*See* Figure 09.24-1 *in Section 09.24*\\). Having a prior tracing for comparison may be invaluable. *Without* a prior tracing — it might be *impossible* to distinguish this pattern from *acute* MI if the patient presented to the ED with chest discomfort. ***Bottom* Line:** The ***History**** is ever important\\!* \n\n \n\n**09.19 – FIGURE 09.19-1: *Early Repolarization *or* Acute MI?***\n\nTo solidify the concepts covered thus far — We present the 12-lead ECG shown in **Figure 09.19-1**. There is definite ST segment elevation in a number of leads. How would you interpret this ECG in the context given for each of the 3 following *clinical* settings?\n\n+ ***Scenario* \\#1:** — IF the patient was an ***asymptomatic*** young adult? \n+ ***Scenario* \\#2:** — IF the patient was a *young-to-middle-aged* adult with *recent* URI and ***pleuritic*** chest pain? \n+ ***Scenario* \\#3:** — IF the patient was an *older *adult with severe ***new-onset* chest pain?** \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** The ***Descriptive* Analysis** for ECG findings on this 12-lead tracing does *not* change. Only the ***Clinical* Impression** changes — depending on which of the above 3 clinical settings is operative.\n\n\n\n**Figure 09.19-1:** Sinus rhythm with ST elevation in a number of leads. *What* is the likely cause of ST elevation? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Descriptive* ANALYSIS:** The rhythm in Figure 09.19-1 — is sinus at ~60/minute. The PR, QRS, and QT intervals are normal. We estimate the axis at \\+60 degrees. The sum of the S wave in lead V2 \\(*~3 large boxes = 15 mm*\\) plus the R wave in V5 or V6 \\(*~5 large boxes = 25 mm*\\) clearly *exceeds* 35. This amplitude amount satisfies ***voltage* criteria** for **LVH** — provided the patient is *at least* 35 years old \\(*Section 08.1*\\).\n\n+ **QRST Changes** — A **Q wave** and **T wave inversion** is seen in **lead III** — which as *isolated* findings may be normal \\(*Section 09.12*\\). There are small *septal* q waves in V5,V6. Transition is normal \\(*the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep between lead V2-to-V4*\\). \n+ The most remarkable finding is **ST elevation** in ***multiple* leads**. ST segments manifest an *upward* concavity \\(ie, ***”smiley”*** *configuration*\\). As seen in the *blow-up* of leads V5,V6 \\(**Figure 09.19-2**\\) — there is ***notching ***of the **J-point** \\(*arrow in lead V5*\\). The combination of *upward concavity* ST elevation in association with J-point *notching* — looks very much like the ***“smiley”-****shape* ST segment appearance of ***early *repolarization** previously seen in *schematic* Figure 09.17-1. \n+ Remarkably *absent* from the ECG in Figure 09.19-1 — is *reciprocal* ST depression that would be expected if infarction was acutely evolving. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.19-2:** *Blow-up* of leads V5,V6 from Figure 09.19-1. The *upward* concavity \\(*“****smiley****”-shape*\\) ST segment in association with ***J-point* notching** \\(*arrow*\\) is characteristic of **ERP** \\(***E****arly ****R****epolarization ****P****attern*\\). *Diffuseness* of this ST elevation on the 12-lead \\(Fig. 09.19-1\\) — *lack* of significant Q waves and *absence* of *reciprocal* ST depression *all* support ERP as the diagnosis.\n\n***Clinical* IMPRESSION:** The most important point to emphasize about this ECG — is that ***our* interpretation** of **Figure 09.19-3** will vary tremendously depending on history and the *clinical* setting. ***Descriptive* Analysis** *stays the same*. However, what we would do clinically will be *very* different:\n\n***Scenario* \\#1:** — IF the patient is an ***asymptomatic* 25-year old adult**:\n\n+ Voltage criteria for LVH would *not* be satisfied in Figure 09.19-3 \\(*since the patient is less than 35 years old*\\). \n+ We would interpret the ST elevation seen in multiple leads of this tracing as most consistent with **ERP** \\(***E****arly ****R****epolarization ****P****attern*\\) — since this young, *asymptomatic* adult manifests benign-appearing *concave up* ST elevation with: **i\\)** J-point point *notching* in at least several of the leads with ST elevation; **ii\\)** *Lack* of significant Q waves; and **iii\\)** An* absence* of *reciprocal* ST depression. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.19-3:** We reproduce Figure 09.19-1. The likely significance of the diffuse ST elevation seen depends on the clinical setting \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Scenario* \\#2:** — IF the patient whose ECG is shown in Figure 09.19-3 was a *young-to-middle-aged* adult with history of *recent* URI \\(*Upper Respiratory Infection*\\) and ***pleuritic* chest pain**:\n\n+ We would actively *consider* the possibility of ***acute* pericarditis** — because: **i\\)** ST elevation is seen in *multiple* leads \\(*I,II,III,aVF; V2-through-V6*\\); **ii\\)** Infarction Q waves are *not* seen; and **iii\\)** *Reciprocal* ST depression is absent \\(*ECG findings of acute pericarditis are discussed in detail in Section 12.2*\\). \n\n \n\n***Scenario* \\#3:** — IF the patient was *older* with severe ***new-onset* chest pain**:\n\n+ Voltage criteria for LVH now *would* be satisfied. \n+ We would definitely contemplate the ***possibility*** of ***acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\) — since there is *unmistakable* ST elevation in this patient presenting with *new-onset* chest pain. \n+ **2-Things-To-Do** — to assist in evaluation would be: **i\\) *Repeat*** the **ECG** in a little while \\(*to see if there are any evolutionary changes*\\); and **ii\\)** Look for a ***prior* ECG** — so that you can determine IF the patient has early repolarization as a baseline finding. \n+ We emphasize that several ECG features in Figure 09.19-3 are ***against*** this being an ***acute* STEMI**. These include: **i\\)** How *diffuse* the ST elevation is; **ii\\)** *upward* concavity shape with J-point notching; **iii\\)** the q waves seen are small and narrow; and **iv\\)** general *lack* of reciprocal ST depression. That said — **the *onus* of proof *is on* us** — and, there is a Q wave with T inversion in lead III — the ST segment takeoff in lead V3 is *straighter* than is usually seen with early repolarization — and patients with *baseline* ERP can develop *superimposed* acute infarction \\(*so the patient might have had a component of early repolarization prior to developing their acute infarction*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** We *need* to know the *clinical* setting in order to be able to interpret the ECG in Figure 09.19-3. Descriptive analysis will *stay the same* regardless of the history — but clinical interpretation will be vastly *different* depending on what the history is.\n\n***Beyond-the-Core:*** Did you notice the **S1-Q3-T3 pattern** in Figure 09.19-3? It turns out that this ECG *was* obtained from a healthy, *asymptomatic* young adult and that the ST elevation was entirely due to ***early* repolarization**.\n\n+ As emphasized in Section 08.36 — the *isolated* finding of an **S1-Q3-T3** pattern in an otherwise healthy individual may be normal. An S1-Q3-T3 is *only* helpful in the diagnosis of *acute* PE \\(*Pulmonary Embolus*\\) — IF the history is *“right”* and there are *other* suggestive ECG findings. \n\n \n\n**09.20 – What is* EARLY* REPOLARIZATION?**\n\nHaving discussed the elements required for determining whether there is ST elevation — with emphasis on the importance of assessing ST segment *shape* plus the *clinical* history — we now explore further the entity known as **ERP** \\(***E****arly ****R****epolarization ****P****attern*\\).\n\n+ The term **ERP** — relates to a common ECG finding characterized by **J-point abnormalities** and *associated* **ST-T wave changes**. These features are shown in **Figure 09.20-1**: \n+ Typically — there is J-point ST elevation with *upward* concavity \\(**Panel A**\\). \n+ There may be frank **notching** — defined as an upward deflection near the end of the R wave downslope \\(**Panel B**\\). \n+ Alternatively — there may be **slurring** \\(*without notching*\\) of the terminal portion of R wave downslope as it transitions into the ST segment \\(**Panel C**\\). Note that there is no more than minimal ST elevation in association with such slurring in Panel C. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.20-1:** ECG features of ***early* repolarization**. There is *concave up* ST elevation *\\(“smiley”-shape*\\) in at least *several* leads — often with *either* J-point notching *and/or* terminal R wave slurring in one or more of the leads that manifest ST elevation \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.21 –* Early* Repolarization: *Variations in the Definition***\n\nFirst described in the 1940’s — there are ***variations*** in **how** even the **experts *define* “ERP”**. Many imply that the entity is defined by J-point ST elevation of *characteristic* shape. Others include J-point abnormalities \\(*notching, slurring*\\) — even when there is no more than *minimal* associated ST segment elevation.\n\n+ Typically — there is at least **1-2 mm** of ***upward* concavity** \\(“*smiley”-shape*\\)** ST segment elevation** with prominent ***upright* T waves** in *at least* **2 *contiguous* leads**. \n+ Some include *anterior* lead ST elevation within their definition of “ERP”. Others maintain that ***some* degree** \\(*1-2mm*\\) of ***anterior* ST elevation** \\(*in V2-to-V4*\\) is so common as to be a ***normal* finding** \\(*and not indicative of ERP*\\). \n+ The presence of 1-2mm *upward* concavity **ST elevation** in *either* **inferior** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) or **lateral** \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\) **lead areas** is much ***less* common** than *anterior* ST elevation – and – *clearly* satisfies criteria for “ERP”. \n+ *More than one lead area may be involved* with ERP. Occasionally there may even be *“global”* ST elevation \\(*in inferior, lateral, and anterior leads*\\) — which may understandably be *difficult to distinguish* from *acute* pericarditis. \n+ **ECG *changes*** of **ERP** may be ***dynamic***. They may come or go with *change* in body position \\(*from supine to standing*\\) — with activity \\(*they commonly disappear during exercise testing*\\) — and ERP may change over time \\(*especially if the patient becomes deconditioned or during illness*\\). **CAVEAT:** *Such* ST-T wave changes do *not* necessarily indicate ischemia or *acute* infarction\\! \n+ ***Other* Patterns** of ***“repolarization variants”* exist**. These include *anterior* T wave peaking \\(Figure 09.23-1\\) — and ST segment coving \\(Fig 09.24-1\\). \n\n \n\n**09.22 – ERP: *Is Early Repolarization Benign?***\n\nIn years past — the *incidental* finding of *upward concavity* ST elevation in an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic *young-to-middle-aged* adult was thought to be benign. As a result — the name of this entity evolved to the term, **“BER”** = ***B****enign ****E****arly ****R****epolarization*. While fully agreeing on the overall favorable prognosis for the overwhelming majority of patients with this type of ST elevation — We feel **“ERP”** \\(***E****arly ****R****epolarization ****P****attern*\\) is a **far *better* term** than “BER” because:\n\n+ The *incidental* ECG finding of ***early* repolarization** in *young-to-middle-aged* asymptomatic adults is ***not necessarily* benign**. Tikkanen et al \\(*NEJM 361:2529, 2009*\\) — have shown a 1.3-fold *increased* risk of cardiac death with ≥1mm early repolarization ST elevation \\(*and up to a 3-fold increased risk IF \u003e2mm ST elevation*\\). ***What to do with these results?*** \n\n \n\n**The Facts about ERP are the following:**\n\n+ Early repolarization is common. It is seen in *at least* 2-5% of the general population. Cardiac arrest is *rare* in these patients. *Most patients *with* incidental *ERP on ECG have a* benign *prognosis. \n+ IF the patient is otherwise healthy and asymptomatic — We choose *not* to be concerned by the *incidental* finding of early repolarization on a baseline tracing. \n+ There is general consensus that the *isolated* finding of *anterior* ST elevation conveys *no* increase in cardiovascular risk. This form of ERP* is *benign. \n+ *Final* answers are *not yet* “in” for *inferior* or *lateral* ERP. **Consider *further* evaluation** IF: **i\\)** there is a *positive* family history of *sudden* death at *early* age; **ii\\)** the patient had *unexplained* syncope/presyncope; *and*/*or* **iii\\)** there are *other* symptoms, arrhythmias or concerns. \n\n \n\n**09.23 – FIGURE 09.23-1: *Acute MI or Repolarization Variant?***\n\nIllustration of how best to interpret ECG findings suggestive of ERP is best accomplished by clinical example. Consider the ECG shown in **Figure 09.23-1** — which was obtained from a 50-year old man with *atypical* chest discomfort.\n\n+ Is this ECG likely to reflect ERP or acute *anterior* MI? \n+ How *confident* are you of your answer? \n+ Are you *comfortable enough* to send this patient home IF he presented to an ED \\(*Emergency Department*\\) with this tracing? \n+ Would you send the patient home IF he presented to the office with this ECG and the *same* history of *atypical* chest discomfort? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.23-1:** ECG obtained from a 50-year old man with *atypical* chest discomfort. Is the ST elevation seen in leads V1,V2 likely to represent an *early* acute *anterior* STEMI? How *confident* are you of your answer? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.23-1:** Descriptive analysis of this ECG reveals the rhythm to be sinus arrhythmia. Intervals and the axis are normal. There is *voltage* for LVH \\(*deepest S wave in V1,V2 \\+ tallest R wave in V5,V6 ≥35*\\).\n\n+ **QRST Changes** — There are small q waves in the inferior and lateral precordial leads. R wave progression is normal \\(ie, *transition occurs between leads V3-to-V4*\\). **T waves** are ***peaked***. There is some **J-point ST elevation** \\(*with upward concavity = “smiley” configuration*\\) in multiple leads — and there is **shallow *symmetric* T wave inversion** in** lead aVL** \\(*red arrow*\\). \n\n \n\n**IMPRESSION** — Accurate clinical interpretation of this tracing depends on the history. Without any history — We would *not* know clinically how to proceed.\n\n+ **IF *concerned*** that the history of *“atypical chest discomfort”* in this 50-year old man sounded like angina \\(*especially if his symptoms were of new-onset*\\) — the patient should be *admitted* to the hospital\\! There is ***precordial* lead ST elevation**. We would: **i\\)** Look for a ***prior* tracing** for comparison \\(*to see if there was change from his baseline ECG*\\); and **ii\\) *Repeat*** the **ECG** in short order — to see if there is acute evolution. \n+ That said — We **strongly *suspect* ERP** as the cause of ST elevation in Figure 09.23-1 because: **i\\)** ST elevation manifests an *upward* concavity = *“smiley”* configuration; and **ii\\)** The *lack* of reciprocal ST depression. Although there is shallow T wave inversion in lead aVL — this is probably a normal finding given predominant negativity of the QRS complex in this lead and lack of associated T inversion in other lateral leads \\(*Section 09.12*\\). \n+ ***Beyond-the-Core:*** Several *additional* ECG features in Figure 09.23-1 are present that ***favor* ERP** \\(*rather than acute infarction*\\). These include the following: **i\\)** that precordial lead QRS amplitude is increased \\(*increased R wave amplitude in V1-through-V4 is less likely when there is anterior infarction*\\); **ii\\)** that the R wave is *already* fairly tall by V2,V3 \\(*delayed transition is commonly seen with anterior infarction*\\); and **iii\\)** that the QT is definitely *not* long \\(*acute ischemia/infarction commonly results in at least some lengthening of the QT interval*\\). That said — the ***clinical* history** — a ***repeat* ECG** and availability of ***prior* ECGs** for ***comparison*** will ultimately dictate the course. \n+ **NOTE:** *Where* the patient presents for evaluation *does* have a role in determining the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital. Given *identical* clinical features and a *similar* ECG — the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital appears to be *more* IF the patient is seen in an ED \\(*Emergency Department*\\). This is because: **i\\)** Emergency care providers are less likely to know the patient and the previous medical history \\(*and also less likely to have a prior ECG available for comparison*\\); and **ii\\)** There appears to be a *tendency* toward ***self-selection***, whereby patients with more acute cardiac disorders *somehow* know to go to the ED rather than the office. That said — ***the onus remains on us*** to assume the worst scenario \\(ie, *ACS = Acute Coronary Syndrome*\\) until we can be comfortable that it is safe to send the patient home. ***BOTTOM* Line:** The clinical history is needed in order to know what to do for a patient presenting with the ECG shown in Figure 09.23-1. While a diagnosis of ERP *without* need for admission would be reasonable IF the history was *not* of concern — a very *different* conclusion would be reached IF symptoms sounded acute. \n\n \n\n**T Wave Peaking:** The final point to make from the ECG in Figure 09.23-1 — is that ***repolarization* variants** that occur in otherwise healthy adults may take on a number of different forms. These include: **i\\)** Upward concavity \\(*“smiley”-shape*\\) ST elevation \\(*Sections 09.20 and 09.21*\\); **ii\\) T wave peaking** \\(Figure 09.23-1\\); and **iii\\)** *Other* patterns \\(*See Section 09.24*\\).\n\n+ The ECG finding of ***peaked* T waves** should prompt consideration of **3 entities**. These include: **i\\)** Hyperkalemia; **ii\\)** Ischemia; and **iii\\)** A **normal *repolarization* variant**. Morphologic appearance, clinical correlation and comparison with *prior* tracings may be needed to distinguish between these possibilities. \n+ *Against* hyperkalemia in Figure 09.23-1 — is that T waves are *not* pointed; the ascending and descending limbs of the T waves are *not* symmetric; and the base of the T waves is *not* narrow \\(*Section 11.3*\\). Patients with hyperkalemia almost always have either a *predisposing* medical illness \\(*severe renal disease; acidosis; dehydration; multi-organ failure*\\) or are taking *potassium-retaining* medications. \n+ ***Posterior* ischemia** — may manifest as *anterior* T wave peaking. That said, ischemia is highly *unlikely* — IF T wave peaking is diffuse and the patient is a younger adult who is *not* having chest pain \\(*as occurs in this case*\\). \n+ **T wave peaking** \\(*as seen in *Figure 09.23-1\\) — is a *descriptive* finding. We presume it is due to a **benign *repolarization* variant** *only after* we are comfortable that it is *not* due to hyperkalemia or ischemia. \n\n \n\n**09.24 – FIGURE 09.24-1: *Acute MI or Repolarization Variant?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown in **Figure 09.24-1**. *No history is given*.\n\n+ Is this ECG likely to reflect ACS \\(*Acute Coronary Syndrome*\\) with possible recent infarction? \n+ Can you think of a clinical scenario whereby the ECG shown in Figure 09.24-1 might be a *normal* variant? \n+ *Extra Credit:* Is there LVH? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.24-1:** No clinical history is given. Has there been *recent* infarction \\(*or ongoing acute ischemia*\\)? Does this patient have LVH? What information is needed to answer these questions? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.24-1:** Descriptive analysis of this ECG reveals the rhythm to be sinus arrhythmia. Intervals are normal. There is ***marked* LAD** \\(*Left Axis Deviation*\\) that satisfies criteria for **LAHB** \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\) — as the *net* QRS deflection in lead II is predominantly negative \\(*Section 07.13*\\).\n\n+ ***Chamber* Enlargement** — Did you notice there is ***half* standardization**? The standardization mark is seen at the very beginning of the tracing — and is only 1 *large* box \\(*5mm*\\) tall \\(*red rectangle in lead II of* **Figure 09.24-2**\\). This means that amplitude of the P wave and QRST complex has been reduced in half in order to fit on the ECG recording paper \\(*Section 08.5*\\). Therefore — **S wave** depth in **lead V2** is *not* 12 mm, but **24 mm** — and **R wave** amplitude in **lead V5** is *not* 10 mm, but **20 mm**\\! Therefore — ***voltage* criteria** for **LVH** will be satisfied IF the patient is 35 years old. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.24-2:** The ECG shown in Figure 09.24-1 is reproduced — highlighting that there is ***half* standardization** \\(*red rectangle in lead II; open arrows at the very beginning of leads I and III*\\). As a result — ***voltage*** for **LVH** is present IF this patient is 35 years old. Are you concerned about the **ST-T waves** in the *inferior* leads and especially in leads V3-through-V6 \\(*red arrows*\\)?\n\n**Assessment of QRST Changes:** No Q waves are present in Figure 09.24-2 — as *small-but-real* initial r waves are seen in each of the inferior leads. Transition occurs early due to a surprisingly tall R wave in lead V2. That said — the most concerning finding on this ECG is **ST coving** with ***slight* ST elevation** and **T wave inversion** in *multiple* leads \\(*red arrows in precordial leads*\\).\n\n+ IF this patient was older with a history of *new* chest pain — this ECG would look like an *acute* evolving MI. It turned out that the patient in this case was a young adult athlete with *no* heart disease who had this ECG done as part of a pre-participation sports exam. Thus, the ST-T wave changes seen are most likely to represent an *unusual* ***repolarization* variant**. In view of this benign clinical setting — there is no evidence for acute ischemia. ***Bottom *Line:** Be aware that there are a number of different repolarization variants that may be seen on the ECG of *normal* subjects. ***History is everything\\!*** \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* If we were evaluating this asymptomatic young adult athlete in the office as part of a *pre-participation* exam — We would recommend an **Echo** to *rule out* hypertrophic cardiomyopathy given early transition with prominent septal forces \\(ie, *disproportionately tall R waves in leads V2,V3*\\). If physical examination and the Echo were normal — there would be no reason not to allow full participation. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**09.25 – ST Segment Depression**\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Section 09.15 — We favor use of the ***PR *segment baseline** as the reference point for judging ST segment deviations \\(*elevation *or* depression*\\). The **PR segment** is the ***connecting *line** that extends from the ***end*** of the P wave — *until* the ***beginning*** of the QRS complex \\(**Panel A*** in *Figure 09.25-1\\). Using the PR baseline as our reference point — We define the following:\n\n+ **ST Elevation** \\(Panel B\\) — IF the ST segment arises *above* the PR baseline. \n+ **ST Depression** \\(Panel C\\) — IF the ST segment arises *below* the PR baseline. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.25-1:** Use of the PR segment baseline \\(**Panel A**\\) — to determine if there is ST elevation \\(**B**\\) or ST depression \\(**C**\\). Alternatively — *either* the T-P segment or some *combination* of PR and TP segments may be used as the baseline \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Clinical* Caveats: **The** PR segment baseline** is more difficult to see when the heart rate is faster. This is because the PR interval *shortens* with tachycardia. This makes it more challenging to determine a true “baseline” for the PR segment when the rate is fast.\n\n+ *Other* situations in which assessing the PR segment may be problematic include presence of artifact and baseline wander. Knowing what to use as the baseline for ST segment deviations is sometimes no easy task. \n+ **NOTE:** Instead of the PR segment — some clinicians favor the **TP segment** as the baseline to use for judging ST segment deviations \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 09.25-1\\). *Either* approach is acceptable — and, when conditions are ideal \\(ie, *no artifact; no baseline wander; all complexes in a lead look identical*\\) — determining the baseline is easy \\(*and it doesn’t really matter whether you select the TP, PR, or some combination of the two as your reference point*\\). \n\n \n\n**09.26 – LIST \\#4: *Causes of ST Depression***\n\nThere are ***over* 50 causes** of ST segment depression on ECG. Many of these causes are *cardiac-related* — but there are also many *non-cardiac* causes. Among the many ***non-cardiac* causes** are hyperventilation; temperature extremes \\(*excessive heat or cold exposure*\\); anxiety or emotional stress; anemia; tachycardia; sleep deprivation; pulmonary disease; electrolyte abnormalities; central nervous system disorders; certain medications; and severe medical illness \\(*among others*\\). ***BOTTOM* Line:** Rather than commit to memory an *exhaustive* list of conditions predisposing to ST segment depression — it suffices to appreciate the variety of entities that may produce changes on ECG. **Remember:** *Many of these conditions are non-cardiac*.\n\n+ We *simplify* recall of those clinical entities predisposing to ST depression that we feel are *most* important to remember with our **LIST \\#4** in** Figure 09.26-1**. \n+ In general — ***causes*** of **T wave abnormalities** \\(*including T wave flattening or frank T wave inversion*\\) are *similar* to potential causes of ST segment depression. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.26-1:** *Common* Causes of ST Depression = **LIST \\#4**. A similar list may produce T wave changes. *More* than a single cause may be operative in a given patient.\n\n**09.27 – ST-T Wave Appearance: *A Hint to the Cause***\n\nAlthough *all* **6** of the **possibilities** noted in **List \\#4** should be considered *each* time you encounter ST-T wave abnormalities — the *specific* cause\\(s\\) operative may be suggested by ***appearance*** of the **ST-T wave** on ECG \\(**Figure 09.27-1**\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 09.27-1:** ST-T wave *appearance* may suggest the cause\\(s\\) operative in a given patient \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Shape*** of the **ST-T wave** — may suggest which of the 6 entities in **List \\#4** is likely to be operative in a given patient \\(Figure 09.27-1\\):\n\n+ **Ischemia** — is suggested by ***symmetric* T inversion** \\(*red arrow in ***Panel B**\\) — especially when seen in two or more leads of a given lead group \\(ie, *in leads II, III *and* aVF *— *or in both leads I and aVL*\\). \n+ In contrast — **\"Strain\" **from LVH** \\(Panel A\\)** is suggested by ***asymmetric* ST depression** occurring in one \\(*or more*\\) of the ***lateral* leads** \\(*less often in the inferior leads*\\). Note the initial *slow* sagging of the ST segment with “strain” \\(*black arrow*\\) — with more rapid return to the baseline \\(*Section 08.9*\\). “Strain” is more likely to be the cause of ST depression when voltage for LVH is present — although occasionally, there may be ST-T wave changes suggestive of “strain” *without* accompanying voltage \\(*Section 08.10*\\). \n+ **\"RV strain\"** — is suggested IF the picture in **Panel A** of Fig. 09.27-1 is seen in ***right-sided *leads** \\(*II,III,aVF *or* V1,V2,V3*\\) in a patient with **RVH** \\(*Sections 08.28 and 08.29*\\). \n+ Use of **Digoxin** may ***affect* ST-T waves** in one of **3** ways: **i\\)** there may be ***“scooped”* ST depression** in multiple leads \\(*that simulates an inverted ice cream cone, as in ***Panel D*** of *Figure 09.27-1\\); or **ii\\)** Digoxin “effect” may produce a ***\"strain\"-like *pattern** \\(*identical to* **Panel A**\\); or **iii\\)** Despite use of Digoxin — ST-T waves may be unaffected. It is of interest that the serum Digoxin level does *not* correlate well with ST-T wave appearance in a patient taking this drug. Thus, a patient may manifest classic “scoopies” \\(*scooped ST depression with a short QT interval in multiple leads*\\) — yet be on no more than a *low* dose of the drug. In contrast, another patient may have toxic serum levels of Digoxin — yet manifest *no* ST-T wave abnormalities at all. ***Bottom* Line:** ST-T wave appearance does *not* predict which patients have Digoxin toxicity. \n+ **Panel C** — is the remaining pattern of ST-T wave change in Figure 09.27-1. We label this pattern as, **“NS ST-T Abns.”** \\(= ***N****on-****S****pecific ****ST-T ****wave ****A****bnormalities*\\) — since such ST flattening *and/or* slight depression does *not* suggest any *specific* cause. Instead — *any* of the *more* than 50 potential causes of ST-T wave abnormalities may be contributing to the appearance of this pattern. ***Bottom* Line:** The ST-T wave is *not* normal — but the change that we see is ***non-specific*** in that we *don’t* know the cause. \n\n \n\n**09.28 – FIGURE 09.28-1: *What is the Cause\\(s\\) of ST Depression?***\n\nIt is easiest to illustrate the concepts covered in Sections 09.26 and 09.27 by a clinical case. Interpret the ECG shown in **Figure 09.28-1** — obtained from a woman on *multiple* medications. She has chest pain and heart failure. Note the *marked* amount of **ST depression** in ***multiple* leads** — which is especially well seen in the blow-up inserts from leads V5,V6 \\(*red arrows*\\).\n\n+ In view of this clinical history — What are likely causes of this marked amount of ST depression? \n+ **HINT:** Feel free to refer back to **LIST \\#4** in formulating your answer \\(Figure 09.26-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.28-1:** ECG obtained from a woman with chest pain and heart failure. She is taking *multiple* medications. What are *likely* causes of the *marked* ST depression seen in *multiple* leads? \\(*Feel free to refer back to* **List \\#4** *in* Figure 09.26-1 *when formulating your answer*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.28-1:** The rhythm is an almost ***regular* SVT** \\(*narrow complex tachycardia*\\) at ~180/minute. Given the rate and the lack of any definite P waves — we presume **PSVT** for the rhythm diagnosis \\(List \\#2 — *in Section 02.52*\\). The axis is normal; there is voltage for LVH.\n\n+ The most remarkable finding on this 12-lead ECG is marked and ***diffuse *ST depression**. ST segments are depressed *at least* 3mm below the J-point baseline in *multiple* leads \\(*seen especially well in the blow-up inserts of leads V5,V6 — red arrows in *Fig. 09.28-1\\). \n+ Recognition of the ECG finding of **ST depression** should prompt consideration of the clinical entities noted in **List \\#4** \\(*in* Figure 09.26-1\\). \n+ The ***clinical *History** allows us to hone in on the likely causes of ST depression. In this case — any \\(*probably several*\\) of the entities in **List \\#4** may be operative, since this patient has chest pain \\(*possible ischemia*\\) — she has heart failure and LVH \\(*LV “strain” is probably present*\\) — she is on lots of drugs \\(*possibly digoxin; probably diuretics predisposing to low K\\+/Mg\\+\\+*\\) — and she is tachycardic \\(*SVT rhythm at ~180/minute*\\). \n\n \n\n***“Take-Home” *Point:** The ECG in Figure 09.28-1 provides an excellent example of how best to utilize **List \\#4**. We interpret the 12-lead tracing in the usual systematic fashion. Recognition of ***diffuse* ST depression** should set off the “light bulb” to recall the entities on List \\#4. Clinical correlation with the history given allows us to predict a likely contribution from each of the entities on the list.\n\n**09.29 – Recognizing *Subtle* ST Changes: *ST Segment Straightening***\n\nConsensus among expert electrocardiographers is lacking regarding the definition of a “normal” ECG. Much of this relates to semantics — since *minor* ST-T wave abnormalities generally provide no more than a *nonspecific* suggestion to potential etiologies. That said — We feel it is important to ***hone in*** on recognizing even *minimal* abnormalities, if for no other reason than to let those reading our interpretation be aware that *we saw the abnormality* in question but did *not* think it clinically important for the case at hand.\n\n+ The above said — there *are* times when even *minimal* ST-T wave changes may have clinical relevance. In addition — *routine* attention to **recognizing *subtle* ST-T wave changes** will go a *long* way toward improving one’s ECG interpretation ability. \n+ For example — *What is the difference* between the ST segment shown in **Panel A** *vs* **Panel B** in Figure 09.29-1? Is the admittedly *subtle* difference in ST-T wave appearance between these two complexes likely to be of clinical significance? If so — *How?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.29-1:** Compare the ST segment in **Panel A** with **Panel B**. *What is the difference?* Is this likely to be clinically significant? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.29-1:** The **ST-T wave** in **Panel A** is ***normal***. Note the *smooth* contour at the point of transition between the end of the S wave and the beginning of the ST segment. Note an equally *smooth* contour at the end of the ST segment and the point where the ascending limb of the T wave begins.\n\n+ In contrast — Note the ***sharp* angle** in **Panel B** at the point where the straight \\(*flat*\\) ST segment ends and the ascending limb of the T wave begins \\(*red arrow*\\). While admittedly “splitting hairs” — the ST-T wave in Panel B is *not* normal. Instead — there is ***nonspecific* ST segment straightening** \\(ie, *loss of that smooth transition between end of the ST segment *and* the beginning of the T wave ascending limb*\\). \n+ We emphasize that *“nonspecific ST segment straightening”* — is a ***descriptive* finding**. It is *nonspecific*. It may mean nothing — especially if only seen in a single lead. In any case — it is *not* an acute change. On the other hand — ST segment *straightening* as occurs in **Panel B** may at times be a *nonspecific* indicator of underlying coronary disease — especially when this finding is seen in more than one lead. *Clinical correlation is everything*. \n\n \n\n**09.30 – FIGURE 09.30-1: *Are the ST Segments Normal?***\n\nInterpret the ECG shown in Figure 09.30-1 — obtained from an adult with a recent history of *atypical* chest discomfort.\n\n+ Would you classify the ECG shown in **Figure 09.30-1** as a “normal” tracing? \n+ If not — *Why not?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.30-1:** ECG obtained from an adult with *atypical* chest discomfort. Would you interpret this ECG as a “normal” tracing?\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.30-1:** The rhythm is sinus bradycardia and arrhythmia \\(*heart rate ~60/minute, or a bit below this*\\). The PR, QRS and QT intervals are all normal — as is the axis \\(*which is about \\+30 degrees*\\). There is no chamber enlargement.\n\n+ **Q-R-S-T Changes**: A small and narrow q wave is seen in lead aVL. Transition is slightly delayed \\(*the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep between V4-to-V5*\\). The most remarkable finding on this ECG is **ST segment *flattening*** with ***slight* ST depression** in ***multiple* leads**. \n+ The *amount* of actual ST segment depression on this tracing is minimal \\(*no more than 1mm in the inferior leads*\\) — yet there is *no* denying that ST depression is present \\(*See blow-up inserts in the inferior leads in* **Figure 09.30-2**\\). \n+ There is *no* ST depression at all in leads I and V2-through-V6 \\(Figure 09.30-2\\). That said — ST-T waves are *not* normal in these leads. Instead — there is *subtle-but-real* **ST segment *straightening*** that resembles the picture in **Panel B** of Figure 09.29-1. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** The ECG in **Figure 09.30-2** is *not* normal. Instead — there is diffuse ***nonspecific* ST flattening** and ***slight* ST depression**. *These changes are subtle but real*. Clinical correlation is essential for knowing how to interpret this ECG finding. This patient may have coronary disease — possibly even *severe* coronary disease. On the other hand — these changes are *not* acute and they could be due in part or in combination to *any* of the *other* potential causes of ST depression \\(*drug effect, electrolyte disorder, hyperventilation, acutely ill patient, etc.*\\). We simply *cannot* tell on the basis of this single ECG.\n\n\n\n**Figure 09.30-2:** Reproduction of the ECG in Figure 09.30-1, with *blow-up* inserts illustrating *subtle* ST-T wave abnormalities. Note that there is ST depression \\(*of ~1mm*\\) in the inferior leads. There is also ST segment flattening \\(*straightening*\\) but *no* depression in leads I and V2-through-V6 \\(*red arrows in blow-up inserts in V5,V6*\\). Although T wave amplitude in lead aVL is reduced — note that gradual transition from ST segment-to-T-wave is preserved in this lead \\(*blue arrow*\\) — compared to clear *straightening* of the ST segment in leads V5,V6 \\(*red arrows*\\). This is *not* a “normal” ECG \\(*See text*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**09.31 – *Clinical *Uses of Lead aVR**\n\n\n\nIn years past — We virtually *ignored* **lead aVR**. *No longer\\!* This once forgotten *right-sided* lead is now appreciated for a series of ***Pearls*** that it may provide in the diagnosis of a number of *special* but *important* situations. These include identification \\(*or at least suggestion*\\) of the following:\n\n+ **LMCA** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\)** disease** or **occlusion** \\(*Section 09.40*\\). \n+ ***Proximal* LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending*\\)** occlusion** \\(*Section 09.40*\\). \n+ ***Severe* Coronary Artery Disease** \\(*Section 09.40*\\). \n+ **Lead Misplacement/Dextrocardia** \\(*Section 09.32*\\). \n+ ***Acute* Pulmonary Embolus** \\(*Section 09.33*\\). \n+ ***Acute* Pericarditis** \\(*Section 09.34*\\). \n+ **Atrial Infarction** \\(*Section 09.35*\\). \n+ ***Confirmation* of Ventricular Tachycardia** \\(*Section 09.37*\\). \n+ **Diagnosis of *some* SVT Rhythms** \\(*Section 09.36*\\). \n+ **TCA** \\(*TriCyclic Antedepressant*\\)** Overdose** \\(*Section 09.38*\\). \n+ **Takotsubo Syndrome** \\(*Section 09.39*\\). \n\n \n\nOur goal in this last part of Section 09 — is to illustrate how use of **lead aVR** may serve as a *valuable* adjunct to ECG interpretation. Some of the tracings shown here have already been encountered. Others will be encountered again when addressing future topics \\(*such as acute pericarditis*\\). The ***common* “theme”** — is that by *actively* incorporating assessment of **lead aVR** into your systematic approach, diagnostic accuracy will improve for a surprising number of clinical conditions\\!\n\n+ **NOTE:** Much of what follows represents ***advanced* concepts** that less experienced interpreters need *not* necessarily concern themselves with *unless* looking to learn more. We emphasize that **lead aVR** is *not* essential for the basics of ECG interpretation. That said — awareness of the insight that using lead aVR may provide will help advance your ECG interpretation ability to the *next* level. \n\n \n\n**09.32 – Lead aVR: *Recognizing Lead Misplacement/Dextrocardia***\n\nWe devoted Section 03 to discussion of lead derivation and recognition of potential technical errors in lead placement. The remote, *right-sided* location of *augmented* **lead aVR** \\(*looking down at the heart from perspective of the right shoulder*\\) — provides a unique viewpoint that allows rapid recognition when something is amiss \\(Figure 09.32-1\\).\n\n+ The ECG waveform in **lead aVR** is derived from the *difference* in electrical potential between that recorded from the RA \\(*right arm*\\) electrode — *minus* the potential recorded from a central reference point. \n+ As shown in **Figure 09.32-1** — the remote *right-sided* and *superior* location of **lead aVR** typically records a complex that manifests ***global* negativity** \\(*of the P wave, QRS and T wave*\\). While *other* conditions exist that may produce a complex with significant R wave positivity in lead aVR \\(ie, *RVH, COPD, conduction defects, etc*.\\) — the ***possibility*** of ***technical* error** should *at least* be contemplated when the QRS in lead aVR is predominantly positive. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.32-1:** Hexaxial lead system \\(*reproduced from* Figure 03.4-1\\). The remote *superior* and *right-sided* perspective of **lead aVR** \\(*looking down at the heart from the right shoulder*\\) — typically results in an ECG appearance of ***global* negativity** \\(*negative P wave, QRS and T wave*\\) in lead aVR, since predominant electrical activity is seen as moving *away* from this remote lead. **NOTE:** Exceptions exist \\(*the P wave and T wave in aVR are not always negative*\\) — but in general, the finding of a predominantly *positive* narrow QRS complex in lead aVR should prompt one to contemplate RVH, COPD or some technical error/dextrocardia.\n\nConsider the ECG in **Figure 09.32-2**:\n\n+ What is *unusual* about lead aVR? \n+ What is *unusual* about lead I? \n+ Why does this tracing *not* represent dextrocardia? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.32-2:** What are the *unusual* findings in leads I and aVR of this tracing \\(*ECG reproduced from* Figure 03.16-1\\). Why does this tracing *not* represent dextrocardia? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.32-2:** Two findings should *immediately* capture your eye in assessing this 12-lead tracing: **i\\)** There is ***global* negativity** in **lead I** \\(*the P wave, QRS and T wave are all negative*\\); and **ii\\) Lead aVR** does *not* look as we normally expect it to look.\n\n+ Given the ***left-sided* location** of **lead I** — there should virtually *never* normally be global negativity \\(*of P wave, QRS, T wave*\\) in this lead. *Think dextrocardia* or *limb lead reversal\\!* \n+ Support that something is *amiss* is forthcoming from ***assessment*** of **lead aVR**. Note that *both* the P wave and T wave are positive in aVR. In addition — there is an initial *positive* r wave deflection, instead of the QS or Qr complex that is most commonly seen in this lead. \n+ Whatever might be wrong in Figure 09.32-2 is *not* a result of dextrocardia. We say this because R wave progression is normal — with transition \\(*where the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep*\\) occurring between lead V3-to-V4, which is normal. R wave progression should be *reversed* IF the heart was situated in the *right* side of the thorax. \n\n \n\nThe possibility of **limb lead *reversal*** is easily settled by ***repeat* ECG** after verifying lead position \\(**Figure 09.32-3**\\). With limb leads now *correctly* placed — Note the following:\n\n+ **Lead I** in Fig. 09.32-3 now manifests a *positive* P wave, QRS complex and T wave, as it normally does. \n+ **Lead aVR** *now* shows ***global* negativity** \\(*of P wave, QRS and T wave*\\) — as it most commonly does when lead placement is normal. \n+ **R wave progression** is ***unchanged*** compared to Figure 09.32-2. Since the technical error only involved reversal of 2 *limb* leads \\(*mixing up of the right and left arm electrodes*\\) — there was *no* alteration of precordial lead R wave progression. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.32-3:** The ECG initially recorded in Figure 09.32-2 has been repeated after *verifying* correct limb lead placement. Note that the R wave in lead I is now *positive* — and global *negativity* has been restored to lead aVR — but that R wave progression is *unchanged*. This confirms **limb lead *reversal*** as the cause of the *unusual* ECG findings that were seen in Figure 09.32-2 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** — Technical errors will *definitely* be seen from time to time. Dextrocardia is rare — but important to recognize when it does occur. ***Full Review*** of this subject is covered in **Section 03**. Suffice it to say here — that attention to **lead aVR** is an easy way to facilitate recognizing *many* of the common technical mishaps \\(**Figure 09.32-4**\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 09.32-4:** Limb lead appearance in **Panel A** should *immediately* suggest something is amiss. This is because: **i\\)** there is global *negativity* in **lead I**, which is virtually *never* seen under normal circumstances; **ii\\) Lead aVR** shows ***global* positivity** \\(*which is also virtually never seen normally*\\); and **iii\\)** the P wave is *not* upright in **lead II** \\(*which means either a non-sinus rhythm; dextrocardia, or lead reversal*\\). IF the precordial lead sequence for the limb leads in Panel A looked like **Panel B** \\(*which shows normal R wave progression*\\) — We would suspect left and right arm limb lead reversal. But IF the precordial lead sequence looked like **Panel C** — the *reverse* R wave progression in C would strongly suggest dextrocardia \\(*See Section 03.11 for more details*\\).\n\n**09.33 – Lead aVR: *in Acute Pulmonary Embolus***\n\nInterpret the ECG shown in Figure 09.33-1 — obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock and acute hypoxemia.\n\n+ What *clinical* condition is suggested by this history and the *combination* of ECG findings seen in **Figure 09.33-1**? \n+ Does this clinical diagnosis account for the **ST elevation** seen in **lead aVR**? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.33-1:** ECG obtained from a patient who presented with syncope, shock and acute hypoxemia \\(*reproduced from* Figure 08.32-1\\). What ***clinical* diagnosis** would account for *all* of the ECG findings seen in this tracing \\(*including ST elevation in lead aVR*\\)?\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.33-1:** As discussed in detail in Sections 08.34 *through* 08.38 — the history and ***combination*** of **ECG findings** in Figure 09.33-1 should strongly suggest the diagnosis of submassive ***acute* PE** \\(*Pulmonary Embolism*\\). **ECG findings** supportive of this diagnosis include:\n\n+ Sinus tachycardia. \n+ RBBB \\(*Right Bundle Branch Block*\\). \n+ Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities consistent with RV “strain”. \n+ S1Q3T3 pattern \\(*Section 08.36*\\). \n+ **ST elevation** that is essentially ***limited*** to **lead aVR** and lead V1. \n\n \n\nWe emphasize — that one can *not* rule out the possibility of acute *anterior* MI from the ECG shown in Figure 09.33-1. That said — virtually *all* facets of the history and this ECG can be explained by one *unifying* diagnosis = a hemodynamically *significant* **large *acute* PE**.\n\n+ Anterior \\(*as well as inferior*\\) ST-T wave abnormalities as seen in Figure 09.33-1 are consistent with RV “strain”. \n+ Very *few* conditions produce **ST elevation** that is ***most* marked** in **lead aVR** — but minimal to *nonexistent* elsewhere, with possible exception of *right-sided* lead V1. One of these conditions is ***acute* PE**, as a result of acute *right* heart “strain” \\(*as seen in this case*\\). This patient was found to have a large saddle embolus. \n\n \n\n**09.34 – Lead aVR: *in Acute Pericarditis***\n\nAcute pericarditis is discussed in detail in Section 12. The hallmark of the **ECG diagnosis** of ***acute* pericarditis** is ***generalized* ST elevation** that occurs in a clinical setting consistent with this diagnosis. *Reciprocal* ST depression and large Q waves are *absent*. ST elevation typically manifests an *upward* concavity \\(*“smiley”-shape*\\) in most leads — with possible exception of *right-sided* leads \\(*leads aVR, V1 and sometimes lead III*\\) that may show T wave inversion.\n\n+ In addition to *generalized* ST elevation — **PR segment *depression*** in at least *several* leads \\(*below the TP baseline*\\) is another helpful clue in support of the ECG diagnosis of acute pericarditis. PR depression is well seen in Figure 09.34-1 \\(*red arrows*\\). \n+ The value of using **lead aVR** when contemplating a diagnosis of acute pericarditis — is that this lead often manifests **PR segment *elevation*** \\(*blue arrow in* Figure 09.34-1\\). As will be emphasized in Section 12 — PR segment depression is far from definitive for confirming acute pericarditis. Nevertheless, recognition of **PR depression** in *several* leads in association with **PR *elevation*** in **lead aVR** — *together* with:** i\\)** generalized *concave-up* ST elevation in the *absence* of reciprocal ST depression; and **ii\\)** a clinical setting *consistent* with acute pericarditis — go a long way toward increasing our comfort level in the likelihood of this diagnosis. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.34-1:** ECG obtained from a 35-year old man with *atypical* chest pain. The ECG diagnosis of ***acute* pericarditis** is suggested by: **i\\)** *generalized* concave-up ST elevation; **ii\\)** *absence* of reciprocal ST depression; **iii\\)** *absence* of large Q waves; **iv\\)** PR depression in a number of leads \\(*red arrows*\\); and **v\\) PR *elevation*** in **lead aVR** \\(*blue arrow*\\). Acute pericarditis is discussed in detail in Section 12.\n\n**09.35 – Lead aVR: *in Atrial Infarction***\n\nAtrial infarction is rare. ECG findings are subtle and often overlooked. As a result — most cases of atrial infarction are only diagnosed post-mortem on autopsy study. *Realistically* Speaking — being able to diagnose acute atrial infarction is unlikely to alter management. As a result — one is probably *none the worse* IF you *ignore* routinely looking for signs of atrial infarction \\(*as many clinicians seem to do*\\). That said — ***recognition*** of **acute *atrial* infarction** may explain *abrupt* onset of *supraventricular* arrhythmias that are prone to occur in association with *acute* MI. We therefore include this subject as an *advanced* topic. ***Consider*** the possibility of **acute *atrial* infarction** in the following clinical setting\\(s\\) — and in the presence of the following **ECG signs**:\n\n+ There is an **ongoing *acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\) that appears to be large \\(*as suggested by significant ST elevation and marked reciprocal ST depression*\\). \n+ Proximal occlusion of a major coronary artery is suggested by the ECG or acute catheterization picture \\(*the SA nodal artery is supplied by the Right Coronary Artery in ~60% of cases — with the circumflex accounting for most of the rest, though anatomic variations are possible*\\). By far, **acute *inferior* MI** — is the most common location for *acute* MI associated with atrial infarction. Whether this is the result of more likely origin for the SA nodal artery from the RCA — or due to the much higher oxygen content of left atrial blood is uncertain. There is often *associated* ECG evidence of **acute *posterior*** and **RV **\\(*Right Ventricular*\\) **involvement** — supporting the likelihood of *proximal* RCA occlusion \\(**Figure 09.35-1**\\). \n+ There is ***abrupt* onset** of **AFib** or *other* atrial tachyarrhythmia in association with *acute* STEMI. Less commonly there may be PR interval prolongation, sinus pauses or sinus arrest. Abrupt loss of the atrial kick in a patient with a large acute MI may result in sudden cardiac decompensation \\(*from acute heart failure*\\). \n+ In addition to *acute* STEMI \\(*usually from inferior MI*\\) — there are ***acute* PTa deviations** \\(*elevation or depression of the T wave component of the preceding P wave, during which time atrial repolarization takes place = “PTa” wave*\\). These PTa segment deviations may vary in lead location, depending on *which* atrium and *what part* of the atria is infarcting \\(*left or right atrium; atrial free wall or appendage*\\). The ECG picture in *schematic* **Figure 09.35-1** — is typical for the changes one might expect with acute right atrial infarction. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.35-1:** *Schematic* ECG illustrating expected findings from acute right atrial infarction. Note: **i\\)** underlying acute *infero-postero* MI; **ii\\)** PTa segment depression in the *inferior* leads \\(*red arrows*\\) — and perhaps also in V2; and **iii\\) PTa elevation** in **lead aVR** and lead V1 \\(*green arrows*\\). *Beyond-the-Core:* Proximal RCA occlusion is suggested in this schematic tracing by the finding of *more* ST elevation in lead III than lead II and by *marked* ST depression in lead aVL. Acute RV involvement is suggested by the relatively flat ST segment in lead V1 in the face of *marked* ST depression in V2. *Right-sided* leads could confirm acute RV involvement.\n\nNow look at the ECG in **Figure 09.35-2** — obtained from a patient with chest pain. There is obvious acute *inferior* STEMI — which is most probably from acute RCA occlusion \\(*marked ST elevation in lead III \u003e II; marked ST depression in lead aVL*\\). ST depression in leads V1 and V2 suggest associated *posterior* involvement.\n\n+ Do you *also* see ECG signs suggestive of **acute *atrial* infarction** in Figure 09.35-2? *Wouldn’t it be easy to overlook this?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.35-2:** Acute *infero-postero* STEMI. In addition — there is ECG evidence of **acute *atrial* infarction**. This is suggested by PTa depression in leads II,III,aVF and V5,V6 \\(*red arrows*\\) — *plus* **PTa elevation** in **lead aVR** \\(*blue arrow*\\).\n\n***Bottom* Line:** Atrial infarction is rare. Even when present, this diagnosis is rarely made by ECG while the patient is still alive — as ECG signs are often extremely subtle \\(Figure 09.35-2\\). Nevertheless — attention to the clinical setting and recognition of PTa segment deviations \\(*PR segment elevation or depression*\\) may suggest the diagnosis and explain certain potential complications of acute myocardial infarction. This is an *advanced* topic that clearly extends *“beyond-the-core”*.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Note that *both* acute pericarditis \\(Figure 09.34-1\\) — *and* atrial infarction \\(Figure 09.35-2\\) — are examples of relatively uncommon *clinical* conditions that may result in **PR depression** in several leads *with* **PR *elevation*** in **lead aVR**. Clinical circumstances and the *overall* ECG picture allow easy distinction between these 2 conditions. \n\n \n\n**Reference:** Shakir DK, Arafa SOE: *Right Atrial Infarction, Atrial Arrhythmia and Inferior MI from a Missed Triad: Case Report \u0026 Review of the Literature*. Can J Cardiol 23:995-997, 2007.\n\n**09.36 – Lead aVR: *in Supraventricular Arrhythmias***\n\nAmong the most helpful uses of lead aVR is in the interpretation of cardiac arrhythmias. **Lead aVR** may be ***beneficial*** in **2 *principal* ways**: **i\\)** in detecting subtle *atrial* activity in certain *supraventricular* tachyarrhythmias \\(*Section 09.36*\\); and **ii\\)** in making a definitive diagnosis of VT \\(*Section 09.37*\\).\n\n+ In general — the *best* lead to look at for assessment of atrial activity is **lead II**. This is because IF the **P wave** is ***upright*** and conducting in lead II \\(ie, *the PR interval is constant*\\) — then there is ***sinus* rhythm**. In addition — P wave amplitude is often greatest in lead II, which makes P waves easy to see under normal circumstances. \n+ The *next-best* lead to look at for assessment of atrial activity is **lead V1**. This is because this *right-sided* lead conveniently provides an *anatomically* close electrical perspective of normal atrial activity as the atria are depolarized. \n+ Clinically — atrial activity is *not* always clearly evident in leads II and V1. This is especially true for certain *regular* SVT \\(*SupraVentricular Tachycardia*\\) rhythms — in which the rapid rate results in a *shortening* of the R-R interval. This may provide a “cover” \\(*the preceding T wave*\\) — within which atrial activity may be hiding. The unique electrical vantage point of **lead aVR** may occasionally help to overcome this problem by providing a clue to underlying atrial activity that may *not* be as readily evident in *other* leads \\(**Figure 09.36-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.36-1:** 12-lead ECG demonstrating a ***regular* SVT rhythm** at ~150/minute *without* normal atrial activity \\(ie, *no upright P wave in lead II*\\). **Question:** Is there evidence of ***atrial* activity** in ***other* leads?** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.36-1:** The rhythm is a ***regular* SVT** at **~150/minute** — but *without* normal atrial activity \\(*since lead II does not show an upright P wave*\\). The principal ***differential* diagnosis** consists of 3 entities:** i\\)** Sinus tachycardia; **ii\\)** PSVT; and **iii\\)** Atrial flutter. As discussed in Section 02.19 — looking at ***additional* leads** in the hope of identifying ***atrial* activity** may be insightful.\n\n+ **PEARL:** Use of ***calipers*** facilitates the process. Setting one’s calipers at *precisely* half the R-R interval — allows you to walk out atrial activity in several leads \\(**Figure 09.36-2**\\). This ***confirms*** the diagnosis of **AFlutter** with 2:1 AV conduction \\(*atrial rate = 300/minute; ventricular rate = 150/minute*\\). \n+ Note how helpful looking at **lead aVR** is in Figure 09.36-2 — for increasing our level of comfort that 2:1 AV conduction is *truly* present. Clear demonstration of 2:1 AV conduction in multiple leads \\(*red and blue arrows*\\) may obviate diagnostic need for performing a vagal maneuver. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.36-2:** Arrows have been added to Figure 09.36-1 to facilitate recognition of atrial activity. Note that 2 *evenly-spaced* negative deflections are present for each QRS complex in lead II \\(*red arrows*\\). Regular flutter waves are also well seen in **lead aVR**, as well as in selected other leads \\(*blue arrows*\\).\n\n**Retrograde Atrial Activity:** Another way in which *additional* leads may facilitate diagnosis of *regular* SVT rhythms — is in identifying ***retrograde* atrial activity**. Our 2 *“favorite”* leads to look for *retrograde* P waves in — are **lead aVR** and **lead V1** \\(Figure 09.36-3\\).\n\n+ As emphasized in Section 02.29 and Section 02.30 — **PSVT** is a ***reentry* tachycardia** that usually involves at least *some* portion of the AV node. Confirmation that ***reentry*** is the mechanism of a *regular* SVT rhythm when normal P waves are absent — is forthcoming from identifying *retrograde* atrial activity *during* the tachycardia. \n+ ***Retrograde* P waves** during PSVT are often subtle, if evident at all. They may be nothing more than a *tiny* notch seen in the *terminal* portion of the QRS in one or more of the *inferior* leads \\(*red arrows in* **Figure 09.36-3**\\). \n+ Support that such notching is *real* and a reflection of *retrograde* atrial activity — is forthcoming from identifying retrograde P waves in *other* leads. While ***retrograde* P waves** are *negative* when seen in lead II or other inferior leads — they are generally ***positive*** when seen in **lead V1** *and/or* **lead aVR** \\(*blue arrows in* Figure 09.36-3\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.36-3:** *Regular* SVT rhythm *without* normal P waves at a rate of ~180/minute \\(*reproduced from* Figure 02.30-1\\). Retrograde atrial activity is suggested by subtle *negative* notching in the terminal part of the QRS in each of the inferior leads \\(*red arrows — which are best seen in the lead II blow-up in the center of the tracing*\\). Support that such notching is *real* and reflects *retrograde* P waves from a *reentry* mechanism — is forthcoming from the “pseudo-r-prime” \\(*positive terminal notching*\\) that is seen in the QRS complex in *both* leads aVR and V1 \\(*blue arrows*\\). This ***confirms* reentry** and the diagnosis of **PSVT** as the mechanism of the arrhythmia \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.37 – Lead aVR: *for Definitive Diagnosis of VT***\n\nIn Sections 02.47 *through* 02.51 — We emphasized the importance of *always* assuming a ***regular* WCT** \\(*Wide-Complex Tachycardia*\\) **rhythm** was **VT** \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\) until *proven* otherwise. This is because:** i\\)** VT is by far \\(*\u003e80-90% of the time*\\) the most common cause of a *regular* WCT rhythm when sinus P waves are *not* evident; and **ii\\)** VT is the most serious cause of a *regular* WCT. That said — *Wouldn’t it be nice *to be able to *increase* our diagnostic *certainty* that a *regular* WCT was VT *beyond* this 80-90% likelihood probability?\n\n+ Consider the ***regular* WCT rhythm** shown in **Figure 09.37-1** — obtained from an adult with a history of heart disease. *How certain* are you that the rhythm is VT? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.37-1:** *Regular* WCT rhythm obtained from a patient with heart disease. *How certain* are you that the rhythm is VT? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.37-1:** The rhythm is a ***regular* WCT** at **~180/minute**. There is no sign of atrial activity. **VT** should be assumed *until* proven otherwise \\(**LIST \\#1** — *from* Figure 02.47-1\\).\n\n+ In **Section 02.50** — We emphasized how use of **3 *Simple* Rules** can increase diagnostic likelihood *beyond* the 90% probability level predicted by the presence of any *regular* WCT rhythm in an adult with heart disease. Applying these **3 *Simple* Rules** from Section 02.50 to the rhythm in Figure 09.37-1 — Note that there is: **i\\)** *extreme* axis deviation \\(*entirely negative QRS in lead aVF*\\); **ii\\)** amorphous = “ugly” and *very* wide QRS morphology \\(*the QRS is well over 0.16 second in duration*\\); and **iii\\)** an almost *entirely* negative QRS complex in lead V6. We estimate that these ECG findings during tachycardia increase VT likelihood to ~98%. \n+ The *additional* finding of an ***entirely* upright** \\(*monophasic*\\) **QRS complex** in **lead aVR** during this WCT rhythm increases ***diagnostic* certainty** of **VT** to ***virtually* 100%**\\! This is because the *only* way a monophasic \\(*entirely positive*\\) QRS complex can be seen in lead aVR during WCT — is IF the electrical impulse originates from a site in the ventricular apex. *Nothing else other than VT does this* \\(**Figure 09.37-2**\\). \n+ In contrast — we learn *nothing* about the etiology of a WCT rhythm IF lead aVR is either initially negative — or manifests anything but a large monophasic R wave \\(*2nd and 3rd examples in *Figure 09.37-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.37-2:** The finding of a **large *monophasic* R wave** in **lead aVR** during a WCT rhythm is ***diagnostic*** of **VT** with virtual 100% accuracy. In contrast — *anything but* a large *monophasic* R wave \\(*2nd and 3rd examples in this figure*\\) is of *no* diagnostic utility in differentiation \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**BOTTOM Line:** The criterion of a **monophasic *upright* R wave** in **lead aVR** is admittedly insensitive. As a result — this finding will only be seen in a minority of WCT rhythms. Nevertheless, we mention it as a ***special* use** of **lead aVR** in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias — because in those few cases when a monophasic R wave is seen in lead aVR \\(**Figure 09.37-3**\\) — the diagnosis of VT is *virtually* assured.\n\n+ As should be obvious — diagnosis of VT is *overwhelmingly* likely in Figure 09.37-3, even *without* use of lead aVR. That said — once lead aVR appearance is noted, there is *no longer* the *slightest* doubt that the rhythm is VT \\(*which allows us to focus full effort on treatment*\\). \n\n \n\n**Reference:** Sasaki K: *A New Simple Algorithm for Diagnosing Wide QRS Complex Tachycardia: Comparison with Brugada, Vereckei and aVR Algorithms*. Circulation 120:S671, 2009.\n\n\n\n**Figure 09.37-3:** We reproduce Figure 09.37-1 — with a *blow-up* insert of lead aVR. The presence of a *monophasic* R wave in lead aVR makes diagnosis of VT a virtual certainty \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**09.38 – Lead aVR: *in TCA Overdose ***\n\n*Severe* **TCA** \\(*TriCyclic Antidepressant*\\) **Overdose** — may produce characteristic ECG manifestations that are in part defined by **lead aVR**. Although far less commonly encountered than in the past — *severe* TCA poisoning is still occasionally seen. It is well to remember that overdose of *other* medications \\(ie, *quinidine; procainamide; flecainide*\\) may produce a similar ECG picture of sodium-channel blockade. The principal ***adverse* effects** of ***severe* TCA overdose** include: **i\\)** Neurotoxicity \\(*seizures; delirium*\\); and **ii\\)** Cardiovascular toxicity \\(*life-threatening ventricular tachydysrhythmias; myocardial depression; hypotension; preterminal bradycardia*\\). The **ECG picture** may be unique \\(Figure 09.38-1\\) — and is recognized by the following:\n\n+ **Sinus Tachycardia** — is almost always seen with severe TCA ingestion until very late in the course \\(*ultimately there may be preterminal bradycardia*\\). \n+ **QRS prolongation** — to at least 0.10 second. Rather than the QT — it is QRS prolongation that best predicts severity of the overdose. Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias are more likely once QRS duration exceeds 0.16 second. Of interest — QRS prolongation especially affects the *terminal* portion of the QRS, such that the initial part of the QRS is often not overly abnormal. \n+ **RAD** \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) — which manifests as: **i\\)** a wide terminal S wave in lead I; and **ii\\)** a ***prominent* R’** \\(*\u003e3mm tall*\\) in **lead aVR**, that is often taller than the S wave is deep in this lead. \n+ *Predisposition* to ***potentially* lethal VT** \\(*Ventricular Tachycardia*\\). \n+ ***Other* ECG findings** that may be seen in severe TCA overdose include: **i\\)** QT prolongation; **ii\\)** PR interval prolongation; **iii\\)** RBBB; **iv\\)** a transient Brugada pattern in anterior precordial leads. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** Given that **ECG signs** of ***severe* TCA toxicity** include: **i\\)** *marked* QRS widening and **ii\\)** PR as well as QT prolongation — it may at times be difficult \\(*if not impossible*\\) to distinguish between: **i\\)** sinus tachycardia with a wide QRS and 1st-degree AV block \\(*with P waves hidden within tall T waves made prominent by QT prolongation*\\); vs **ii\\)** VT.\n\n+ Fortunately — clinical distinction between these 2 forms of *wide-complex* tachycardia \\(*VT vs sinus tach*\\) is *not* essential for appropriate *initial* management because: **i\\) *Sodium* Bicarbonate** is recommended as the drug of choice *regardless* of whether the wide rhythm is sinus tachycardia or VT; and **ii\\)** antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol or flecainide are all contraindicated for treatment of VT with TCA overdose \\(*because these agents may all aggravate myocardial depression, hypotension, and conduction defects*\\). \n+ ***Bottom* Line:** Clinical context \\(ie, *that the patient overdosed on a TCA*\\) — *prior* ECGs on the patient — and *serial* tracings may sometimes be needed in order to become comfortable distinguishing between sinus tachycardia with severe TCA poisoning vs VT \\(**Figure 09.38-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.38-1:** ECG obtained from a young adult who presented to the ED after TCA overdose. Characteristic **ECG signs** of ***severe* TCA toxicity** are present. These include: **i\\)** Tachycardia; **ii\\)** *Marked* QRS widening \\(*to at least 0.16 second*\\) — with QRS widening primarily affecting the *terminal* portion of the QRS complex; **iii\\)** RAD — as manifest by a wide terminal S wave in lead I *as well as by* a **very *tall* R’ component** in **lead aVR** \\(*well over 3mm in amplitude*\\); and **iv\\)** RBBB. **NOTE:** We are *not* certain IF the rhythm in Figure 09.38-1 represents VT \\(*marked QRS widening; marked right axis; absence of normal atrial activity in lead II; predominant S wave in lead V6*\\) — or a *supraventricular* tachycardia with *marked* QRS widening from *severe* TCA toxicity \\(*it looks as if P waves may be present in lead V2*\\). In the context of *severe* TCA toxicity, it probably does *not* matter — since *initial* management entails Sodium Bicarbonate and *avoidance* of antiarrhythmic drugs *regardless* of the etiology of the rhythm \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Acknowledgement:** My appreciation to Andrew Bowman for allowing me to publish \\(*with slight modification*\\) the ECG in Figure 09.38-1.\n\n**References:**\n\ni\\) Thanacoody HKR, Thomas SHL: *Tricyclic Antidepressant Poisoning*.

ECG changes are often *out-of-proportion* to the clinical picture. Among the many ECG findings that may be seen are ST segment elevation in lead aVR.\n\n+ *See* Section 10.61 for more on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy. \n\n \n\n**09.40 – Lead aVR: *Severe CAD/Left Main Disease***\n\nWe have found use of **lead aVR** to be extremely helpful in assessing certain more severe forms of CAD \\(*Coronary Artery Disease*\\) — especially with involvement of multiple vessels *and/or* with left main disease. The illustrative examples that follow hopefully convey this key concept. NOTE: Use of lead aVR in this manner is an *advanced* topic.\n\n+ The remote *superior* and *right-sided* electrical viewpoint of **lead aVR** \\(*looking down at the heart from the right shoulder*\\) — provides a unique vantage point that assesses the ***basal* part** of the ***interventricular* septum**. Ischemia of the septum \\(*as may occur with severe left main disease*\\) produces a vector that points superiorly — resulting in **ST *elevation*** in **lead aVR**. There will often be associated ST elevation in lead aVL and ST depression in the inferior leads\\). \n+ *Similar* ECG findings may often be seen with **acute *proximal* LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending*\\)** occlusion**, in which there is involvement of the 1st septal artery branch. \n+ In contrast to *proximal* LAD occlusion — **more *distal* LAD occlusion** generally does *not* involve the same area of the septum. As a result — ST elevation in lead aVR is *not* seen. Instead — ST elevation is most marked in *anterior* leads \\(*V2,V3,V4*\\). \n+ Assessment of the *clinical* significance of ST elevation in lead aVR is complicated by the fact that this lead provides reciprocal \\(*mirror-image*\\) information to one or more lateral leads. Specifically — ST depression in leads II, aVL, V5,V6 may result in some ST elevation in aVR *independent* of septal involvement. \n\n \n\n**PEARL:** Distinction between *left-main* disease vs *proximal* LAD occlusion may be suggested on ECG by the ***relative* amount** of **ST elevation** seen in **lead aVR** *compared to* **lead V1**.\n\n+ Think ***Left-Main*** disease — when ST elevation in lead aVR \u003e V1. \n+ Think ***proximal* LAD** disease/occlusion — when ST elevation in lead V1 \u003e aVR. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Distinction should be made between ***acute* LMCA** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\)** occlusion** vs LMCA** disease.**\n\n+ Most patients with *acute* LMCA occlusion do *not* survive. As a result — this entity is *not* often seen and *unlikely* to be appreciated clinically. Rapid deterioration with patient demise due to cardiogenic shock is the usual result *unless* acute LMCA occlusion can be *immediately* recognized and *immediately* acted on. \n+ In those *rare* circumstances when *acute* LMCA occlusion is captured on ECG — rather than diffuse ST depression there should be diffuse precordial ST *elevation* in association with ST elevation in lead aVR. \n\n \n\nConsider the ECG shown in **Figure 09.40-1** — obtained from an older adult with a history of chest discomfort over time.\n\n+ What is the principal abnormality on this ECG? \\(HINT: *Look at the white arrows*\\). \n+ Clinically — Is CAD \\(*Coronary Artery Disease*\\) likely? If so — Can you comment on the likely *severity* of such CAD? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.40-1:** ECG obtained from an *older* adult with chest pain over time. *Diffuse* ST depression is seen \\(*white arrows*\\). In addition, there is ST elevation in leads aVR and V1 \\(*red arrows*\\). This pattern suggests ***severe* CAD** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.40-1:** An important pattern to recognize on ECG — is the finding of ***diffuse* ST depression** \\(*usually in ≥7-8 leads*\\) in association with **ST *elevation*** in **lead aVR**. These findings are seen in Figure 9.40-1:\n\n+ Especially when seen in an *older* adult — there is a *high* correlation with this ECG pattern and ***severe* CAD** \\(*usually 3-vessel — *or* proximal LAD/left main disease*\\). \n+ It is difficult to distinguish between *severe* 3-vessel disease vs a *proximal* LAD or left main lesion on the basis of this ECG alone. \n+ *Additional* findings of potential concern in Figure 09.40-1 are: **i\\)** that there is also some ST elevation in lead V1 and **ii\\)** that *incomplete* RBBB is present \\(*rSr’ in V1; tiny-but-present S waves in leads I,V6*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The ST elevation that is seen in lead V1 appears to be *minimal* and is *less* in amount than the ST elevation seen in lead aVR. As a result —the possibility of *left-main* disease should at least be considered. In contrast — *left-main* disease would be far *less* likely IF ST elevation in lead V1 was greater than in lead aVR. \n+ ***BOTTOM *Line****:** *Be aware* of the **ECG pattern** shown in Figure 09.40-1 — in which ST flattening with at least *some* depression is seen in *multiple* leads *in association with* ST elevation in lead aVR. Especially when seen in an older adult with symptoms consistent with angina — *severe* CAD is likely. \n\n \n\nNow consider the ECG shown in **Figure 09.40-2** — obtained from an acutely ill patient with severe *new-onset* chest pain. Having just emphasized how clinically *rare* it is to encounter a patient with ***acute* LMCA occlusion** — We feel this may be one exception. We note the following findings:\n\n+ There is sinus tachycardia and QRS widening due to **acute *bifascicular* block** \\(*RBBB/LAHB*\\). Although admittedly difficult to see the low amplitude upright P wave in lead II — it looks like there may *also* be 1st degree AV block. \n+ There is *marked* **diffuse ST elevation** \\(*in leads I,****aVL****; V1-through-V6; *and* in ****lead aVR***\\). There is marked ***reciprocal* ST depression** in inferior leads. \n+ Small **q waves** have already formed in leads aVL; V1,V2,V3. \n+ ST elevation is fairly marked \\(*at least 2-3mm*\\) in *both* lead aVR and in lead V1 \\(*red arrows*\\). While we *cannot* be sure if ST elevation is more in aVR or in V1 — this patient’s acute presentation in conjunction with new *bifascicular* block \\(*plus possible 1st degree AV block*\\) and the *dramatic* ST-T wave changes seen here \\(*with ****marked ST elevation**** in ***lead aVR**\\) support *high* likelihood of acute *proximal* occlusion \\(*of either the LMCA or proximal LAD*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.40-2:** ECG from an acutely ill patient with *new-onset* chest pain. New *bifascicular* block in context with *dramatic* ST-T wave changes seen here \\(*including* **ST elevation** *in* **lead aVR** *and in lead V1 — red arrows*\\) — suggest acute *proximal* occlusion of *either* the LAD or LCMA \\(*See text*\\).\n\nWe conclude Section 09.40 with the ECG shown in **Figure 09.40-3** — obtained from a woman with chest pain and heart failure. We previously encountered this ECG in Section 09.28 — at which time we focused attention on the *diffuse* ST segment depression that is seen \\(*red arrows*\\).\n\n+ **NOTE:** In addition to *diffuse* ST depression — there is also *significant* ST elevation in **lead aVR** of Figure 09.40-3. *Is this patient likely to have severe CAD *because there is diffuse ST depression *with* ST elevation in lead aVR? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 09.40-3:** ECG obtained from a woman with chest pain and heart failure \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.28-1\\). Note *diffuse* ST depression *with* ST elevation in lead aVR. Is this patient likely to have *severe* CAD? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 09.40-3:** As discussed in Section 09.28 — the rhythm is PSVT at a rate of ~180/minute. Although *diffuse* ST depression is present in association *with* ST elevation in lead aVR — this does *not* necessarily indicate significant coronary artery disease because there is *marked* tachycardia. Instead — each of the entities in **LIST \\#4** \\(*Section 09.26*\\) should be considered as possibly contributing to the ST depression that is seen. The list of common causes of ST depression includes: **i\\)** Ischemia; **ii\\)** “Strain”; **iii\\)** Digitalis effect; **iv\\)** Low serum K\\+/Mg\\+\\+; **v\\)** Rate-related changes \\(*from tachycardia*\\); and/or **vi\\) *Any* combination** of causes i\\) *through* v\\).\n\n+ We advise *against* even contemplating the possibility of severe CAD *until* after resolution of the tachycardia. Then *repeat* the ECG. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.0 – Acute MI / Ischemia**\n\n\n\n**10.1 – The Patient with Chest Pain: *WHY Do an ECG?***\n\nOne of the *KEY* reasons for obtaining an ECG is to help ***evaluate*** the patient with ***new-onset* CP** \\(*Chest Pain*\\). By doing so we hope to determine: **i\\)** IF there are *any* ***acute* ECG changes?** and **ii\\)** Is there evidence of ***prior* MI** \\(*Myocardial Infarction*\\)**?** Specifically — We *want* to know:\n\n+ Is there *ongoing* **ACS** \\(***A****cute ****C****oronary ****S****yndrome*\\)**?** This is determined by ***history*** — ***troponins*** — and by assessment of **acute** and ***serial* ECG changes**. \n+ If there is ACS — *What* area\\(s\\) of the heart are involved? — How *extensive* is the area of involvement? \n+ What is the cardiac rhythm? \\(*Any arrhythmias?*\\). \n+ Are there conduction defects? \\(*BBB? AV block?*\\). \n+ *KEY:* Is patient a ***candidate*** for ***acute* intervention?** \n\n \n\n**10.2 – *What is a “Silent” MI?***\n\nAs many as **1/3** of *all* infarcts are ***\"silent\"* MIs** — which means that these infarcts are *not* associated with chest pain. Approximately *half* of this group \\(ie, *~1/6 of all MI patients*\\) — have *“other”* symptoms \\(*but not chest pain*\\). These ***non-chest-pain-equivalent* symptoms** may include: **i\\)** acute dyspnea \\(*shortness of breath*\\); **ii\\)** GI symptoms; **iii\\)** vague myalgias or *flu-like* syndrome; or **iv\\)** mental status change \\(*especially confusion*\\). The *other half* of this group \\(~*1/6 of all MI patients*\\) — have ***no* symptoms** at all.\n\n+ Although ***“silent”* MI** is more common in the elderly — this entity may occur in *any* age group \\(*regardless of whether or not the patient has diabetes or other medical issue that might impair sensation*\\). \n+ By far — the most common of the *non-chest-pain equivalent* symptoms is shortness of breath\\! For this reason — We advise obtaining an **ECG** on virtually *any* adult of a certain age who presents with **unexplained *new-onset* dyspnea**. A “silent” MI may have precipitated pulmonary symptoms/heart failure. \n+ Awareness of the surprising *prevalence* of “silent” MI in the general population — should prompt you to inquire about a ***possible* “event”** \\(ie, *infarction*\\) whenever the patient presents with *unexplained* symptoms that might be attributable to an *undetected* recent infarction. Examples include: **i\\)** Recent *new* edema/heart failure but *without* a history of chest pain; and **ii\\)** *New* fatigue *and/or* confusion in an *older* patient *without* plausible explanation. Have a ***low* threshold** to obtain an **ECG** on such patients — even though they are *not* having chest pain. \n+ **Comparison** with a ***prior* ECG** may be ***invaluable*** for determining IF abnormalities seen on a current ECG are new or old. IF *old* records are *not* readily available — Use fax or cell phone transmission to *expedite* the process. \n+ ***Bottom *Line:** The entity of ***“silent”* MI** is much more ***common*** than is generally appreciated. Not all *“silent”* MIs are truly “silent”. Instead — ***other* symptoms** \\(*especially shortness of breath — but also confusion, malaise, etc.*\\) are commonly associated with this entity. Maintaining a ***high* index** of **suspicion** is essential in order not to overlook *previous* MIs that may have been subtle and without the usual symptom of *cardiac-sounding* chest pain. Comparison of the patient’s *current* ECG with a ***prior* ECG** may be invaluable and indicate that a patient you thought had no prior history of heart disease has actually *had* an MI at some time in the past. \n\n \n\n**10.3 – The ECG in *Acute* MI: *What are the Changes?***\n\nRecent years have seen *increased *emphasis on use of the ECG for evaluation of ACS. We look for ***acute* ECG changes** \\(Figure 10.3-1\\). The goal is to determine ASAP from *wherever* the patient is first seen — as to whether ***acute *intervention** is likely to be beneficial:\n\n+ The *KEY* is to recognize ***acute* STEMI** \\(***ST E****levation ****M****yocardial**** I****nfarction*\\) at the earliest opportunity — because this is the group of patients most likely to benefit from ***acute* reperfusion** \\(*angioplasty/stenting*\\) of the occluded vessel. \n+ ***Once acute STEMI *is* identified*** — the process of *notifying* cardiology and/or *activating* the cath lab is set into motion. This will *ideally* be accomplished within *minutes* of obtaining and interpreting the patient’s *initial* ECG. \n+ Most patients with **NSTEMI** \\(***N****on****-ST E****levation ****MI***\\) — do *not* need acute intervention. The reason for *expediting* assessment of the *initial* ECG is to find those who do. \n+ Realize that what *begins* as a *non*-ST-elevation picture — might *evolve* into an *acute* STEMI. This is the reason for having a *low* threshold for ***repeating* the ECG** \\(*sometimes more than once*\\) when evaluating a patient with new-onset *ongoing* chest pain. **NOTE:** Acute ECG changes may evolve *in as little as* 20-30 minutes. \n+ **ECG Indicators** of ***Acute* MI** — are shown in **Figure 10.3-1**: \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.3-1:** ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI: **1**\\) ST segment elevation; **2**\\) T wave inversion; **3**\\) Q wave development; and **4**\\) *Reciprocal* ST depression in *other* lead areas.\n\n**10.4 – ECG Indicators: 1\\) *ST Segment Elevation***\n\nThe hallmark of acute coronary artery occlusion *— *is **ST segment *elevation***. This ST elevation is typically seen in the leads that *overly* the area of acute infarction \\(**Panel 1** *in* Figure 10.3-1\\). In general *— *the *greater* the amount of ST elevation and the *more* leads showing ST elevation *— *the *larger* the size of the acute MI \\(*and the more the potential for benefit from acute reperfusion*\\).\n\n+ CAVEAT \\#1: *Not* all ST elevation is the result of *acute* MI. ***Other* Reasons** for **ST elevation** that may *not* be due to *acute* STEMI include: **i\\)** *Early* repolarization \\(*Section 09.19*\\); **ii\\)** *Ventricular* aneurysm \\(*suspected when ST elevation persists for months after a previous large infarction*\\); **iii\\)** *Acute* pericarditis \\(*Section 12.0*\\); and **iv\\) *Other* conditions** \\(*patients with LVH; LBBB; IVCD; cardiomyopathy may at times manifest long-term ST elevation in certain leads not due to acute stemi*\\). \n+ CAVEAT \\#2: **STEMI *“equivalent”* patterns** exist. The most notable example of this *— *is acute *posterior* MI that manifests *anterior* ST depression *instead* of elevation \\(*Section 10.33*\\); *Clinical* implications of a ***“stemi-equivalent”*** *— *are *identical* to those of *frank* STEMI. \n\n \n\n**10.5 – ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI: 2\\) *T Wave Inversion***\n\nCoronary ***ischemia*** is suggested by the ECG finding of ***symmetric* T wave inversion** \\(*as seen in* **Panel 2** *in* Figure 10.5-1\\). In general, the *deeper* the T wave inversion and the *more* leads involved *— *the *more extensive* the area of involvement is likely to be.\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.5-1:** ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.3-1\\). In the paragraphs below, we highlight assessment of *symmetric* T wave inversion \\(**Panel 2**\\).\n\nWhile emphasizing *pattern* recognition of ***symmetric* T wave inversion** as seen in **Panel 2** of Figure 10.5-1 *— *it is well to recall several caveats:\n\n+ CAVEAT \\#1: In addition to ischemia *— *there are ***other* reasons** for **T wave inversion**. These include: **i\\)** LVH or RVH *with* “strain” \\(*Section 08.9 and Section 08.28*\\); **ii\\)** *Acute* pulmonary embolus \\(*Section 08.37*\\); **iii\\)** *Juvenile* T wave variant \\(*Section 08.31*\\); **iv\\) *Other* conditions** \\(*medications; electrolyte disorders; BBB; cardiomyopathy; longstanding coronary artery disease; *and* various non-cardiac conditions may all manifest shallow or deep T wave inversion not due to an acute ischemic process*\\); plus **v\\)** A ***normal* variant pattern** \\(*Isolated symmetric T inversion may sometimes be seen as a normal variant in leads III, aVF, aVL, aVR, *and/or* V1 —* Section 09.12\\). \n+ CAVEAT \\#2: One can *not* tell IF even deep *symmetric* T inversion is *new* or *old* from looking at a *single* ECG. **Comparison** with a ***prior* tracing** is needed. The interpreter simply *describes* what is seen. \n+ CAVEAT \\#3: Even when *symmetric* T wave inversion is indicative of *acute* ischemia in a patient with *new-onset* chest pain *— *this does *not* necessarily mean that an *acute* MI is evolving. A ***tincture*** of **time** *— ****serial* ECGs** *— ***troponins** and ***clinical* follow-up** are all needed to determine IF *symmetric* T inversion present on *initial* ECG will *evolve* into a *Q-wave* or *non-Q-wave* infarction. \n\n \n\nConsider the two 6-lead sequences shown in **Figure 10.5-2**. In *both* Panel A *and* Panel B *— *there is ***symmetric* T wave inversion** in **lead III**.\n\n+ Which of these 2 sets of limb leads is more likely to represent ischemia? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.5-2:** Ischemic T wave inversion. **Panel A** — shows fairly deep, *symmetric* T wave inversion in lead III. T inversion in the *other* inferior leads \\(*leads II and aVF*\\) is *not* quite as deep — but it is present. We therefore interpret the picture in **Panel A** as highly suggestive of ***inferior* ischemia**. In contrast — **Panel B** \\(*which we have reproduced from* Figure 09.13-1\\) is much ***less* suggestive** of **ischemia** because: **i\\)** T inversion is minimal \\(*if present at all*\\) in lead aVF and *absent* in lead II; plus **ii\\)** the QRS complex is predominantly *negative* in lead III. This could be normal — since the T wave vector often follows close behind the QRS vector \\(*Section 09.13*\\). Clinical correlation will be important to further assess these assumptions \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.5-2:** The picture of ST segment *coving* and *symmetric* T wave inversion in lead III is of potential concern for *both* Panel A and Panel B. That said — we are clearly ***more* concerned** with **Panel A**.\n\n+ ST elevation or depression is always of more concern when ***similar* findings** are found in ***neighboring* leads**. Whereas T inversion/ST depression is seen in *each* of the *inferior* leads in **Panel A** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — T inversion is *isolated* to lead III in Panel B \\(*with no more than nonspecific ST flattening in lead aVF*\\). \n+ **Lead III** — is one of the leads that may *normally* manifest even *moderate-to-large* T wave inversion, without this being due to ischemia \\(*Section 09.12*\\). That this is the case in **Panel B** — is made more likely by the associated finding of a **predominantly *negative* QRS** complex in the lead showing T wave inversion. \n+ **NOTE**: We can *not* exclude the possibility of acute ischemia \\(*or even ongoing infarction*\\) from the limb lead sequence shown in Panel B. Clinical correlation and comparison with prior ECGs is needed to do so. But our suspicion of ischemia/infarction is clearly *less* for Panel B than it is for the limb lead sequence in Panel A. \n\n \n\n**10.6 – ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI: 3\\) *Q Waves***\n\nDevelopment of **Q waves** has long been thought of as the ***marker*** that ***myocardial* infarction** *has* taken place \\(**Panel 3** *in* Figure 10.6-1\\). In general, the *deeper* and *wider* a Q wave is and the *more* leads in a given lead area that manifest Q waves *— *the *more *likely it is that this ECG sign indicates ongoing or prior infarction. That said *— *there are important caveats to be aware of:\n\n+ CAVEAT \\#1: *Not* all patients with *acute* MI develop Q waves. Instead, there are ***non-Q-wave *infarctions** — in which *acute* MI is documented by history, *evolutionary* ECG changes and *positive* cardiac markers \\(**troponins**\\). \n+ Among patients who *do* develop Q waves with infarction — transmural \\(*full-thickness*\\) involvement is *not* necessarily needed for a Q wave to form. \n+ CAVEAT \\#2: When Q waves *do* develop — they do *not* necessarily last. Instead — Q waves may decrease in size with time. *They may even disappear*. As a result — the term, ***“significant Q wave”*** is **problematic**. Even a *small* Q wave may be *“significant”* in that it could be the *only* ECG sign remaining from a *prior* infarction. \n+ CAVEAT \\#3: There are ***other* reasons** for **Q waves** apart from serving as a marker of infarction. These include: **i\\)** Scarring, fibrosis, cardiomyopathy; **ii\\)** Lead placement errors \\(*Section 09.8*\\); **iii\\) *Other* conditions** \\(*patients with LVH; RVH/COPD; LBBB; LAHB; IVCD; chest wall deformity may all manifest poor R wave progression with resultant precordial Q waves — as listed in *Figure 09.7-1\\); plus** iv\\) *Normal* Variant** \\(*Be this in the form of normal small septal q waves *or* even moderate-to-large isolated Q waves in leads III, aVF, aVL, aVR, *and/or* V1*\\). Recognizing when Q waves are likely to reflect a *normal* finding was discussed in Section 09.12. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.6-1:** ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.3-1\\). In the paragraphs below, we highlight development of Q waves \\(**Panel 3**\\).\n\n**10.7 – Q Waves: *Why Do they Form? ***\n\nThe theory for genesis of Q waves is simple \\(**Figure 10.7-1**\\):\n\n+ After depolarization of the ventricular septum —** activation** of ***ventricular* myocardium** begins. If one thinks of the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\) as a *cylindrical* structure — the *initial milliseconds* of the activation process are directed *outward* everywhere as the electrical impulse begins on its path from *inner* endocardium \\(***Endo***\\) — to the *outer* epicardial \\(***Epi***\\) layer of the heart \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 10.7-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.7-1:** Genesis of Q waves. *Schematic* cross-sectional view of the heart. *Initial* electrical activity normally *cancels out* — as electrical activity is *opposing* everywhere \\(**Panel A**\\). The reason a **Q wave** forms over the area of infarction is that *null* electrical activity from myocardial necrosis is *no longer *opposed \\(**Panel B**\\). With ***posterior* infarction** \\(*shown in* **Panel C**\\) — a ***tall* R wave** is seen in *anterior* leads because of *loss* of posterior forces \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Looking *Closer* at Figure 10.7-1:** An important concept to emphasize — is that the overwhelming majority of electrical forces involved in activation of the heart cancel each other out. The ECG waveforms we see on an electrocardiogram represent the *less* than 10% of electrical forces are *not* directly opposing each other. This concept is well illustrated in **Panel A** of *schematic* Figure 10.7-1 — in which *virtually all* electrical forces during the *initial* milliseconds of ventricular depolarization cancel each other out \\(*Note arrows in* Panel A *oppose each other in all directions — resulting in a null vector for the very first instant during ventricular activation*\\).\n\n+ **Panel B** — schematically depicts what occurs during the initial milliseconds of ventricular activation in the presence of ***anterior* infarction** \\(*black area in *Panel B\\). The reason a **Q wave** develops over ***anterior* leads** — is that *outward-directed* posterior forces are now *unopposed* because of the null vector over the anterior area of infarction. \n+ **Panel C** — depicts what occurs with ***posterior* infarction** \\(*to be discussed in detail in Sections 10.33-through-10.37*\\). In this case — the *null* electrical vector \\(*black area*\\) lies posteriorly over the area of infarction. The result is *unopposed* forces that move anteriorly. This generates a ***tall* R wave** in ***anterior* leads**. \n\n \n\n**10.8 – ECG Terminology: *Distinction between Q, q and QS waves?***\n\nYou will often be asked to *verbally* describe the ECG findings noted on a given tracing. This becomes especially relevant when evaluating patients for acute or prior infarction. It is therefore important to clarify *semantics* of the **ECG Terminology** that is most commonly used for description \\(**Figure 10.8-1**\\):\n\n+ If a *negative* deflection *precedes* the QRS complex — it is termed a **Q wave**. \n+ The first *upward* deflection of the QRS complex is termed an **R wave**. If this is followed by a *second* upward deflection \\(*as occurs in lead V1 with RBBB*\\) — it is called an **R’** \\(*R prime*\\). \n+ The downward deflection that *follows* the R wave is termed an **S wave**. \\(NOTE: *An S wave is only said to be present *— *IF the negative deflection after the R wave descends below the baseline*\\). \n+ ***KEY* Point: **Given the importance of **Q waves** as a ***“marker”*** of **infarction** — the *initial* direction of the QRS complex should be *closely* scrutinized to determine IF it is up \\(*an r wave*\\) or down \\(*a q wave*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.8-1:** QRS Nomenclature. Although tiny — the *initial* QRS deflection in **Panel A** is upward. This deflection is therefore an **r wave**. In **Panel B** — the *initial* QRS deflection is *downward*. It is therefore a **q wave**. A ***lower* case** designation is used since this q wave in Panel B is *less* than 3mm in depth. In **Panel C** — there is a **QRs** complex \\(*a wide and deep Q wave* but *a small and narrow terminal s wave*\\). Since there is *no* R wave at all in **Panel D** — we describe the complex seen as a **QS** complex \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Large*** vs ***Small-Case* Designation** — *Large* deflections are denoted by *capital* letters. In contrast — ***smaller* deflections** \\(*that do not exceed ***3 mm*** = 3 little boxes*\\) are denoted by ***lower-case* letters**. Thus, we designate the QRS complex in **Panel A** of Figure 10.8-1 as an **“rS”** complex \\(*tiny initial r wave; deep S wave*\\). NOTE: The importance of recognizing that the *initial* deflection in Panel A is upright — is that *without* this tiny initial *positive* deflection, there would be a Q wave.\n\n+ **Panel B** — is a **qR** complex. The initial *negative* deflection is small and narrow \\(*a q wave*\\). This is followed by a tall upright \\(*R wave*\\) deflection. \n+ **Panel C** — is a **QRs** complex. The initial deflection is not only deep, but also quite wide. We call it a ***large* Q wave**. The tiny *negative* deflection following the tall R wave in Panel C is a small terminal s wave. \n+ **Panel D** — is designated a **“QS complex”**. Because there is *no* positive deflection \\(*R wave*\\) in Panel D — we are *unable* to distinguish between a Q wave, an S wave, or some *combination* of the two. **QS complexes** are commonly seen in the ***anterior* leads**. They may or may not serve as a marker of infarction \\(*Section 09.10*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.9 – Summary: *When are Q Waves Normal?***\n\nWe summarize below *KEY *points brought out in Sections 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 — regarding ECG assessment for the presence and significance of **Q waves**:\n\n+ The ***bigger*** and ***wider*** a **Q wave** is — the more likely it is that infarction has at *some* time occurred. This is especially true IF there is *more* than one Q wave in a given lead area. That said — *some* leads may *normally* manifest even *large *Q waves that are *not* necessarily indicative of infarction. These leads are III – aVR – aVL – aVF – and V1 \\(*See* **Figure 10.9-1** — *previously discussed in Section 09.12*\\). \n+ **NOTE:** Infarction Q waves may get smaller \\(*and even disappear*\\) with time. As a result — *small* size of a Q wave does *not* necessarily mean that no infarction has occurred. \n+ Small ***septal* q waves** — may ***normally*** be seen in one or more of the ***lateral* leads** \\(*leads I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\). These *septal* q waves should *not* be confused with infarction q waves. \n+ ***Clinical* correlation** and ***comparison*** with ***prior* tracings** is essential for optimal assessment of the meaning of Q waves. For example — Seeing small and *narrow* q waves limited to *lateral* leads in an otherwise *healthy* patient *without* acute ST-T wave changes strongly suggests that these q waves are benign. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.9-1:** *“Reverse Z”* memory aid \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.12-1\\) — for recalling the **5 leads** that may display even *large* **Q waves** *and/or* **T inversion** as an *isolated* finding in otherwise *healthy* adults who do *not* have heart disease \\(*See text and Section 09.12 for more details*\\).\n\n**10.10 – ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI: 4\\) *ST Segment Depression ***\n\nWe emphasized in Section 10.4, that with ***acute* coronary occlusion** *— *the ECG leads that *overly* the area of infarction manifest ***acute* ST elevation**. The opposite \\(*mirror-image*\\) picture is seen on ECG in *opposing* walls of the heart \\(**Figure 10.10-1**\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.10-1:** ECG Indicators of *Acute* MI \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.3-1\\). With ***acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\) — **ST elevation** is seen in leads that *overly* the area of acute infarction. The ***mirror-image*** picture \\(= ***reciprocal* ST depression**\\) is seen in *opposing* walls of the heart \\(**Panel 4**\\).\n\n***KEY* Clinical Points:** Given the *many* potential causes of ST elevation *other than* acute STEMI \\(*Section 10.4*\\) — the ECG finding of ***reciprocal* ST depression** often provides an ***invaluable* clue** that ECG changes are acute.\n\n+ *Reciprocal* ST depression is *not* found in either early repolarization or acute pericarditis. The *persistent* ST elevation of ventricular aneurysm is also rarely accompanied by more than minimal ST depression. \n+ The ***strongest* ECG evidence** that ST elevation is ***truly* acute** — is finding a virtual ***“mirror-image”* picture** of *reciprocal* ST depression. This concept is well illustrated in Figure 10.10-2 — in which one can readily appreciate how the ***shape*** of the *inferior* ST depression in **Panel A** would take on the *shape* of the ST elevation in leads I,aVL — IF the tracing was to be *flipped over* \\(**Panel B** *in* Fig. 10.10-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.10-2:** There is *marked* ST elevation in leads I and aVL. Note ***mirror-image*** \\(*reciprocal*\\) **ST depression** in *each* of the *inferior* leads \\(*leads II,III,aVF*\\). That is, the *depressed* ST-T wave seen in lead III from **Panel A** — would look virtually *identical* to the *elevated* ST-T wave shape in lead aVL IF in your mind’s eye you *flipped over* lead III \\(**Panel B**\\). With practice — you can readily recognize this ***mirror-image* picture** that is characteristic of *acute* reciprocal ST depression \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Regarding *Reciprocal* ST Depression:** The question arises as to *which* lead areas may manifest *reciprocal* ST depression with acute STEMI? Given the *cylindrical* configuration of the left ventricle — ***any other wall*** of the heart *not* showing ST elevation of acute STEMI **may manifest *reciprocal* ST depression**. That is, with acute *inferior* MI — *reciprocal* changes may be seen in anterior, lateral *and/or* posterior walls.\n\n+ As was the case for ST elevation \\(*Section 10.4*\\) — the *greater* the amount of *reciprocal* ST depression and the *more* leads showing ST depression — the *larger* the size the acute MI is likely to be \\(*and the more the potential for benefit from acute reperfusion*\\). \n+ CAVEAT: There are ***many*** potential **causes** of **ST depresssion** \\(*Section 09.26*\\). It will *not* always be easy to distinguish between ST depression due to ***primary* ischemia** or some ***other* cause** of ST depression \\(*LV “strain”; drug effect; electrolyte disturbance*\\) *—* vs ***reciprocal* changes** in a patient with *acute* infarction. That said *—*** ***clinical* correlation with assessment of the *overall* 12-lead ECG will usually indicate the clinical course to follow. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.11 – *Acute* MI: *The Sequence of ECG Changes ***\n\n\n\nTextbooks describe a sequence of *evolutionary* changes that occur during the course of *acute* infarction. For those patients who *“read the textbook”* prior to having their *acute* MI — ***schematic* Figure 10.11-1** shows the typical ***evolution* sequence** to expect during the course of an ***acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.11-1:** The typical *sequence* of ECG changes to expect during the course of *acute* STEMI \\(*See text*\\).\n\nRegarding the ***typical* sequence** of **ECG changes** during ***acute* MI**:\n\n+ **Panels A** *and* **B** \\(*in* Figure 10.11-1\\) — are *both* normal complexes. We include Panel A to remind that small and narrow ***“septal” *q waves** may be a ***normal* finding** in one or more ***lateral *leads** \\(*I,aVL,V4,V5,V6 *— *Section 10.9*\\). In contrast, the **Q waves** of *acute* MI tend to be bigger and wider — and infarction Q waves often *increase* in size during the course of acute MI. \n+ *Special* NOTE: On occasion — **small *septal* q waves** may also be seen in one or more ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) as a ***normal* finding**. This is especially true if the frontal plane axis is relatively vertical \\(ie, *close to 90 degrees*\\). \n+ **Panel C** \\(*in* Fig. 10.11-1\\) — shows the **\"*hyperacute*\" stage**, which is the *earliest* change during *acute* MI evolution. This stage may be *subtle* — because there may be *no more than* minimal ST elevation. ***Hyperacute* T waves** — are recognized by being broader *and* peaked — almost as if the T wave is \"trying\" to *lift up* the ST segment. Awareness of *hyperacute* changes is important — because it allows recognition of *acute* STEMI*-in-progress* at a time when *acute* intervention/reperfusion may provide *optimal* benefit. The ***hyperacute* stage** is usually *short-lived* — and it may resolve *within* as little as 1-2 hours. \n+ **Panel D** — Conventional **ST elevation follows** \\(*with ST coving = \"frowny\" shape*\\) — and *developing* Q waves. \n+ **Panels E** *and* **F** — Q waves become bigger; ST segment elevation peaks and **T wave *inversion*** begins. T waves evolve as the ST segment returns to baseline \\(*shown in* Panel F\\). **NOTE:** As opposed to the situation with ***acute* pericarditis** \\(*Section 12*\\) — the ST segment is often *still* a bit elevated with *acute* MI *at the time* that T wave inversion begins \\(**Panel F**\\). In contrast, with *acute* Pericarditis — the ST segment is *no longer* elevated in the *later* stage when there is T wave inversion. \n+ **Panel G** — ST-T wave abnormalities resolve \\(*or nearly resolve*\\) — but **Q waves *persist*** and serve as a ***marker*** that infarction has taken place. \n\n \n\n**10.12 – *Variation in the Sequence of Acute MI Changes ***\n\nThe ***A-****thru****-G* sequence** from Figure 10.11-1 represents *expected* ECG findings for ***\"typical\"* evolution** of ***acute* MI**. That said — *Many patients do not read the textbook\\!* Variations on the general “theme” depicted in Figure 10.11-1 are common. Consider the following:\n\n+ **Q waves** do *not* always develop \\(Caveat \\#1 — *in Section 10.6*\\). There may be *non-Q-wave* infarction. \n+ When *infarction* Q waves *do* form — they may become smaller or even *disappear* over time. \n+ ST depression *or* T wave inversion *alone* may at times be the *only* ECG change that is seen. The appearance of these changes does *not* always follow the sequence shown in Figure 10.11-1. \n+ *Acute* MI may develop in an area of the heart that is ***electrically* “silent”***. *For example — ECG changes may *not* always be seen \\(*or may be minimal*\\) when there is ***high lateral*** or ***apical* infarction**. *Special* leads may be needed to visualize ***acute* RV infarction** \\(*Section 10.31*\\). \n+ There may be **BBB** \\(*Bundle Branch Block*\\) or IVCD that was *either* present before or developed *as a result* of the acute MI. BBB may *mask* the ECG signs of acute or chronic infarction \\(*Sections 05.24 through 05.29*\\). \n+ There may be **acute *posterior* MI** — that produces a ***“STEMI-equivalent”*** pattern that manifests *anterior* ST *depression* rather than elevation \\(*Section 10.33*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.13 – *KEY *Points:* ECG Changes of Acute MI ***\n\n*Despite* the above cited potential variations in ECG presentation of acute *evolving* MI — awareness of the ***typical* sequence** shown in Figure 10.11-1 will go a long way toward optimally *rapid* recognition.\n\n+ Focus on ***ASAP *recognition** of **ST elevation** \\(*or stemi-equivalent*\\) patterns — since these are the patients who are *most* likely to benefit from ***acute* reperfusion** \\(*angioplasty/stenting*\\) of the occluded vessel. Even if positive troponins *later* confirm that infarction *did* occur — acute intervention is of limited \\(*if any*\\) benefit for *pain-controlled*, stable patients with *non*-STEMI \\(*Section 10.3* \\). \n+ Because ECG changes will *not* always be seen with *acute* MI and **troponins** may *initially* be *negative* — ***History ***becomes a *KEY* determinant for whether or not to admit a patient with chest pain to the hospital. As a general rule, IF at all in doubt — *Admit the *patient. \n+ Have a ***low* threshold** to ***Repeat ***the** ECG** — especially if the patient has *ongoing* chest pain or if you are *uncertain* about whether the *initial* ECG represents an *acute* event. An acute *evolving* infarction may show changes in *as little* as 20-40 minutes\\! \n+ *Acute* ECG changes may be subtle \\(*as in the hyperacute stage = ***Panel C*** in *Figure 10.11-1\\). Look especially for ***reciprocal* ST depression** in lead areas *not* showing ST elevation to determine IF ECG findings are *likely* to be acute. \n+ Use the concept of ***\"patterns of leads\"***. That is, if *uncertain* about whether a Q wave or T wave inversion in **lead III** or **aVF** is *clinically* significant — look at the ***other* inferior lead** \\(*which is ****lead II***\\). ECG changes in the *inferior* leads are much *more* likely to reflect ischemia/infarction IF present in *each* lead of the grouping \\(ie, *in II, III and aVF*\\). Similarly — chest lead abnormalities are more likely to reflect ischemia/infarction IF present in *more* than a single lead. \n+ Use ***Prior *Tracings** to **compare**. *Go lead-by-lead*. Look *not* only at ST-T waves, but *also* at the QRS in *each* lead \\(*since axis change *and/or *lead placement errors may both affect ST-T wave appearance*\\). \n+ **NOTE:** A ***change*** in **QRS axis** from baseline to current tracing may alter ST-T wave appearance \\(*as well as resulting in Q wave appearance or disappearance*\\). Similarly — a ***change*** in the area of **transition** from baseline to current tracing may alter QRST appearance in precordial leads *without* this indicating that there has been interval change. \n+ **PEARL:** When the ECG was done — ***Was the bed* flat?** If not — Note the *angle* of the bed when the ECG was recorded. Many patients are too sick to lie flat \\(*Q waves *and* ST-T changes may be produced by even small amounts of bed incline, especially in the inferior leads*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.14 – Assessing *Acute* ECG Changes **\n\nApply the concepts discussed in this section for assessing ***acute* ECG changes** to the tracing in **Figure 10.14-1** — obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain.\n\n+ Is there evidence of *acute* infarction? If so — Is this an *acute* STEMI? \n+ Are there *reciprocal* changes? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.14-1:** ECG from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. Is there evidence of an *acute* STEMI? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.14-1:** The rhythm is sinus. All intervals and the axis are normal. No chamber enlargement.\n\n+ **Q-R-S-T Changes:** There are large ***inferior* Q waves** \\(*in leads II,III,aVF*\\) — and *small* q waves in V5,V6. Transition occurs normally \\(*between V3-to-V4*\\) — but there is subtle ***loss of R wave*** from V2-to-V3. \n+ There is ***hyperacute* ST segment elevation** in leads III and aVF. By the concept of ***“patterns of leads”*** \\(ie, *simultaneously looking at all leads in a given lead group*\\) — there is probably *also* some ST elevation in lead II with ***reciprocal* changes** \\(*ST depression/T wave inversion*\\) in the *anterolateral* leads. \n\n \n\n***Clinical *Impression:** Sinus rhythm. **Acute *inferior* MI** \\(*as diagnosed by the presence of Q waves; ST elevation; reciprocal ST depression*\\). There is also probable **acute *posterior* MI** \\(*positive “mirror test” in V2,V3* — *See Section 10.33*\\).\n\n+ The *above-noted* changes in Figure 10.14-1 qualify as an **acute *inferior* STEMI** — as there is ST elevation associated with *acute* ECG changes in this patient with *new-onset* chest pain. That said — it is difficult to “date” this infarction, because ***inferior* Q waves** are already well established \\(*they are especially wide and deep in lead III*\\). Whether this is the result of *prior* inferior MI with *superimposed* new acute MI — vs *recent* inferior MI with *acute* extension — vs *rapid* evolution of a single *ongoing* event is uncertain. ***BOTTOM* Line:** *Clinical* implications are similar *regardless* of whether the ECG in Figure 10.14-1 represents *old-plus-new *MI vs *single* new MI — since the *combination* of ***new-onset* chest pain** plus ***acute* ECG changes** \\(*ST elevation; hyperacute T waves; reciprocal ST depression*\\) means that the patient may benefit from *acute* reperfusion. \n+ The phenomenon of ***Hyperacute* T waves** is well illustrated in Figure 10.14-1 by T wave appearance in **lead III** \\(*and to a lesser extent in lead aVF*\\). Note that the T wave in these leads looks disproportionately tall and wide given the presence of ST elevation. \n+ ***Reciprocal* ST depression** — is also well seen in Figure 10.14-1 in *multiple* leads. In particular — Note the ***mirror-image* appearance** of the ST-T wave in lead III *compared to* lead aVL. \n+ ***KEY *Point**: The presence of both *hyperacute* T waves and *reciprocal* ST depression in *multiple* leads combine to strongly suggest that *despite* surprisingly deep and wide inferior Q waves — the ECG picture in Figure 10.14-1 is likely to be acute. \n\n \n\n**10.15 – FIGURE 10.15-1: *Use of Serial ECGs in Acute STEMI ***\n\nThe ECG in Figure 10.15-1 was obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain and **obvious *acute* STEMI**. *Follow-up* ECGs on this patient are shown in **Figure 10.15-2** \\(*obtained a short while later*\\) — and finally in **Figure 10.15-3** \\(*obtained post-cath/reperfusion*\\).\n\n+ Is there *evolution* of the MI on these *serial* ECGs? \n+ Was acute *reperfusion* successful \\(Figure 10.15-3\\)? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.15-1:** This is **ECG \\#1** \\(***blue**** border*\\) — from this patient with *new-onset* chest pain. There is sinus bradycardia with marked *precordial* ST elevation. Q waves have *not* yet formed in the *anterior* leads on this ***initial* ECG \\#1**. Note the ***hyperacute*** appearance of **ST-T waves** in leads V2,V3,V4. Surprisingly — *reciprocal* changes are minimal \\(*no more than slight ST-T wave flattening/depression in the inferior leads*\\). Despite this — there can be *little doubt* that this **ECG \\#1** represents a **large *acute* STEMI** in evolution.\n\n**What is the *“Culprit”* Artery?:** We suspect acute ***proximal* LAD occlusion** as the *“culprit”* artery for the *acute* STEMI seen in Figure 10.15-1. As will be discussed in Section 10.25 — *proximal* LAD \\(*Left Anterior Descending*\\) occlusion is suggested by the ECG finding of *diffuse* precordial ST elevation that is especially *marked* in leads V2-to-V4.\n\n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Another finding in favor of acute *proximal* LAD occlusion is that ST elevation is *more* marked in lead V1 than in lead aVR. In contrast — ST elevation tends to be more marked in aVR compared to V1 when there is left main disease. \n+ **KEY *Clinical* Point:** This patient is an *ideal* candidate for acute reperfusion — because there is *marked* ST elevation in Figure 10.15-1, but *no* anterior Q waves have yet formed. *Activate the cath lab ASAP\\!* \n\n \n\nTwo ***follow-up* ECGs** to Figure 10.15-1 are shown below. For clarity — We use a *different* color border for each tracing:\n\n+ Figure 10.15-1 — **ECG \\#1** \\(***blue**** border*\\) = the ***initial* ECG** obtained at presentation. \n+ Figure 10.15-2 — **ECG \\#2** \\(***red**** border*\\) = obtained a short while after ECG \\#1. \n+ Figure 10.15-3 — **ECG \\#3** \\(***green**** border*\\) = obtained after acute cath and angioplasty/stenting of the acutely occluded LAD. \n\n \n\nAs you evaluate these ***serial* ECGs** — Keep in mind the ***following* Questions**:\n\n+ Is there ECG evidence of *evolution* on these *serial* ECGs? \n+ Was acute *reperfusion* successful \\(Figure 10.15-3\\)? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.15-2:** This is **ECG \\#2** \\(***red**** border*\\) — obtained a short while *after* ECG \\#1 from this patient with *acute* STEMI. Note that ***since* ECG \\#1** — there has been interim development of **RBBB** \\(*an rSr’ complex is now seen in V1 *with* wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6*\\). The appearance of **lead V2** is concerning — as the large ***new* Q wave** and now **T wave *inversion*** in this lead suggest ***ongoing* evolution** is in progress \\(*comparable to* **Panel F** *in* Figure 10.11-1\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.15-3:** This is **ECG \\#3** \\(***green**** border*\\) — obtained after acute catheterization and angioplasty/stenting of the acutely occluded LAD. The “good news” — is that this ***post-cath* ECG \\#3** is encouraging\\! Note that the QRS complex has *narrowed* and RBBB is *no longer* present. The **Q wave** seen earlier in lead V2 of ECG \\#2 has ***resolved*** — and ST-T waves have essentially returned to baseline. R wave progression is essentially normal \\(*with transition between V3-to-V4*\\). It appears that ***acute* reperfusion** has **salvaged *significant* myocardium\\!**\n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** Use of *serial* ECGs may be extremely valuable in following the course of *acute* MI. *Lead-to-lead* comparison of QRS morphology and ST-T wave changes facilitates determining *which* changes are new — as well as providing insight to the likely benefit obtained from *acute* intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.16 – The *Coronary* Circulation **\n\n\n\nThe most common cause of *acute* MI is **sudden *total* occlusion** of a **major *coronary* artery**. The area of the heart affected will depend on distribution to the area from the coronary circulation. In these next few sections — We briefly review **normal *coronary* anatomy** with the goal of assisting in *rapid* identification of the ***“culprit”* artery**.\n\n+ Prompt recognition of *acute* coronary occlusion with *rapid* initiation of ***reperfusion* therapy** is essential for optimal outcome. For this — evaluation of the ***initial* ECG** is invaluable. \n+ Appreciation of normal coronary anatomy and common variants facilitates the process. \n+ **NOTE:** Basic core material review of the coronary circulation is presented in Section 10.17. For those wanting *additional* material — More *advanced* aspects of the coronary circulation that extends *Beyond-the-Core* — is covered in Sections 10.18 *through* Section 10.21. \n\n \n\n**10.17 – *Overview of Normal Coronary Anatomy \u0026 Variants***\n\nIn Figure 10.17-1 — We present a *schematic* overview of *normal* coronary anatomy \\(**Panel A**\\). Two of the most important anatomic variants are shown in Panels B and C:\n\n+ The two major vessels supplying the heart are the right and left coronary arteries. These most commonly arise from the right and left aortic sinuses, respectively \\(Panel A\\). \n+ In ***most* patients** \\(*80-90%*\\) — the **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) is a ***dominant* vessel** that supplies the RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) — and then continues as the **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\) along the *undersurface* of the heart \\(*unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the RCA in* Panel A\\) to supply the *inferior* and *posterior* walls of the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\). Not shown — the **AV nodal artery** is most often supplied from the RCA. \n+ As suggested in Panel A of **Figure 10.17-1** — the **LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\) is typically a short vessel \\(*10mm*\\) that then ***bifurcates*** into the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) and the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Coronary Artery*\\). \n+ Normally *—*** **the **LAD** runs along the *anterior* epicardial surface of the heart in the interventricular groove on its path toward the cardiac apex. The **LAD** generally supplies: **i\\)** the *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*via its ****diagonal* branches**\\); **ii\\)** the *cardiac* apex; and **iii\\)** a major portion of the conduction system \\(*via ****septal* perforators*** that run vertically down through the septum*\\). \n+ The **LCx** \\(*Circumflex*\\) **Artery** *— *wraps around the *lateral* free wall of the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\). In most patients \\(ie, *when the RCA is dominant*\\) *— *the LCx becomes relatively *small* after giving rise to one or more ***obtuse* marginal branches** that supply the lateral free wall \\(*dotted vessels arising from the LCx in* Panel A\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.17-1:** Overview of *normal* coronary anatomy. **Panel A** *— *the most common situation \\(*80-90%*\\), in which the **RCA** is a *dominant* vessel that supplies the RV as well as the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the LV. The **LAD** normally supplies the *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*via diagonal branches*\\); part of the *cardiac* apex; and a major portion of the conduction system \\(*via septal perforators that run vertically down through the septum*\\). **Panel B** *—*** **represents a ***left-dominant*** circulation, in which the **LCx** \\(*rather than the RCA*\\) supplies the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the left ventricle. **Panel C** *—* represents an **LAD *“wrap-around”*** variant, in which the LAD also supplies part of the *inferior* wall as well as the *anterior* wall \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Common *Variants in* Normal *Coronary Anatomy:** Figure 10.17-1 is purely schematic. Realize that numerous variations exist on the most common picture of *normal* coronary anatomy that is shown in **Panel A**. These depend on *anatomic* differences and extent of disease \\(*development of collaterals*\\) — *plus* any revascularization that may have occurred.\n\n+ Anatomic appearance also depends greatly on ***projection* angle** for the ***basic* views** that are shown \\(ie, *septal perforator branches appear longer when viewed from a less superior angle*\\). \n+ Our discussion is limited to generalities. \n+ **Panel B** \\(*in* Figure 10.17-1\\) — represents a ***“left-dominant”* circulation**. This anatomic variant is seen in ~15% of patients. In such cases — the **RCA** is a ***smaller*** vessel than depicted in Panel A. To compensate — the **LCx** is typically ***larger*** and gives rise to the **PDA** \\(*large unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the LCx in* Panel B\\). In a *left-dominant* circulation — the ***inferior*** and/or ***posterior* wall** of the LV is supplied by the LCx. \n+ Clinically — the existence of a ***left-dominant* circulation** in ~15% of patients explains why *inferior* and *posterior* MIs will *not* always be due to acute RCA occlusion. Similarly, since the **AV nodal artery** may be supplied by the LCx in a *left-dominant* circulation — AV block may also occasionally occur with LCx \\(*rather than RCA*\\) occlusion. \n+ **Panel C** \\(*in* Figure 10.17-1\\) — represents a ***“wrap-around” *LAD** variant circulation. Occasionally — the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) is ***larger*** and ***longer***, to the point of *extending* beyond the cardiac apex and *“wrapping around”* to ***supply*** the **undersurface** of the heart \\(*dotted vessel extending underneath the apex from the LAD in* Panel C\\). In extreme cases — a *“wraparound”* LAD may even serve the function of the PDA. \n+ Clinically — Awareness of the possibility of a ***“wrap-around”* LAD** circulation as an anatomic variant may explain the occasional ECG pattern of *simultaneous* ST elevation in ***inferior*** and ***anterior* lead areas**. Not surprisingly —infarction the patient with a “wraparound” LAD variant may be quite large. *Beyond-the-Core:* Another reason for the occasional occurrence of *simultaneous* inferior and anterior ST elevation may be Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy \\(*See Section 10.61*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.18 – The RCA:* Taking a Closer Look***\n\nIn Figure 10.18-1 — We now take a *closer* look at normal \\(*expected*\\) coronary anatomy of the **RCA** \\(*Right-Coronary Artery*\\). We emphasize that this ***closer* look** at coronary anatomy constitutes ***advanced*** material for those wanting to know more. It is *Beyond-the-Core* for a basic ECG curriculum.\n\n+ As discussed in Section 10.17 — the **RCA** arises from the right anterior aortic sinus \\(**Figure 10.18-1**\\). The usual path of the RCA is along the right atrioventricular \\(AV\\) groove on its way to the **“crux”** \\(*= the point on the diaphragmatic surface where the anterior AV groove — posterior AV groove — *and* inferior interventricular groove all meet*\\). \n+ The 1st branch of the RCA is usually the ***conus* artery** which supplies the right ventricular outflow tract \\(*not shown on *Figure 10.18-1\\). \n+ The 2nd branch is usually the **SAN** \\(*SA Nodal artery*\\). Of note *—* the RCA supplies the SAN in ~60% of patients. In the remaining ~40% *—* the SAN arises *either* from the LCA or from *both* the RCA and LCA. *Beyond-the-Core:* Awareness of the fact that the SAN is most often supplied by the RCA *—* explains why ***atrial* infarction** is most often seen in the setting of acute *proximal* RCA occlusion \\(*in association with acute infero-postero *and* right ventricular stemi — See Section 09.35*\\). \n+ The ***midportion*** of the **RCA** gives off one or more **AM** \\(*Acute Marginal*\\)** branches** that supply the anterior wall of the RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\). On occasion *—* AM branches may provide collateral circulation to the anterior wall when the LAD is occluded. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.18-1:** Normal coronary anatomy of the **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) and its major branches. **Panel A** *— anterior* view. **Panel B** *—* RAO \\(*Right-Anterior Oblique*\\) view \\(*See text*\\). Abbreviations: **SAN** \\(*SA Nodal Artery*\\); **AM** \\(*Acute Marginal branches from the RCA*\\); **AVN** \\(*AV Nodal Artery*\\); **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\).\n\n***Additional* Notes on Figure 10.18-1:** In *most* patients \\(*80-90%*\\) *—* the **RCA** is a ***dominant* vessel** that continues after giving off one or more AM branches as the **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\) along the undersurface of the heart. The PDA supplies the ***posterior*** and ***inferior* walls** of the **LV** \\(*Left Ventricle*\\).\n\n+ The PDA also gives rise to a number of small inferior septal branches that travel *upward* to supply the lower septum, and which connect with septal branches traveling downward from the LAD \\(*not shown on* Fig. 10.18-1\\). \n+ On occasion *— *the **PDA** may also give rise to exceptionally large **PLA** \\(*Postero-Lateral Artery*\\) **branches** that extend laterally to supply parts of the LV free \\(*lateral*\\) wall. *Beyond-the-Core:* Awareness of the variant in which there may be large PLA branches arising from the PDA \\(*not shown on* Fig. 10.18-1\\) *—* explains why you may occasionally see acute *infero-postero-lateral* stemi \\(*with ST elevation in V5,V6*\\) from acute RCA *rather than* LCx occlusion \\(*See Section 10.40.5*\\). \n+ The **AVN** \\(*AV Nodal Artery*\\) is a branch of the RCA in about 2/3 of patients \\(Panel A *in* Figure 10.18-1\\). In the remainder of patients *—* the AVN arises from the LCA \\(*Left Coronary Artery*\\). \n+ Clinically *— *the reason AV Wenckebach \\(*Mobitz Type I 2nd-degree AV block*\\) is most commonly seen with acute *inferior* MI *— *is that that the AVN usually arises from the RCA. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core: *Mobitz I 2nd-degree AV block may occasionally be seen with acute LCx occlusion *—* in patients with a *left-dominant* circulation \\(*in which case the AVN is generally supplied by the dominant circumflex vessel*\\). \n+ Summary: ***Acute* occlusion** of the **RCA** *— *typically results in **acute *inferior* infarction**. Awareness of the most common anatomic RCA patterns provides insight to possible *associated* RV and *posterior* involvement — *as well as to* potential SA nodal and AV nodal conduction abnormalities. \n\n \n\n**10.19 – The LEFT Coronary Artery:* Taking a Closer Look***\n\nIn Figure 10.19-1 — We take a closer look at normal \\(*expected*\\) coronary anatomy of the **LCA** \\(*Left-Coronary Artery*\\).\n\n+ As discussed in Section 10.17 — the **LCA** arises from the left aortic sinus \\(**Figure 10.19-1**\\). This vessel begins as the **LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\), which is typically a short vessel \\(*10mm*\\) that then ***bifurcates*** into the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) and the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Coronary Artery*\\). \n+ Clinically — It is important to emphasize that ***acute* occlusion** of the **LMain** usually results in ***rapid* demise** of the patient \\(*since this generally leads to infarction of the entire left ventricle*\\). These patients typically die *before* reaching the hospital \\(*See Section 09.40*\\). \n\n \n\n***Major* Branches of the LAD:** The **LAD** \\(*Left-Anterior-Descending*\\)** Artery** runs along the anterior epicardial surface of the heart in the interventricular groove on its path toward the cardiac apex. The LAD generally supplies the *anterior* wall of the heart, the *cardiac* apex and a major portion of the conduction system.\n\n+ The ***major* branches** of the **LAD** are **i\\)** the ***S****eptal* perforator vessels; and **ii\\) *D****iagonal* branches. \n+ ***Septal* branch anatomy** is highly variable. We show 2 septal branches in Figure 10.19-1 \\(***S-1; S-2***\\) — but instead there may be only one septal branch or *many* septal branches, depending on individual anatomy. The **1st *septal* branch** is typically the largest; its takeoff is generally *just after* the takeoff of the 1st diagonal branch. \n+ The ***interventricular* septum** is the most densely vascularized area of the heart. This is as it should be given the integral role of the septum in providing blood supply to the heart’s conduction system. ***Septal* perforators** normally run a vertical path *downward* following their takeoff from the proximal LAD. \n+ *Downward* penetrating septal branches from the LAD typically connect with *upward* penetrating septal branches from the PDA branch of the RCA. In this way — there is usually a ***network*** of **collaterals** from *both* LCA and RCA systems in the event of disease in one system. How adequately collaterals from one system compensate for disease in the other is subject to individual variation \\(*as well as to how rapidly occlusive disease develops*\\). \n+ *Clinical* Note: Very ***proximal* LAD lesions** have been known as ***“widow-makers”***. Especially if proximal to the 1st septal perforator \\(*and the 1st diagonal branch*\\) *—* these lesions are virtual ***“left-main-equivalents”*** because of the extent of injury and conduction system damage they cause. \n+ ***Diagonal* branch anatomy** is also highly variable. We show 2 diagonal branches in Figure 10.19-1 \\(***D-1; D-2***\\) — but there may be 1, 2, or 3 diagonal branches supplying the *anterolateral* wall of the heart. Occasionally — there is *no* diagonal branch per se, but rather a discrete ***ramus* intermedius** arising from *between* the LAD and LCx to supply the anterolateral surface \\(*not shown on* Fig. 10.19-1\\). Typically — it is the **1st *diagonal* branch** that is the largest. \n+ *Clinical* Note Considerable variation in number and course of diagonal branch anatomy \\(*and the angulated path that these vessels follow*\\) may require multiple views on cath to determine if occlusion is present. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.19-1:** Normal coronary anatomy of the ***left* coronary artery** and its major branches. The LCA \\(*Left Coronary Artery*\\) begins as a short **LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\) branch *—* which then ***bifurcates*** into the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) and the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\). **Panel A** *— anterior* view. **Panel B** *—* RAO \\(*Right-Anterior Oblique*\\) view \\(*See text*\\). Abbreviations: **S-1**,**S-2** \\(*Septal Perforator branches*\\); **D-1**,**D-2** \\(*Diagonal branches*\\); **M-1**,**M-2** \\(*Obtuse Marginal branches from the LCx*\\).\n\n***Major* Branches of the LCx:** The **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex*\\)** Artery** is the other main branch of the LCA \\(Figure 10.19-1\\). In most \\(*80-90%*\\) patients *—* the LCx is limited in its course and primarily supplies the **lateral *free* wall** of the **LV**.\n\n+ After arising from the LMain *—* the **LCx** wraps around the lateral wall of the heart, and then typically runs in the left *posterior* atrioventricular groove in its path to the *infero-postero-interventricular* groove. \n+ The ***main* branches** of the **LCx** are the ***Obtuse* Marginals**. We show 2 *marginal* branches in Figure 10.19-1 \\(***M-1; M-2***\\) *—* but the usual number may vary from 1-to-3. In most patients *—* the LCx becomes relatively small after giving rise to its marginal branches. \n+ The ***marginals*** supply the **lateral *free* wall** of the** LV** \\(*Think “marginal” = “lateral” free wall*\\). \n+ *Clinical* Note Despite assessment of the ***lateral* wall** by *no less* than **5** of the 12 **leads** \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\) — the ***high-lateral* wall** may *not* be well visualized. This part of the LV is typically supplied by the **1st *Diagonal* branch** of the **LAD** \\(*and not by the LCx*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* The lateral leads that most consistently assess the part of the heart supplied by the LCx are leads V5,V6. Therefore — **ST elevation** in **V5,V6** most often suggests ***acute* LCx occlusion**. Exceptions — Some patients may have either large PLA \\(*Postero-Lateral Artery*\\) branches that arise from the RCA or they may have an *unusual* pattern of collateral circulation. *Otherwise* — acute ST elevation in V5,V6 = acute LCx occlusion. \n\n \n\nPEARL: **ST elevation** in **lead aVL** may provide an *invaluable* clue to the location of the acutely occluded coronary artery. According to a study by Birnbaum et al \\(*Am Heart J 131:38, 1996*\\):\n\n+ *Suspect* acute **LAD occlusion *proximal*** to the **1st Diagonal** if *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is *also* ST elevation in leads V2-through-V5. This is the most common situation when there is ST elevation in lead aVL. \n+ *Suspect* **1st *Diagonal* branch occlusion** if *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is ST elevation in lead V2 \\(*but not in V3,V4,V5*\\). \n+ *Suspect* occlusion of the **1st *Obtuse Marginal* branch** of the** LCx** if *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is ST depression in lead V2. \n+ **NOTE:** *Anterior* ST elevation *without* ST elevation in aVL — suggests LAD occlusion *after* takeoff of the 1st Diagonal \\(= *D-1 in* Figure 10.19-1\\). \n\n \n\n**10.20 – LEFT-Dominant Circulation:* Taking a Closer Look***\n\nApproximately 15% of patients have a ***“left-dominant” *circulation**. In such cases *—* the RCA is a *smaller* vessel, terminating before it reaches the crux. To compensate *—* the **LCx** is ***larger*** and ***gives rise*** to the **PDA** \\(Figure 10.20-1\\).\n\n+ Clinically — Awareness of the *left-dominant* anatomic variant accounts for the occurrence of most *infero-postero-lateral* infarction patterns. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* As noted in Section 10.18-1 — patients with a *left-dominant* circulation and *acute* LCx occlusion may manifest Mobitz I 2nd-degree AV block \\(*because the AV Nodal artery is usually supplied by the LCx when this vessel is dominant*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.20-1:** *Schematic* depiction of a ***left-dominant* circulation** \\(*10-20% of patients*\\). The **RCA** is a *smaller* vessel. To compensate *—* the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Coronary Artery*\\) is much ***larger*** and longer \\(*Compare to* Figure 10.18-1\\). **Panel A** *— anterior* view. **Panel B** *—* RAO \\(*Right-Anterior Oblique*\\) view \\(*See text*\\). Abbreviations: **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\); **SAN** \\(*SA Nodal Artery*\\); **AM** \\(*Acute Marginal branches from the RCA*\\); **AVN** \\(*AV Nodal Artery*\\); **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\); **S-1**,**S-2** \\(*Septal Perforator branches*\\); **D-1**,**D-2** \\(*Diagonal branches*\\); **M-1**,**M-2** \\(*Obtuse Marginal branches from the LCx*\\).\n\n**10.21 – LAD “Wrap-Around”:* Taking a Closer Look***\n\nIn Section 10.18 — We discussed and illustrated the usual distribution of the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\). Normally, the LAD supplies the *anterior* wall of the heart and the *cardiac* apex. Nevertheless, like *other* major coronary vessels — the LAD is *also* subject to individual variation in its size, course, and the areas of the heart that it vascularizes.\n\n+ In some patients — the LAD may terminate *prior* to attaining the apex. In such cases — the apex will be supplied by a larger and ***longer-than-usual* PDA** arising from *either* a very dominant RCA — or from a *dominant* LCx vessel \\(Figure 10.20-1\\). \n+ Occasionally — the **LAD** will be a larger and longer vessel, to the point of extending *beyond* the cardiac apex and*** “wrapping around”*** to supply the *undersurface* of the heart \\(**Figure 10.21-1**\\). At times this extension of the LAD may even serve the function of the PDA. This variant is known as an **LAD *“wrap-around”***. \n+ *Clinical* Note Awareness of the possibility of *acute* LAD occlusion in a patient with this anatomic variant \\(ie, *an acute* ***“wraparound”* LAD lesion**\\) *—*** **explains the ECG pattern of ***simultaneous* ST elevation** in ***inferior*** and ***anterior* lead areas**. Obviously, such infarctions are extensive. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* It is often difficult to assess **acute *apical* infarction** by ECG *—* since this area of the heart may *not* be optimally viewed by the standard 12 leads. At other times *—* notation of *simultaneous* ST elevation in *inferior* and *anterior* leads may suggest acute *apical* involvement. Appreciation of the potential for LAD anatomic variation provides insight to the various ECG patterns that may be seen. NOTE: *Other* reasons that may account for *simultaneous* inferior *and* anterior ST elevation include: **i\\)** *proximal* RCA occlusion; and **ii\\)** Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy \\(*Section 10.61*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.21-1:** *Schematic* depiction of a ***“wrap around”* LAD** as an anatomic variant. The **RCA** is a *smaller* vessel. To compensate *—* **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) will *“wrap around”* the apex to supply the inferior LV wall \\(*Compare to* Figure 10.19-1\\). **Panel A** *— anterior* view. **Panel B** *—* RAO \\(*Right-Anterior Oblique*\\) view \\(*See text*\\). Abbreviations: **SAN** \\(*SA Nodal Artery*\\); **AM** \\(*Acute Marginal branches from the RCA*\\); **AVN** \\(*AV Nodal Artery*\\); **S-1**,**S-2** \\(*Septal Perforator branches*\\); **D-1**,**D-2** \\(*Diagonal branches*\\); **M-1**,**M-2** \\(*Obtuse Marginal branches from the LCx*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.22 – Identifying the *“Culprit”* Artery**\n\n\n\nAssessment of ***initial*** \\(*and serial*\\)** ECGs** during the *early* course of **ACS** \\(*Acute Coronary Syndromes*\\) may not only suggest the presence of acute \\(*or impending*\\) occlusion — but also indicate: **i\\)** the probable ***“culprit”* vessel** that is acutely occluded; **ii\\)** the location \\(*and extent*\\) of *evolving* injury; **iii\\)** associated arrhythmias *and* conduction disturbances; and **iv\\)** the *likelihood* that ***acute* reperfusion** will benefit the patient. The importance of *promptly* assessing the ***initial* ECG** in a patient with *new-onset* chest pain has *never* been greater.\n\n+ ***KEY* Point:** The ***amount*** of **benefit** that a patient is likely to derive from *acute* reperfusion of the **“culprit”** \\(= *infarct-related*\\) **artery** is *relative* and depends on both **size** *and* **acuity** of the infarct. The *more* ST deviation seen \\(ie, *marked ST elevation *and* reciprocal depression occurring in many leads*\\) without yet forming large Q waves — the *more* the *potential* for benefit. \n\n \n\nIn these next few sections — We review the ***expected* ECG picture** for ***acute* occlusion** of *each* of the major coronary vessels. These include:\n\n+ *Acute* **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) **occlusion** — *Section 10.23*. \n+ *Acute* **LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\) **occlusion** — *Section 10.24*. \n+ *Acute* **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) **occlusion** — *Section 10.25.* \n+ *Acute* **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\) **occlusion** — *Section 10.28.* \n\n \n\n**Suggestion:** Feel free to refer back to review of the ***Coronary* Circulation** \\(*in Sections 10.16 through 10.21*\\) — as you contemplate the *expected* ECG picture for *each* of the above entities.\n\n**10.23 – *Acute* RCA Occlusion**\n\nAs we discussed in Section 10.17 — the **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) serves as a ***dominant* vessel** in **~85%** of patients with a normal coronary circulation. This anatomic picture is *schematically* illustrated in **Panel A** of Figure 10.23-1 — in which the RCA can be seen to supply the RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) before transitioning to the **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\). The PDA then continues along the *undersurface* of the heart as it supplies the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the left ventricle \\(*unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the RCA in* Panel A\\). Thus, the **RCA** \\(*and its branches*\\) — will normally supply the right ventricle and inferior *plus* posterior walls of the left ventricle.\n\n+ In contrast to this picture of a *right-dominant* circulation in Panel A — the remaining **~15%** of patients have a ***left-dominant* circulation**. In this case — it is the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\) rather than the RCA that supplies the posterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle \\(**Panel B**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.23-1:** Comparison of a *right-dominant* circulation \\(**Panel A**\\) *— *which is the most common situation \\(~*85% of patients*\\) vs a ***left-dominant*** circulation \\(**Panel B**\\) *—* in which the LCx \\(*rather than the RCA*\\) supplies the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the left ventricle \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.17-1\\).\n\n**ECG findings** arising from ***acute* RCA occlusion** will vary depending on: **i\\)** Whether the patient has a *dominant* right or left circulation; **ii\\)** The relative *site* of occlusion within the RCA \\(ie, *proximal or more distal occlusion*\\); **iii\\)** Any *prior* infarctions that may have occurred; and **iv\\)** The status of the *collateral* circulation. For simplicity — We describe *expected* ECG findings assuming *no* prior infarctions and *no* alteration in collateral circulation.\n\n+ In the 80-90% of patients with a *right-dominant* circulation \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 10.23-1\\) — the most typical manifestation of ***acute* RCA occlusion** is ST elevation in all 3 *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) = **acute *inferior* MI**. \n+ ***Acute* RV** \\(*Right Ventricular*\\)** MI** — is likely to be seen when there is *proximal* RCA occlusion \\(*Section 10.18*\\). More distal RCA occlusion may spare much of the right ventricle. \n+ PEARL: ***Proximal* RCA occlusion** is suggested when **ST elevation** in **lead III** is ***more*** than in lead II \\(*especially if there is ****marked* ST depression*** in ***lead aVL**\\). This picture is seen in **Figure 10.23-2**. In contrast — a *left-dominant* LCx occlusion is suspected when there is *inferior* MI with *less* ST elevation in lead III and *less* ST depression in lead aVL \\(*especially if there is significant ST elevation in leads V5,V6*\\). \n+ ***Posterior* MI** — is commonly seen with RCA occlusion \\(*because the RCA most often supplies both inferior *and* posterior walls of the LV*\\). Posterior MI may *also* be seen with LCx occlusion IF there is a *left-dominant* circulation \\(*Section 10.17*\\). In *either* case — there will *usually* be ECG evidence of ***inferior* MI** when there is ***posterior* MI**. NOTE: The converse is *not* necessarily true — in that there may be acute inferior MI *without* associated posterior MI. *Beyond-the-Core:* Rarely — *isolated* posterior MI may occur \\(*if the occluded artery is at the level of the PDA*\\). ***Bottom* Line:** We look for associated acute *posterior* MI when we see ECG evidence of acute *inferior* MI. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.23-2:** Acute *infero-postero* MI from **acute *proximal* RCA occlusion**. Note ST elevation in lead III \u003e II with marked *reciprocal* ST depression in lead aVL. *Posterior* involvement is suggested by the ST depression in lead V2 \\(*positive “mirror” test*\\). There may also be acute RV involvement \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Additional Points regarding Acute RCA Occlusion:** Keeping in mind the areas of the heart most commonly supplied by the RCA facilitates recognizing acute occlusion of this vessel \\(Figure 10.23-2\\):\n\n+ **Lead III** is more rightward \\(*at \\+120 degrees*\\) than **lead II** \\(*at \\+60 degrees*\\). As a result — acute occlusion of the RCA generally produces ***more* ST elevation** in **lead III** than in lead II \\(Fig. 10.23-2\\). \n+ The electrical perspective of lead aVL is virtually *opposite* that of lead III. As a result — the *shape* of the ***reciprocal* ST depression** in **Lead aVL** often looks like the ***mirror-image*** of the ST elevation in **lead III**. ST-T wave changes in aVL are typically *marked* when there is *proximal* RCA occlusion — and are generally more prominent than in lead I. \n+ ***Posterior* MI** is suggested in Figure 10.23-2 — because of the *positive* “Mirror Test” for lead V2 \\(ie, *flipping lead V2 over would result in a Q wave with slight-but-real hyperacute ST elevation in this lead*\\). We discuss the ***“Mirror”* Test** in more detail beginning in Section 10.33. \n+ **NOTE:** Associated *posterior* MI may be seen when acute *inferior* MI results from *either* RCA occlusion or a *left-dominant *LCx occlusion. However, associated ***acute* RV** \\(*Right Ventricular*\\) **MI** localizes the “culprit artery” to the **RCA** — because the right ventricle is not supplied by the LCx \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\). We discuss use of ***right-sided* leads** and the ECG diagnosis of ***acute* RV MI** in Sections 10.31 and 10.32. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* We suspect that there may also be associated ***acute* RV MI** in Figure 10.23-2 — because the ST-T wave in lead V1 is relatively flat. Normally, with acute *posterior* MI — there is *similar-appearing* ST-T wave depression in *each* of the anterior leads \\(*V1,V2,V3*\\). In contrast, when there is *also* acute RV MI — *right-sided *ST elevation in lead V1 *cancels out* some of the ST depression that would have been seen from the *posterior* infarction. ***Bottom* Line:** Suspect associated ***acute* RV MI** with acute *infero-postero* MI from *proximal* RCA occlusion — IF you see ST segment coving with slight ST elevation in lead V1. The finding of a flat \\(*instead of depressed*\\) ST segment in lead V1 \\(*as is seen in* Figure 10.23-2\\) — suggests that there may be some canceling out of V1 ST depression by acute RV ST elevation. IF important to know — ***right-sided* leads** would help answer this question \\(*Section 10.31*\\). \n+ *Clinical* Note It is well to remember that **2nd-degree AV Block, Mobitz Type I** \\(*Section 02.72*\\) — is most often seen in association with *acute* RCA occlusion \\(*since the RCA usually supplies the AV nodal artery*\\). That said — Mobitz I may occasionally be seen with acute LCx occlusion of a *left-dominant* circulation \\(*in which case the AV nodal artery will usually be supplied by the LCx*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.24 – *Acute* LMain Occlusion**\n\nAs emphasized in Section 09.40 — Most patients with ***acute* LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\) **occlusion** do *not* survive. As a result — this entity is *not* often seen and *unlikely* to be appreciated clinically. Rapid deterioration with patient demise due to cardiogenic shock is the usual result *unless* acute LMain occlusion can be *immediately* recognized and *immediately* acted on.\n\n+ In those *rare* instances when ***acute* LMain occlusion** is captured on ECG — rather than the picture of *diffuse* ST depression that is characteristic of *severe* LMain disease \\(*Section 09.40*\\) — there should be **diffuse *precordial* ST *elevation*** in association with **ST *elevation*** in **lead aVR** \\(Figure 10.24-1\\). \n\n \n\n**PEARL:** Distinction between *acute* LMain vs *proximal* LAD occlusion may be suggested on ECG by the ***relative* amount** of **ST elevation** seen in **lead aVR** *compared to* **lead V1**.\n\n+ Think ***LMain* occlusion** — when ST elevation in lead aVR \u003e V1. \n+ Think ***proximal* LAD occlusion** — when ST elevation in lead V1 \u003e aVR. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.24-1:** ECG from an acutely decompensating patient with *new-onset* chest pain \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.40-2\\). New *bifascicular* block \\(*LAHB/RBBB*\\) in context with *dramatic* ST-T wave changes seen here \\(*including* **ST elevation** *in* **lead aVR** *and in lead V1*\\) — suggest acute occlusion of *either* the *proximal* LAD or the LMain coronary artery. Given that ST elevation in lead aVR is *at least as much* as in lead V1 \\(*red arrows*\\) — We *suspect* acute LMain occlusion \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Remember** — Most patients with acute LMain occlusion die *before* they reach the hospital. It will therefore be *rare* indeed that you have occasion to evaluate the ECG of such patients. In such rare instances — the clinical presentation will usually be obvious: an *acutely* ill patient with cardiac decompensation from *impending* cardiogenic shock.\n\n+ The **ECG** in **Figure 10.24-1** highlights what to look for: **i\\)** Conduction defects \\(*such as RBBB/LAHB that is seen here*\\); **ii\\)** *Marked* ST elevation in precordial leads \\(*and often also in lead aVL*\\); **iii\\)** Marked *reciprocal* ST depression in *other* lead areas; and **iv\\)** ST elevation in lead aVR that is *at least* as much \\(*if not more*\\) than the ST elevation in lead V1. \n\n \n\n**10.25 – *Acute* LAD Occlusion**\n\nAs discussed in Section 10.17 — the **LMain** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\) is typically a short vessel \\(*10mm*\\) that then ***bifurcates*** into the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) and the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Coronary Artery*\\). This anatomic picture is *schematically* illustrated in **Panel A** of Figure 10.25-1 — in which the **LAD** can be seen to run along the *anterior* epicardial surface of the heart on its path toward the cardiac apex.\n\n+ The **LAD** generally supplies:** i\\)** the *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*via its ****diagonal* branches**\\); **ii\\)** the cardiac apex; and **iii\\)** a major portion of the conduction system \\(*via ****septal* perforators*** that run vertically down through the septum*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.25-1:** Comparison of normal LAD circulation \\(**Panel A**\\) *—* vs LAD circulation with a ***“wrap-around”*** variant \\(**Panel B**\\). In this latter situation *—* the **RCA** is a *smaller* vessel. To compensate *— *the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) will *“wrap around”* the apex to supply the *inferior* as well as *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.17-1\\).\n\n**ECG findings** arising from ***acute* LAD occlusion** may vary depending on: **i\\)** The relative *site* of occlusion within the LAD \\(ie, *proximal to septal perforators and the 1st diagonal *or* more distal occlusion*\\); **ii\\)** Any *prior* infarctions that may have occurred; **iii\\)** Presence of any anatomic variants \\(*such as a “wrap-around” LAD circulation*\\); and **iv\\)** The status of the *collateral* circulation. For simplicity — We describe *expected* ECG findings in this Section 10.25 assuming *no* prior infarctions; *no* alteration in collateral circulation; and *no* anatomic variants.\n\n+ In **Section 10.26** — We put forth a ***reminder*** that *not* all that elevates ST segments in the *anterior* leads is *anterior* infarction. \n+ In **Section 10.27** — We discuss the ECG picture of *acute* LAD occlusion when there is an **LAD* “wrap-around”*** variant \\(Panel B\\). \n\n \n\n***Acute* LAD occlusion** leads to **acute *anterior* MI**. This may be extensive and also involve the *lateral* wall.\n\n+ The most typical ECG manifestation of *acute* LAD occlusion is **ST elevation** in ***anterior* leads** \\(*usually in ≥2 leads between V1-to-V4*\\). \n\n \n\nPEARL: **ST elevation** in **lead aVL** — may provide an *invaluable* clue to the location of the acutely occluded coronary artery. According to a study by Birnbaum et al \\(*Am Heart J 131:38, 1996*\\):\n\n+ *Suspect* acute **LAD occlusion *proximal*** to the **1st Diagonal** IF *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is *also* ST elevation in leads V2-through-V5. This is the most common situation when there is ST elevation in lead aVL. \n+ *Suspect* **1st *Diagonal* branch occlusion** IF *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is ST elevation in lead V2 \\(*but not in V3,V4,V5*\\). \n+ *Suspect* **LCx occlusion** \\(*especially of the* **1st obtuse *marginal* branch**\\) — IF there is ST elevation in aVL but *not* in lead V2 \\(*and not in other anterior leads*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** *Anterior* ST elevation ***without* ST elevation** in **lead aVL** — suggests more *distal* LAD occlusion *after* takeoff of the 1st Diagonal.\n\n+ **PEARL:** In addition to recognizing ST elevation in lead aVL *with* marked *anterior* ST elevation — there are 2 *additional* ways to identify patients at ***high* risk** of impending ***proximal* LAD occlusion**. These are:** i\\)** Recognition of ***Wellens’* Syndrome** \\(*Section 10.54*\\); and **ii\\)** Recognition of ***DeWinter* T Waves** \\(*Section 10.57*\\). \n\n \n\nApply these concepts to the ECG shown in **Figure 10.25-2** — obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. There is obvious evidence of a **large acute *anterior* STEMI** \\(*marked anterior ST elevation*\\).\n\n+ Is the ECG in Figure 10.25-2 likely to indicate *acute* LMain occlusion — or is the ***“culprit”* artery** more likely to be the LAD? \n+ If you suspect *acute* LAD occlusion — Is the occlusion more likely to be *proximal* or *distal* LAD in location? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.25-2:** ECG obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. An obvious acute *anterior* STEMI is present. What is the likely “culprit” artery? Is the lesion likely to be proximal or distal? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.25-2:** The rhythm is sinus. The most remarkable finding on this ECG is the *marked* ST elevation in leads V1-through-V5. There is also ST elevation in lead aVL. Subtle ST depression is present in the inferior leads as a *reciprocal* change.\n\n+ This ECG and the clinical picture is ***not*** suggestive of ***acute* LMain occlusion** because: **i\\)** Acute LMain occlusion is rare. Most patients die *before* reaching the hospital; and **ii\\) ST elevation** is ***marked*** in **lead V1** and *absent* in lead aVR. This strongly suggests occlusion of the LAD and *not* the LMain \\(*Section 10.24*\\). \n+ We strongly suspect **acute *proximal* LAD occlusion** for the ECG picture shown in Figure 10.25-2. This is because: **i\\)** Anterior ST elevation is extensive and *marked* in amount; **ii\\)** There is *significant* **ST elevation** in **lead aVL**; and **iii\\)** ST elevation is significant in **lead V1** and *absent* in lead aVR. \n\n \n\n***Additional* Clinical Notes Regarding *Proximal* LAD Occlusion:** As noted earlier — the *major* branches of the LAD are: **i\\)** the ***septal* perforators**; and **ii\\)** one or more ***diagonal* branches**.\n\n+ Patients with acute *proximal* LAD occlusion \\(*that occurs before takeoff of the 1st septal perforator*\\) — are at high risk of conduction system damage \\(*Mobitz II 2nd-degree AV block; anterior or posterior hemiblock; BBB*\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* In addition to the ECG signs of ST elevation in lead aVL and ST elevation in lead V1 \u003e aVR — the finding of ***new* RBBB** \\(*especially if a ***QR pattern*** is seen in lead V1 instead of an rSR’ pattern*\\) — makes it extremely likely that there is significant septal damage. \n+ NOTE: In many ways — a very *proximal* LAD lesion is almost a ***“left-main equivalent”***, in that extent of myocardial damage is *large* and risk of conduction system involvement is high. Acute *proximal* LAD occlusion has been known as a ***“widow-maker” *lesion** — because of the understandably *high mortality* associated with this event. This explains the ***urgency*** of **recognizing** the *uncommon* but *foreboding* ECG signs of *Wellens’* syndrome \\(*Section 10.54*\\) and — *DeWinter* T waves \\(*Section 10.57*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.26 – *Anterior* ST Elevation:* Not Always an Anterior MI***\n\nIn the interest of clinical relevance — We feel it important to issue a ***reminder*** that the ECG finding of ***anterior* ST elevation** is *not* always due to acute *anterior* STEMI. ***Other* Causes** of *anterior* ST elevation that may need to be considered include: **i\\)** *Early* repolarization \\(*discussed in detail in Section 09.19 and Section 09.23*\\);** ii\\)** Pericarditis **iii\\)** LVH \\(*See below in* **Figure 10.26-1**\\); **iv\\)** LBBB; **v\\)** Takotsubo; and **vi\\)** LV aneurysm.\n\n+ ***Clinical* correlation** and comparison with *prior* tracings may sometimes be needed to distinguish such patterns from acute injury. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.26-1:** ECG obtained from a patient with longstanding hypertension — illustrating **ST elevation *not* due to *acute* MI** \\(*reproduced from* Figure 08.9-2\\). IF this patient were to be having “chest pain” at the time this ECG was recorded — it might be easy to misinterpret the several millimeters of ST elevation in leads V2,V3 as indicative of a new event. That said — it is far more likely that the ***anterior* ST elevation** seen in the *blow-up* insert is an **infarct *“mimic”*** and merely reflects the *reciprocal* of the LV “strain” pattern seen in lead V6 because:** i\\)** the dramatic increase in QRS amplitude and typical *“strain”* ST-T wave morphology in lead V6 *“shouts out”* that the patient has **LVH** and *not* an MI; **ii\\)** ST elevation is essentially *limited* to 2 leads; and** iii\\)** the *shape* of ST elevation in leads V2,V3 is concave up and the *mirror-image* reciprocal of ST-T wave depression in V6 \\(*vs ST coving that would be more characteristic of acute injury*\\). That said — it may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between simple LVH vs LVH with *superimposed* acute ST elevation.\n\n**10.27 – *Acute* Occlusion of an LAD “Wrap-Around”**\n\nIn Sections 10.17 and 10.25 — We discussed normal coronary anatomy of the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\). This anatomic picture is *schematically* illustrated again in **Panel A** of Figure 10.27-1 — in which the **LAD** is seen passing along the *anterior* epicardial surface of the heart on its path toward the cardiac apex.\n\n+ The **LAD** typically supplies:** i\\)** the *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*via its ****diagonal* branches**\\); **ii\\)** the cardiac apex; and **iii\\)** a major portion of the conduction system \\(*via ****septal* perforators*** that run vertically down through the septum*\\). \n+ Approximately **5-10%** of normal subjects have an anatomic ***“wrap-around” *LAD** variant circulation \\(**Panel B**\\). In such cases — the **LAD** is a ***larger*** and ***longer*** vessel, to the point of *extending* beyond the cardiac apex and *“wrapping around”* to ***supply*** the **undersurface** of the heart \\(*dotted vessel extending underneath the apex from the LAD in* **Panel B** *of* Figure 10.27-1\\). In patients with this anatomic variant — the LAD provides the principal blood supply to *both* anterior and *inferior* walls of the heart. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.27-1:** Comparison of normal LAD circulation \\(**Panel A**\\) *—* vs LAD circulation with a ***“wrap-around”*** variant \\(**Panel B**\\). In this latter situation \\(*which is seen in ~5-10% of normal subjects*\\) *—* the **RCA** is a *smaller* vessel. To compensate *— *the **LAD** \\(*Left Anterior Descending Artery*\\) will *“wrap around”* the apex to supply the *inferior* as well as *anterior* wall of the heart \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.25-1\\).\n\nAn ECG picture that has at times been confusing is ***simultaneous*** presence of ***acute* ST elevation** in both ***anterior*** and ***inferior* leads**. This is because one normally associates acute *inferior* ST elevation with RCA occlusion — whereas acute *anterior* ST elevation is associated with LAD occlusion. A study by Sadanandan et al \\(*Am Heart J 146:653-661, 2003*\\) provides insight to *anatomic* explanation of this *unexpected* ECG finding. We integrate findings from the Sandanandan study while emphasizing the following *clinical* points:\n\n+ *Approximately* 15% of patients with acute ***anterior* ST elevation** *also* manifest ***inferior* ST elevation**. \n+ Surprisingly — about *half* of these patients with acute *anterior* and *inferior* ST elevation are found on cath to have ***proximal* RCA** *rather than* LAD occlusion as the “culprit” artery. Presumably — this is a result of RCA marginal branches extending over to supply part of the anterior wall or some other collateralization pattern \\(*Section 10.18*\\). \n+ **ECG Clues** suggesting the ***“culprit artery”*** is the ***proximal* RCA** *rather than *a wrap-around LAD are:** i\\)** ST elevation in **lead III \u003e** lead II; **ii\\)** ST elevation in lead V1 \u003e lead V3 \\(*as one would expect if there was acute RV involvement*\\); and **iii\\)** Lack of progression of ST elevation as one moves from lead V1-to-V4 \\(*with LAD occlusion ST elevation tends to become more by leads V3,V4*\\). \n+ In contrast — a ***“wrap-around” *LAD** should be suspected as the ***“culprit artery”*** IF:** i\\)** ST elevation in **lead II \u003e** lead III; **ii\\)** There is only *minimal* ST elevation in lead V1; and **iii\\)** There is *progressive *and *persistent* ST elevation as one moves from lead V1 *toward* leads V3,V4 \\(**Figure 10.27-2**\\). \n+ Surprisingly — patients with *anterior* STEMI from acute occlusion of a *“wrap-around”* LAD do *not* necessarily have large infarctions. This is because the site of acute occlusion is *not* necessarily proximal, but may instead be in the mid- or distal-LAD. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Another entity to consider for the presence of acute *simultaneous* inferior and anterior ST elevation is Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy — which may produce an ECG picture *similar* to that shown in *schematic* Figure 10.27-2. Cardiac catheterization is sometimes needed to make this diagnosis \\(*See Section 10.61*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.27-2:** *Schematic* ECG with *both* ***inferior*** and ***anterior* ST elevation** in a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. The “culprit artery” could be *either* a *proximal* RCA or *wraparound* LAD lesion. That said — 3 clues that the ***“culprit”* artery** is a ***‘wraparound’ *LAD** in this case are: **i\\)** ST elevation in lead III is *less* than in lead II; **ii\\)** ST elevation in V1 is minimal; and **iii\\)** ST elevation *progresses *and* persists* as one moves from V1 *toward* V3,V4 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**10.28 – *Acute* LCx \\(*Left Circumflex*\\) Occlusion**\n\nAs emphasized in Section 10.23 — in *most* subjects \\(*~****85%**** of the population*\\) the **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) is a ***dominant* vessel**. As such — the RCA normally supplies the RV \\(*Right Ventricle*\\) on its way as it transitions to the **PDA** \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\). The PDA then continues along the *undersurface* of the heart as it supplies the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the left ventricle \\(*unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the RCA in* **Panel A** *of* Figure 10.28-1\\).\n\n+ The **LCx** \\(*Circumflex*\\) **Artery** *— *wraps around the *lateral* free wall of the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\). In most patients \\(ie, *when the RCA is dominant*\\) *— *the LCx becomes a relatively *small* vessel after giving rise to one or more ***obtuse* marginal branches** that supply the lateral free wall \\(*dotted vessels arising from the LCx in* Panel A\\). \n+ In contrast to the situation in Panel A \\(*in which the RCA is dominant*\\) — between **10-20%** of patients have a ***left-dominant* circulation** \\(Panel B\\). In this case — the RCA is a *smaller* vessel. To compensate — the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\) is ***larger*** and gives rise to the **PDA** \\(*large unlabeled dotted vessel arising from the LCx in *Panel B\\). In a ***left-dominant* circulation** the *inferior* and/or *posterior* wall of the LV is supplied by the LCx \\(**Panel B**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.28-1:** Comparison of a *right-dominant* circulation \\(**Panel A**\\) *— *which is the most common situation \\(~*85% of patients*\\) vs a ***left-dominant*** circulation \\(**Panel B**\\) *—* in which the LCx \\(*rather than the RCA*\\) supplies the *posterior* and *inferior* walls of the left ventricle \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.23-1\\).\n\n**ECG findings** arising from ***acute* LCx occlusion** will vary depending on: **i\\)** Whether the patient has a *dominant* right or left circulation; **ii\\)** The relative *site* of occlusion within the LCx \\(ie, *proximal or more distal occlusion*\\); **iii\\)** Any *prior* infarctions that may have occurred; and **iv\\)** The status of the *collateral* circulation. For simplicity — We describe *expected* ECG findings assuming *no* prior infarctions and *no* alteration in collateral circulation.\n\n+ ***Acute* occlusion** of the **Circumflex** \\(*LCx*\\) **artery** leads to ***lateral* MI**. This is manifest on ECG by ST elevation in one or more of the *lateral* leads. \n+ Despite assessment of the **LV *lateral* wall** by *no less* than **5** of the 12 **leads** \\(*I,aVL; V4,V5,V6*\\) — the ***high-lateral* wall** may *not* be well visualized. This part of the LV is typically supplied by the **1st *Diagonal* branch** of the **LAD** \\(*and not by the LCx*\\). Thus — **Lead aVL** really provides more information about the site of LAD occlusion \\(*proximal or distal to the 1st Diagonal branch*\\) than it does about the LCx \\(*Section 10.25*\\). \n+ The other *“high-lateral”* lead — is **Lead I**. In general — lead I provides *little* independent information regarding the site of acute occlusion. It may be best to think of lead I as providing a *similar* electrical viewpoint as lead aVL, albeit ECG changes in lead I are usually less prominent than in aVL. \n+ The ***lateral* leads** that most consistently assess the part of the heart supplied by the LCx are leads V5,V6. Therefore — **ST elevation** in **leads V5,V6** most often suggests ***acute* LCx occlusion**. *Neighboring* **lead V4** may manifest similar findings as V5,V6 — but by itself is of *little* help in localizing the site of acute occlusion. \n+ **NOTE:** Exceptions exist in which ST elevation in leads V5,V6 may *not* necessarily indicate LCx occlusion. This may occasionally occur in patients with large PLA \\(*Postero-Lateral Artery*\\) branches that arise from the PDA branch of the RCA and supply the lateral wall or in patients with an *unusual* pattern of collateral circulation. ***Otherwise*** — acute **ST elevation** in leads **V5,V6** = ***acute* LCx occlusion**. \n\n \n\n*Clinical* Synthesis IF there is **ST elevation** in ***“high-lateral” *leads** \\(ie, **lead I** *and/or* **lead aVL**\\) — but there is *no* ST elevation in any of the lateral *precordial* leads \\(*V4,V5,V6*\\) — the site of ***acute* occlusion** is probably in the **LAD**. This premise will be supported by the presence of ST elevation in one or more of the *anterior* leads \\(*Section 10.25*\\).\n\n+ IF on the *other* hand, there is ST elevation in lead I *and/or* aVL and ST elevation in lateral *precordial* leads \\(*V4,V5,V6*\\) but *not* in any *anterior* leads — then ***acute* LCx occlusion** is the likely “culprit” artery. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Recently — MRI correlations with cardiac anatomy, coronary artery distribution, and ECG findings suggest that traditional ECG terminology is *not* as accurate as previously thought \\(*Bayes de Luna et al: Circulation 114:1755, 2006*\\). Therefore — acute ECG changes *isolated* to the ***“high-lateral”* leads** \\(= *leads I,aVL*\\) — appear to more accurately reflect acute infarction in the ***mid-anterior* wall** rather than in the “lateral” wall of the heart. These MRI correlations are consistent with the *Clinical* Synthesis we propose above. \n\n \n\n**ECG findings** differ with ***acute* LCx occlusion** in a ***left-dominant* system**. As emphasized in **Panel B** of Figure 10.28-1 — the LCx is a *larger* vessel in the 10-20% of patients with a *left-dominant* circulation, in which case the LCx supplies the inferior *and* posterior walls of the LV *as well as* the *lateral* wall.\n\n+ Suspect ***Circumflex* dominance** — IF **i\\)** you see *infero-postero-lateral* MI; and **ii\\)** there is significant ST elevation in leads V5,V6. \n\n \n\nConsider the situation in **Figure 10.28-2** — obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain.\n\n+ Interpret this ECG. Localize the area\\(s\\) of acute infarction. \n+ *Which* coronary artery is likely to be acutely occluded? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.28-2:** Acute *infero-postero-lateral* MI. This distribution on ECG suggests a ***left-dominant* circulation** with ***acute* LCx occlusion**. Findings *against* RCA involvement are: **i\\)** *Less* ST elevation in lead III *than* lead II; **ii\\)** *minimal* ST depression in aVL; and **iii\\)** ST elevation in V5,V6 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.28-2:** The rhythm is sinus. Intervals and axis are normal. No chamber enlargement. Regarding **Q-R-S-T Changes**:\n\n+ *Small* q waves are seen in leads II,III,aVF; and V5,V6. \n+ Transition is normal \\(*occurs between lead V2-to-V3*\\) — albeit the R wave is a bit *taller-than-expected* in leads V2,V3. \n+ There is *subtle-but-real* **ST elevation** in *each* of the ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — with suggestion of ***hyperacute* T waves** \\(*especially in lead II*\\). A similar pattern of *slight* J-point ST elevation is seen in **leads V5,V6** — with suggestion of *hyperacute* T waves in these leads. \n+ There is ***marked* ST depression** in leads V1-*thru*-V4. \n\n \n\n**Impression:** Sinus rhythm with **acute *infero-postero-lateral* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\). The cath lab should be activated. We suspect **acute LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Artery*\\) **occlusion** in a *left-dominant* system.\n\n+ Although **q waves** in the *infero-lateral* leads are small and narrow — these are the very *same* leads that manifest ST elevation with *hyperacute* T waves. While these might possibly be normal *septal* q waves — it is far more likely that they reflect ongoing *acute* infarction. In *any* case — We should know the answer shortly \\(*if the q waves become larger as the infarct evolves – *or* – if they resolve after reperfusion*\\). \n+ The ECG picture in leads V1,V2,V3 strongly suggests *associated* **acute *posterior* infarction**. We say this despite the reality that *none* of the standard 12 leads directly visualize the *posterior* wall of the LV \\(*Left Ventricle*\\). As will be discussed in Section 10.35 — **to *diagnose* acute *posterior* MI,** one *either* has to: **i\\)** Obtain ***additional* leads** that directly visualize the posterior wall \\(= *leads V7,V8,V9*\\); or **ii\\)** Perform a ***“mirror”* test** \\(*turning the tracing over and holding it up to the light *— *which provides a mirror-image view of the anterior leads* — **Figure 10.28-3**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.28-3:** Diagnosis of *acute* ***posterior* MI** is made from Figure 10.28-2 by applying the ***“mirror”* test** \\(ie, *turning the tracing over and holding it up to the light*\\). Doing so \\(*TOP tracing*\\) shows the *anterior* ST depression and relatively tall R waves in V2,V3 of the *LOWER* tracing *become* Q waves *and* ST elevation when the tracing is flipped over \\(*See within the red rectangle of the TOP tracing*\\).\n\n**Figure 10.28-2: *Localizing the “Culprit” Artery*** — Given the presence of acute *inferior* infarction without *anterior* ST elevation in Figure 10.28-2 — the “culprit” artery is almost certainly ***either*** the **RCA** \\(*Right Coronary Artery*\\) or the **LCx** \\(*Left Circumflex Coronary Artery*\\).\n\n+ As discussed in Section 10.23 — **acute *proximal* RCA occlusion** would be suggested by: **i\\)** ST elevation in **lead III** \u003e lead II; **ii\\)** marked *reciprocal* ST depression in lead aVL that is *more* than the ST depression in lead I; and **iii\\)** ECG evidence of *acute* RV MI \\(*the LCx does not supply the right ventricle*\\). While on occasion *acute* RCA occlusion may produce ST elevation in leads V5,V6 \\(ie, *if there is a large posterolateral branch arising from the PDA branch of the RCA*\\) — ST elevation in lead V6 should *not* be more than in lead III. \n+ In **Figure 10.28.2** \\(*reproduced in the LOWER tracing of* Fig. 10.28-3\\) — We strongly suspect the ***“culprit”* artery** is the **LCx** in a ***left-dominant* system** because: **i\\)** ST elevation in lead III is *less* than in lead II; **ii\\)** There is *no* ST elevation in lead aVL; **iii\\)** There is *no* hint of acute RV involvement \\(*ST depression is prominent in V1 — whereas we’d expect either a flat or coved ST segment with slight elevation in V1 if there was associated RV involvement*\\); and **iv\\)** There is ST elevation in V5,V6 — and this ST elevation in lead V6 is clearly more than it is in lead III. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.29 – Acute *Right Ventricular* Infarction**\n\n\n\n**10.30 – *Acute* RV MI: *Hemodynamics***\n\nA substantial proportion of patients with acute *inferior* MI *also* manifest RV involvement. This is especially true when there is ***proximal* RCA occlusion** — as suggested by the **ECG signs** of: **i\\)** ST elevation in **lead III** \u003e lead II; and **ii\\)** *marked* ST depression in lead aVL that is more than in lead I \\(*Section 10.23*\\).\n\n+ The importance of recognizing RV involvement with *inferior* MI relates to its ***different* hemodynamics** \\(*nitroglyercin not advised because it may excessively lower BP; volume-dependent hypotension that often responds well to IV fluid infusion; frequent need for extremely close ICU monitoring*\\). \n+ *Many* patients with acute *inferior* MI from RCA occlusion have at least ***some* degree of RV involvement**. This should *not* be unexpected — given normal distribution of the RCA that typically supplies *both* the RV *as well as* the *inferior* wall of the LV. That said, even when there is *some* RV involvement — LV involvement often predominates. The ***KEY*** is to identify those patients at ***high* risk** of **decompensation** from altered hemodynamics. Clinically — this may be suggested by: **i\\)** ECG evidence of a ***large* acute RV MI** \\(*Section 10.32*\\); **ii\\)** The combination of *inferior* MI with borderline or low BP — especially if signs of *left-sided* heart failure \\(ie, *rales*\\) are absent; and **iii\\)** A *hypotensive* response to nitroglycerin — especially in patients with acute *inferior* MI. \n+ ***Clinical* NOTE:** Some emergency systems eliminate all use of NTG \\(*nitroglycerin*\\) in *any* patient with acute *inferior* MI. While realizing the rationale for this practice \\(*possibility of associated RV involvement with risk of inducing hypotension*\\) — global elimination of NTG for all patients with *inferior* MI is *not* necessarily needed or advisable. ***BOTTOM* Line:** We suggest the following: **i\\)** Do *not* use NTG in *acute* MI patients when BP is low \\(*or relatively low*\\) — especially when hypovolemia is suspected; **ii\\)** Be especially cautious in patients suspected of having *significant* RV involvement; **iii\\)** Careful titration of IV NTG may be indicated in selected patients with adequate BP. In contrast — use of *sublingual* NTG in such patients may be *ill-advised* because of inability to take a sublingual dose back; and **iv\\)** You should follow the *standard-of-care* protocols put forth at your institution. \n\n \n\n**10.31 – *Acute* RV MI: *Use of Right-Sided Leads***\n\n*Definitive* ECG diagnosis of ***acute* RV** \\(*Right Ventricular*\\)** MI** is made by use of ***right-sided* ECG leads**. A *right-sided* ECG is performed using *similar* anatomic placement of precordial leads — except that chest leads are positioned on the *right* side of the chest \\(**Figure 10.31-1**\\).\n\n+ *Right-sided* ECG leads are labeled V1R,V2R,V3R,V4R,V5R,V6R. \n+ When obtaining leads V1R and V2R — one simply *reverses* the anatomic lead position of normal leads V1 and V2. That is — ***normally* placed lead V1** will be the **equivalent** *of ****right-sided* lead V2** \\(*V2R*\\). Similarly — normally placed lead V2 will be the equivalent *of right-sided* lead V1 \\(*V1R*\\). This explains why ***normally-placed* lead V1** is really a ***right-sided* lead** \\(*Section 10.32*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.31-1:** Anatomic landmarks for normal \\(*left-sided*\\) precordial lead placement \\(**Panel A** — *which was previously discussed in Section 03.6*\\). To obtain ***right-sided*** precordial leads \\(**Panel B**\\) — *similar* anatomic landmarks are used, but leads are placed on the *right* side of the chest \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**10.32 – *Acute* RV MI: *Making the Diagnosis by ECG***\n\nAs stated — ECG diagnosis of ***acute* RV** \\(*Right Ventricular*\\)** MI** is made by use of ***right-sided* ECG leads**. The following findings should be looked for:\n\n+ ECG evidence of **associated *proximal* RCA occlusion** \\(ie, ***acute inferior MI**** with ST elevation in lead III \u003e II* and *marked ST depression in lead aVL*\\). \n+ *Progressively* increasing ST elevation as one moves across *right-sided* leads. *Right-sided* ST elevation is often ***maximal*** in **lead V4R**. \n+ ST segment coving or straightening \\(*especially if there is slight ST elevation*\\) in **lead V1** — in association with acute *infero-postero* MI \\(**Figure 10.32-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.32-1:** *Schematic* ECG showing acute *infero-postero* MI. ***Proximal* RCA occlusion** is suggested by ST elevation in lead III \u003e lead II with marked *reciprocal* ST depression in lead aVL that is more than in lead I. ***Acute* RV MI** is *suggested* by ST coving in lead V1 and *confirmed* by obtaining *right-sided* leads \\(*Note ST elevation in V2R through V4R*\\).\n\n***KEY* Point: *Use of Lead V1 in* Figure 10.32-1:** Although *right-sided* leads V2R,V3R,V4R confirm the diagnosis of acute RV MI in Figure 10.32-1 — these extra leads are *not* essential for making the diagnosis:\n\n+ As illustrated in Figure 10.31-1 — **lead V1** is really a ***right-sided* lead**. Anatomic landmarks for placement of lead V1 are *the same* as they are for placement of lead V2R. \n+ The *schematic* ECG in Fig. 10.32-1 shows **acute *infero-postero* MI**. Acute *posterior* involvement is suggested by the *shape* of ST depression in leads V2,V3 \\(= *positive “mirror test” — as will be discussed in Section 10.35*\\). When there is simply *posterior* infarction — **lead V1** will manifest a *similar* shape of ST depression as is seen in leads V2,V3. However, IF there is *also* acute RV MI — then the ST depression *that should have been seen* in lead V1 \\(*as a result of the posterior MI*\\) — will be *cancelled out* by the ST elevation in lead V1 from the *acute* RV MI. ***BOTTOM* Line:** The fact that the ST segment in **lead V1** of *schematic* Figure 10.32-1 is coved \\(*if not slightly elevated instead of being depressed*\\) — strongly suggests that *in addition* to acute *infero-postero* MI, there is *also* ***acute* RV MI**. This is different than the situation with acute *anterior* MI — in which case *not only* lead V1, but *also* other anterior leads will manifest ST elevation \\(*V2,V3,V4*\\). \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Notes: *Beyond-the-Core:*** Opinions vary as to the need for *additional* leads to make the diagnosis of *acute* RV MI. Depending on the ECG recording system used and experience of the person recording the 12-lead tracing — a certain amount of *additional* time will be required to obtain more than the standard 12 leads. This time may be minimal \\(*seconds*\\) — or it may take a *precious* minute or more. *You will not know how long it takes to get right-sided lead\\(s\\) unless and until you actually time yourself under real-life circumstances*.\n\n+ ***Our* Bias:** We prefer to ***start*** with **12 leads**. Much \\(*most*\\) of the time — 12 leads are *all* that will be needed in order to determine what you need to know to optimally manage the patient. That said — We fully acknowledge that there *are* times when additional leads may be extremely helpful. \n+ Clearly, a balance must be struck between *urgency* of the situation — *How Long* it will take to obtain additional leads — and whether this time is really worth what you’ll *actually* learn from getting more leads. For example — IF there is obvious acute *proximal* RCA occlusion on *initial* ECG obtained by EMS providers in a *prehospital* setting — there is little to learn that will *change* management by spending extra time prior to transport in recording *right-sided* leads \\(ie, *the cath lab will need to be activated regardless*\\). \n+ In a more stable setting when there is time to obtain *additional* leads — the most *sensitive* ECG indicator of ***acute* RV MI** is the presence of **≥1mm ST elevation** in **lead V4R**. This finding may be transient — so ***right-sided* leads** should be obtained *as early as feasible* when looking for RV MI. \n\n \n\nConsider the situation in **Figure 10.32-2** — obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain. Note that ***right-sided* leads** = **V3R** and **V4R** have been obtained \\(*and are seen instead of leads V3,V4 on this 12-lead tracing*\\).\n\n+ Localize the area\\(s\\) of acute infarction. \n+ What is the location of acute coronary occlusion? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.32-2:** Acute *infero-postero *MI. In addition — ST coving with slight elevation in **lead V1** \\(*blue blow-up insert*\\) suggests ***acute* RV MI**. This is supported by the presence of *marked* ST elevation in ***right-sided* leads V3R** and **V4R** \\(*red blow-up inserts*\\). Posterior MI is diagnosed by the *positive* “mirror” test in lead V2 \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.32-2:** The rhythm is sinus bradycardia. There is *marked* ST elevation in each of the *inferior* leads. ST elevation in **lead III \u003e** lead II — suggesting **acute *proximal* RCA occlusion**. This is supported by the finding of *marked* ST depression in **lead aVL** that is *more* than in lead I.\n\n+ **Acute* posterior* MI** — is suggested by the shape of ST depression in lead V2 \\(*positive “mirror” test*\\). \n+ ***Acute* RV MI** is *suggested* by ST segment coving \\(*with a hint of ST elevation*\\) in **lead V1** in the presence of ST depression in lead V2. \n+ Use of ***right-sided* leads V3R** *and* **V4R** confirms the diagnosis of ***acute* RV MI**. Note how *marked* ST elevation is in leads V3R and V4R. Given the presence of sinus bradycardia — *marked* inferior ST elevation with equally *marked* reciprocal ST depression — and large associated *acute* RV MI — this patient is likely to manifest *volume-dependent* hemodynamics, and will clearly require intensive care monitoring. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.33 – *Posterior* MI: *Use of the Mirror Test***\n\n\n\nOne area of the heart that is *not* well visualized by any of the 12-leads of a standard ECG is the *posterior* wall of the left ventricle. This clinical reality makes it challenging to recognize new or old *posterior* infarction.\n\n+ Use of the ***“Mirror”* Test** facilitates recognizing ECG changes of **acute *posterior* MI** from the standard 12-lead tracing \\(**Figure 10.33-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.33-1:** The ***“Mirror”* Test**. *None* of the standard 12 leads of an ECG directly visualize the posterior wall of the left ventricle. As a result — *indirect* visualization of the ***opposite*** \\(= *anterior*\\) **wall** may be used to provide insight regarding *acute* posterior changes that may be ongoing. ***Anterior* leads V1,V2,V3** \\(*within the red rectangle*\\) — are used in the *“mirror”* test \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**10.34 – BEYOND-the-Core: *Is there Truly a Posterior Wall?***\n\nRecently — MRI correlations with cardiac anatomy, coronary artery distribution, and ECG findings suggest that *traditional* ECG terminology is *not* as accurate as previously thought \\(*Bayes de Luna et al: Circulation 114:1755, 2006*\\). Thus, the anatomic relationship of the “posterior” wall — is in reality *not* as directly posterior as depicted in Figure 10.33-1. Instead — what traditionally has been thought of as “posterior” wall involvement is more accurately referred to as involvement of part of the *lateral* LV wall.\n\n+ A new, more anatomically accurate terminology has been proposed. This would *change* reference to the *posterior* LV wall to the ***lateral* wall** instead. \n+ **MY BIAS:** Realizing the potential *tremendous* benefit MRI correlations may provide toward more accurate anatomic localization — ***traditional* ECG terminology** appears *entrenched* at the current time. Rather than confusing the issue with a novel ECG terminology that is *not yet *in general use — **We favor *continued* use** of the term ***posterior* infarction** \\(*with continued distinction between lateral vs posterior walls of the heart*\\). We devote Sections 10.33 *through* 10.37 to recognition of *posterior* wall MI according to the *traditional* terminology that we use throughout this ePub. We realize that at some point in the future this terminology may change. \n\n \n\n**10.35 – FIGURE 10.35-1: *Applying the Mirror Test***\n\nWe illustrate application of the *“Mirror”* Test in *schematic* **Figure 10.35-1**. The test is based on the principle that *anterior* leads provide a *mirror image* of electrical activity occurring over the *posterior* wall of the LV. We emphasize the following points:\n\n+ Most patients with acute *posterior* MI — *also* manifest ECG evidence of **acute *inferior* MI**. This is seen in the *lower* tracing \\(**Panel B**\\) of Figure 10.35-1 — in which there are small q waves and ST segment elevation in *each* of the *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\). In support of the diagnosis of acute *inferior* infarction — is *reciprocal* ST depression in leads I and aVL. \n+ One looks for a ***tall* R wave** in **lead V1** \\(*or at least taller-than-expected R waves in V2, V3*\\) plus a *peculiar* shape of ***anterior* ST depression**. This is well seen in leads V1,V2,V3 *within* the *red rectangle* in **Panel B**. \n+ Flipping the tracing over and holding it up to the light \\(ie, *performing the “mirror” test*\\) reveals that what was ST depression and a disproportionately *tall* R wave in *anterior* leads \\(*in* Panel B\\) — *becomes* a Q wave with worrisome ST elevation = a ***positive* “mirror” test** \\(Panel A\\). This strongly suggests that in addition to acute *inferior* MI — there is *also* ongoing **acute *posterior* MI**. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.35-1:** *Positive* “mirror test” — as seen when the upright initial ECG in Panel B is *flipped over* \\(**Panel A**\\) and held up to the light. **NOTE:** The *more* ST depression you see in *anterior* leads V1,V2,V3 \\(Panel B\\) — the *more *extensive the ***infero-postero *MI** is likely to be\\!\n\n**NOTE:** The “mirror” test — is nothing more than a visual aid that we have conceived to facilitate recognition of *posterior* infarction \\(*Grauer K, circa 1983*\\). We have already seen application of this ***visual* aid** to facilitate recognition of the *peculiar* shape of *anterior* ST depression in the example of acute* infero-postero-lateral* MI that was presented in Figure 10.28-3 — which we reproduce below in **Figure 10.35-2**.\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.35-2:** Illustration of a ***positive* “mirror” test** in this patient with acute *infero-lateral-postero* MI due to acute occlusion of a *dominant* LCx \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.28-3\\). The original *upright* ECG is shown in the *lower* tracing \\(**Panel B**\\). Note ST elevation in leads II,III,aVF and in leads V5,V6 — consistent with acute *infero-lateral* MI. Diagnosis of associated **acute *posterior* MI** is made by applying the ***“mirror”* test** \\(ie, *turning the tracing in Panel B over, and holding it up to the light*\\). Doing so \\(*as shown for leads V1,V2,V3 within the red rectangle in ***Panel A**\\) — reveals how the *anterior* ST depression and relatively tall R waves in leads V2,V3 of Panel B *become* Q waves *and* ST elevation when the tracing is flipped over.\n\n**10.36 – FIGURE 10.36-1: *Anatomic Landmarks for Posterior Leads***\n\nAn alternative approach to using the *mirror* test — is the use of ***posterior* leads** to diagnose or *confirm* diagnosis of *posterior* MI. These may be obtained separately — incorporated into a 15-lead ECG \\(*which typically adds leads V4R, V8, and V9 to the standard 12 leads*\\) — or substituted for one or more lateral precordial leads on a standard ECG.\n\n+ ***Posterior* leads** most commonly include leads V7, V8, *and/or* V9. These leads are obtained by continuing *laterally* along the **same *horizontal* level** as **lead V6** in the *posterior* axillary line \\(= **lead V7**\\) — at the *tip* of the left scapula in the back \\(= **lead V8**\\) — and in the left paraspinal area *in between* the scapula and posterior spine \\(= **lead V9**\\). \n+ ***Anatomic* landmarks** for *posterior* leads are shown in **Figure 10.36-1**. We then conclude this segment on *posterior* infarction by illustrating how posterior leads are used to confirm acute posterior MI in Section 10.37. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.36-1:** *Anatomic* landmarks for *posterior* leads. The **Lead V7** electrode — is placed in the *posterior* axillary line at the *same* horizontal level as lead V6. **Lead V8** — is placed in the back at the tip of the left scapula \\(*at the same horizontal level as lead V6*\\). **Lead V9** — is placed in the back in the left paraspinal area *in between* the scapula and posterior spine \\(*at the same horizontal level as lead V6*\\).\n\n**10.37 – FIGURE 10.37-1: *Isolated Posterior Infarction***\n\nAs emphasized in Section 10.35 — *most* patients with acute *posterior* MI *also* manifest ECG evidence of acute *inferior* MI. This is because the RCA commonly supplies *both* the *inferior* and *posterior* walls of the left ventricle. Acute occlusion of the RCA therefore commonly results in acute *infero-postero* MI.\n\n+ Even when there is *acute* occlusion of a *dominant* LCx artery \\(*as in* Panel B *of* Figure 10.35-2\\) — acute *inferior* and *posterior* infarction almost always occur together. \n+ On occasion, however — ***posterior* MI** may be ***isolated***. This may occur IF the acute occlusion is at the level of the PDA \\(*Posterior Descending Artery*\\). Because the PDA may arise from *either* the RCA or the LCx \\(*if there is a left-dominant circulation *— *as described in Section 10.28*\\) — it may *not* be possible by ECG to identify the “culprit artery” on those relatively rare occasions when there is *isolated* posterior MI. \n\n \n\nConsider the ECG shown in Panel A of **Figure 10.37-1** — in which there is ECG evidence of ***isolated* acute *posterior* MI**. Note the *absence* of any indication of acute inferior MI \\(*no inferior ST elevation — and no more than minimal if any ST depression in leads I and aVL*\\).\n\n+ *Acute* changes in **Panel A** of Figure 10.37-1 are subtle. Nevertheless — the R wave in leads V2,V3 of Panel A are disproportionately tall \\(*especially in view of no more than a tiny r wave in lead V1*\\) — and there is *significant* ST depression that is most *marked* in leads V2,V3,V4. **Acute *posterior* MI** is strongly suggested by a *positive* “mirror” test \\(**Panel C** *compared to upright leads V1,V2,V3 in* Panel B\\). \n+ Acute *posterior* MI is ***confirmed*** by Q waves with ST elevation in ***posterior* leads V7** and **V9** \\(*leads outlined in red in* **Panel D**\\). \n\n \n\n•\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.37-1:** An example of ***isolated* posterior MI**. Diagnosis of acute *posterior* MI is suggested in **Panel A** by *anterior* ST depression \\(*most marked in V2,V3,V4*\\) and disproportionately tall R waves in V2,V3. A ***positive* “mirror test”** in **Panel C** \\(*compared to upright leads V1,V2,V3 in* Panel B\\) supports this diagnosis. Use of ***posterior* leads V7** and **V9** showing Q waves and ST elevation confirms the diagnosis of *posterior* MI \\(**Panel D**\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.38 – *Acute* MI: *PRACTICE Tracings***\n\n\n\nWe consolidate principles covered thus far in discussion of the ECG diagnosis of ***Acute* MI/Ischemia** with a series of ***Practice* Tracings**.\n\n+ We begin with a full 12-lead tracing \\(*Section 10.39*\\). \n+ There follows a series of 12 *schematic* ECGs \\(*Section 10.40*\\). \n+ For *each* tracing *—* Identify ECG findings suggestive of ischemia/infarction. IF relevant *—* Try to identify the ***“culprit”* artery** in each case.  \n\n \n\n**HINT:** Feel free to refer back to previous segments on:\n\n+ ECG Changes of *Acute* Infarction \\(*Sections 10.1 through 10.10*\\). \n+ Sequence of ECG Changes \\(*Sections 10.11 through 10.15*\\). \n+ The Coronary Circulation \\(*Sections 10.16 through 10.21*\\). \n+ Identifying the “Culprit” Artery \\(*Sections 10.22 through 10.28*\\). \n+ Acute RV MI \\(*Sections 10.29 through 10.32*\\). \n+ Posterior MI/Mirror Test \\(*Sections 10 through 10.37*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.39 – FIGURE 10.39-1: *What is the “Culprit” Artery?***\n\nInterpret the ECG in **Figure 10.39-1** *—* obtained from a patient with ***new-onset* chest pain**.\n\n+ Can you localize the site\\(s\\) of *acute* infarction? \n+ What is the ***“culprit”* artery** likely to be? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.39-1:** Sinus rhythm with PACs. Can you localize the site\\(s\\) of *acute* infarction? What is the ***“culprit”* artery** likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.39-1:** Although at first glance, the rhythm irregularity apparent for the first few beats looks like atrial fibrillation \\(*AFib*\\) *— *the rhythm then becomes more regular \\(*right after the first lead switch to leads aVR,aVL,aVF*\\). From this point on *— ****sinus* P waves** with a constant PR interval precede QRS complexes in most leads. Thus, the ***rhythm*** is **sinus** *with* **PACs**. The QRS is of normal duration, and the QT interval is not prolonged. The axis is normal \\(*about \\+60 degrees*\\). There is no chamber enlargement. The most remarkable findings relate to QRST changes:\n\n+ **Q-R-S-T Changes:** There are **Q waves** in the ***inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) *— *and *small* q waves are also seen in *lateral* precordial leads V5,V6. R wave progression reveals transition to be normal \\(*between V2-to-V3*\\) *— *albeit R wave amplitude in lead V3 appears to be somewhat *taller-than-expected* for this lead. The most striking findings relate to ST-T wave changes. \n+ There is **ST elevation** in *each* of the ***inferior*** *leads*. ST elevation is clearly *most* marked in **lead III**. \n+ There is ***reciprocal* ST depression** in** leads I** and **aVL**. This ST depression is *more* prominent in lead aVL. \n+ There is also *subtle-but-real* J-point ST depression in leads V2,V3,V4. Finally *— *there is prominent **T wave *peaking*** in **lead V3**, and perhaps to a lesser extent in lead V4. \n\n \n\nIn view of the history of *new-onset* chest pain *—* the ECG in Figure 10.39-1 is virtually diagnostic of **acute *infero-postero* STEMI**.\n\n+ As to the “culprit” artery *—* We strongly suspect ***acute* RCA occlusion** because: **i\\)** there is acute *inferior* MI *with* ST elevation in lead III \u003e lead II; **ii\\)** there is significant *reciprocal* ST depression in lead aVL that is *at least as marked* as in lead I; and **iii\\)** there is *no* ST elevation in *lateral* precordial leads V5,V6 *— *as there generally is when the “culprit” vessel is a *dominant* LCx \\(*Section 10.28*\\). \n+ Support that QRS morphology and the ST-T wave changes seen in the *anterior* leads of Figure 10.39-1 is suggestive of acute *posterior* involvement *—* is forthcoming from a **positive *“mirror”* test** \\(*seen in* **Panel B** *of* **Figure 10.39-2**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.39-2:** Leads V1,V2,V3 from the ECG in Figure 10.39-1 are reproduced in **Panel A**. There is a **positive *“mirror test”*** in **Panel B** *—* in that the relatively tall R wave, depressed ST segment and *markedly* peaked T wave in lead V3 of Panel A *— becomes* a deep Q, elevated ST and deeply inverted T wave when the tracing is flipped over in **Panel B**.\n\n***Additional* Points on Localizing the “Culprit” Artery:** We expand on our rationale for strongly suspecting the RCA as the “culprit” artery for the ECG in Figure 10.39-1. Practically speaking *— *the *majority* of **acute *infero-postero* STEMIs** will be the result of **RCA** \\(*rather than LCx*\\) **occlusion**, as ~85% of patients have a *right-dominant* circulation \\(*Section 10.17*\\). Recognizing that the *amount* of **ST elevation** in **lead III** is clearly ***more*** than in lead II *— strongly *favors RCA occlusion \\(*especially when there is significant ****reciprocal ST depression**** in ***lead aVL**\\).\n\n+ We next look to see IF there is **ST elevation** in **leads V5,V6**? IF there is *—* then the “culprit” artery could be *either* the RCA or a *dominant-left* Circumflex \\(*LCx*\\) artery \\(*since large postero-lateral artery branches may occasionally arise off the PDA from an RCA occlusion — as described in Section 10.18 — and as illustrated in *Figure 10.28-3\\). \n+ BUT *—* IF there is *acute infero-postero-lateral* STEMI but *no* ST elevation in leads V5,V6 \\(*as is the case in* Figure 10.39-1\\) *—* it becomes highly *likely* that the “culprit” artery is the RCA \\(*since one expects ST elevation in V5,V6 with left-dominant LCx occlusion*\\). \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* A final reason to support our suspicion of ***acute* RCA occlusion** for the ECG in Figure 10.39-1 *— *is the ST-T wave appearance in **lead V1**, which shows a ***flat* ST segment** \\(*rather than ST segment depression*\\).\n\n+ In the presence of simple acute *infero-postero* MI *—* **lead V1** typically manifests a *similar-shape* ST segment as leads V2,V3. Thus, there should usually be *some* ST depression in lead V1 *— *albeit *less* than is usually seen in other anterior leads. \n+ IF instead of being depressed *— *the ST-T wave in lead V1 is flat or coved \\(*or elevated*\\) *— *then **associated *acute* RV** \\(*Right Ventricular*\\) **involvement** is likely. This is because the ST elevation from *acute* RV MI that we would *expect* to see in *right-sided* lead V1 *—* is in part *cancelled out* by ST depression from the *posterior* infarction \\(*Section 10.32*\\). \n+ IF there is a need to confirm acute RV involvement *— *then obtaining *right-sided* leads \\(*Section 10.31*\\) should tell us for certain. \n+ Identification of *acute* RV involvement localizes the “culprit” artery to the RCA *— *because the LCx does *not* supply the right ventricle. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40 – *Schematic* PRACTICE Tracings: *Acute MI/Ischemia***\n\nAs PRACTICE *— *We consolidate Review of the principles for ***identifying*** the **probable *“culprit”* artery** with ***acute* STEMI** in the following 12 *schematic* tracings \\(*Sections 10.40.1 through 10.40.12*\\).\n\n+ For *each* of these ***schematic* ECGs** *— *the rhythm is sinus and the patient presents with ***“chest pain”***.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-1:** There is ***marked* ST elevation** in *both* of the ***high lateral* leads** \\(*I,aVL*\\). In addition — leads I and aVL also manifest a *small* q wave and beginning T wave inversion. **Other *acute* findings** on this tracing include:\n\n+ **Leads V5,V6** — manifest a small q wave and ST elevation. \n+ ***Inferior* leads** \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) — manifest marked *reciprocal* ST depression. \n+ There is also *subtle-but-real* ***reciprocal* ST depression** in **leads V2,V3**. Note the *red arrow* in Figure 10.40-1 — which defines the **J-point** \\(*junction between the end of the S wave — *and* the beginning of the ST segment*\\). The slope changes at the J-point — with the ST segment seen to be significantly *below* the PR baseline. \n+ **Impression:** — Extensive **acute *lateral* STEMI** involving *high lateral* leads I,aVL and lateral *precordial* leads V5,V6. \n+ **Probable *“Culprit”* Artery:** — *Acute* occlusion of the LCx \\(*Section 10.28*\\). \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-1:** As emphasized in Section 10.28 — the lateral leads that most consistently assess the part of the heart supplied by the **LCx** are **leads V5,V6**. It will be rare indeed that you’ll encounter the combination of lateral lead findings shown in Figure 10.40-1, with near *“tombstone-type”* ST elevation in leads I and aVL. Thus, this *schematic* tracing is admittedly theoretical. Nevertheless, as a practice exercise — *lack* of inferior and anterior ST elevation suggest the LCx as the culprit artery.\n\n+ Finally — Note the small and ***narrow* q waves** in ***lateral* leads** I, aVL, V5 and V6 of Figure 10.40-1. Because these q waves are small and narrow — the question arises as to whether they might represent **normal *septal* q waves** *instead of* infarction q waves? Small septal q waves may normally be seen in healthy subjects in one or more of the lateral leads. That said — associated *dramatic* ST-T wave changes in this tracing strongly suggest they are ***infarction* q waves**. Subsequent tracings should clarify the issue — as we would expect these Q waves to deepen and widen as the infarct evolves. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.2 – FIGURE 10.40-2: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-2:** There is **ST elevation** in both ***high lateral* leads** \\(ie, *in lead I and lead aVL*\\). The *only* other lead showing ST elevation on this tracing is **lead V2**. This is indeed an unusual picture. **Other *acute* findings** include:\n\n+ ***Reciprocal* ST depression** — in the inferior leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) and in leads V3,V4. \n+ **Impression:** — Acute ***high lateral* STEMI**, with *in addition* ST elevation that is localized to lead V2. \n+ **Probable *“Culprit”* Artery:** — *Acute* occlusion of the **1st Diagonal branch** of the **LAD** \\(*Section 10.25*\\). \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-2:** The ECG picture shown in this schematic tracing is an uncommon but important pattern to aware of. It emphasizes the ***utility*** of **ST elevation** in **lead aVL** for ***localizing*** the probable ***“culprit”* artery**. We repeat below the PEARL we presented in Section 10.25 on acute LAD occlusion:\n\nPEARL: **ST elevation** in **lead aVL** — may provide an *invaluable* clue to the location of the acutely occluded coronary artery. According to a study by Birnbaum et al \\(*Am Heart J 131:38, 1996*\\):\n\n+ *Suspect* acute **LAD occlusion *proximal*** to the **1st Diagonal** IF *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is *also* ST elevation in leads V2-through-V5. This is the most common situation when there is ST elevation in lead aVL. \n+ *Suspect* **1st *Diagonal* branch occlusion** IF *in addition* to ST elevation in aVL — there is ST elevation in lead V2 \\(*but not in V3,V4,V5*\\). \n+ *Suspect* **LCx occlusion** \\(*especially of the* **1st obtuse *marginal* branch**\\) — IF there is ST elevation in aVL but *not* in lead V2 \\(*and not in other anterior leads*\\). \n+ **NOTE:** *Anterior* ST elevation ***without* ST elevation** in **lead aVL** — suggests more *distal* LAD occlusion *after* takeoff of the 1st Diagonal. \n\n \n\n*Beyond-the-Core:* We are aware of several cases in which awareness of the pattern shown in Figure 10.40-2 was of great assistance to the consulting cardiologist in identifying the site of acute coronary occlusion. A *totally* occluded 1st or 2nd LAD Diagonal branch may *not* always be readily apparent \\(*since no dye enters an occluded vessel*\\). Recognizing the specific *localizing* value of **ST elevation** in **lead aVL** and in **lead V2** but ***not*** in any ***other* anterior leads** — helped the cardiologist to *know* exactly where to look on acute cardiac cath for the site of occlusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.3 – FIGURE 10.40-3: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-3:** There is **ST segment *coving*** *\\(“frowny” shape appearance*\\) *with* **ST elevation** in the ***precordial* leads**. This is *most* marked in leads V2,V3,V4. **Other *acute* findings** on this tracing include:\n\n+ *Preservation* of the *initial* r wave in leads V1,V2,V3. This implies that the septum is still intact. That said *—* there is ***loss*** of **r wave** *between* lead V1-to-V2 \\(*in that r wave amplitude decreases slightly from V1-to-V2*\\). Normally, the R wave will be *taller-than-seen* in Figure 10.40-3 by lead V3. \n+ Several ***other* leads** manifest **ST elevation**. These include lead I, **lead aVL** and **lead aVR**. \n+ There is ***reciprocal* ST depression** in the *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\). \n+ Small and narrow q waves are seen in leads aVL,V5,V6. \n+ **Impression:** — Acute **extensive *antero-lateral* STEMI**. \n+ **Probable *“Culprit”* Artery:** — *Acute* occlusion of the ***proximal* LAD** \\(*Section 10.25*\\). As opposed to the case presented in Figure 10.40-2 *— *ST elevation in lead aVL is *accompanied by* diffuse precordial ST elevation. ST elevation is *also* present in lead aVR *— *but it is *not* markedly more than in lead V1. This localizes the likely site of acute occlusion to the *proximal* LAD. \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-3:** Note that the amount of ST elevation in lead V5 is not nearly as much as it is in neighboring leads V4 and V6. This highlights the concept of ***“patterns of leads”***.\n\n+ Rather than looking at each of the 12 leads on a standard ECG as a separate entity — the ***experienced* ECG “eye”** *simultaneously* assesses acute changes in *specific* lead areas. Thus, *each* of the *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) are best looked at together.

This *schematic* tracing closely resembles the ECG picture previously seen in Figure 10.28-3. ECG findings on this tracing that strongly suggest the ***“culprit”* artery** is a ***dominant* LCx** \\(*rather than the RCA*\\) include: **i\\)** ST elevation in lead III is *not* more than in lead II; **ii\\)** ST depression in lead aVL is *not* more than in lead I; **iii\\)** There is *significant* **ST elevation** in **leads V5,V6** that appears to be *more* than the amount of ST elevation in lead III; and **iv\\)** There is *no* suggestion of acute RV involvement \\(ie, *the ST segment in lead V1 is depressed and similar in shape to the ST depression seen in leads V2,V3*\\). \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-4:** Note the presence of small and *narrow* **q waves** in *both* inferior and lateral precordial leads. The question arises as to whether these are likely to represent **normal *septal* q waves** vs* infarction* q waves?\n\n+ Small septal q waves may normally be seen in one or more of the *lateral* leads. While possible for small and narrow q waves to also be “septal” when seen in the *inferior* leads — this is *less* likely \\(*especially when the patient does not have a vertical axis*\\). Given the overall ECG picture in Figure 10.40-4 — We strongly suspect that the *infero-lateral* q waves seen on this tracing are ***infarction* q waves** that will probably become *larger* as the infarct evolves. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.5 – FIGURE 10.40-5: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

ECG findings on this tracing that strongly suggest the ***“culprit”* artery** is the ***proximal* RCA** \\(*rather than a dominant LCx*\\) include: **i\\)** ST elevation in **lead III** that is clearly *more* than in lead II; **ii\\)** *Marked* ST depression in lead aVL that is *more* than in lead I; **iii\\)** No more than *minimal* ST elevation in leads V5,V6 — that is *less* in amount than the ST elevation seen in lead III; and **iv\\)** Suggestion of ***acute* RV involvement** by the upright T wave and level ST segment in *right-sided* lead V1. One usually expects to see ST depression in **lead V1** \\(*similar to ST depression in leads V2,V3*\\) when there is simple *posterior* MI *without* associated RV involvement \\(*Section 10.32*\\). \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-5:** The ECG picture in this schematic tracing illustrates an instance in which there may be ST elevation in leads V5,V6 that is *not* the result of acute LCx occlusion.\n\n+ On occasion *— *the **PDA** may give rise to large **PLA** \\(*Postero-Lateral Artery*\\) **branches** that extend laterally to supply parts of the LV free \\(*lateral*\\) wall.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-6:** The most remarkable findings on this *schematic* tracing are seen in leads V2 *through *V4. Other than small, narrow \\(*septal*\\) q waves in leads V5,V6 — the rest of the tracing is unremarkable. We highlight the following:\n\n+ Although small — r waves *are* present in *each* of the anterior leads. Thus, there are *no* infarction q waves. \n+ The ST segment appears to be *coved* and *slightly* elevated in leads V2,V3. It is coved but *without* ST elevation in lead V4. \n+ There is a peculiar *very steep* downslope to the *initial* portion of the T wave in leads V2,V3. \n+ **Impression:** — This *schematic* tracing suggests ***Wellens’ *Syndrome**. As will be discussed in more detail in Section 10.54 — this ECG pattern is *highly* suggestive of a ***critical* stenosis** in the ***proximal* LAD**. The patient should be *immediately* referred for timely cardiac catheterization. \n\n \n\n***Additional* Comments on Figure 10.40-6:** Recognition of Wellens’ Syndrome is a *clinical* diagnosis. There should be a history of at least *some* symptoms consistent with coronary disease. These symptoms may be fairly acute — or they could be *ongoing* for a period of time. The ECG pattern of ST-T wave changes seen in Figure 10.40-6 may be intermittent \\(*due to slight changes in the degree of LAD obstruction*\\) — or it may become persistent.\n\n+ A *key* component to Wellens’ syndrome is that infarction has *not* yet occurred. Thus, although there is *some* ST elevation in Figure 10.40-6 — it is *minimal* in amount and *no* Q waves have yet formed. This is important because the GOAL is to recognize Wellens’ Syndrome *before* acute infarction \\(= *occlusion of the LAD*\\) occurs. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.7 – FIGURE 10.40-7: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-7:** The remarkable finding on this *schematic* tracing is seen in the *anterior* leads — which show *fairly* deep and ***symmetric* T wave inversion** in **leads V2 *through* V4**. There are *no* Q waves — and R wave progression is normal \\(*transition occurs between lead V3-to-V4*\\). There may be *slight* ST elevation in lead aVR — but there are *no* other findings of note.\n\n+ **Impression:** — *Symmetric* T wave inversion in leads V2 through V4. This is consistent with ***anterior* ischemia**. *Strongly suggest clinical correlation\\!* \n\n \n\n***KEY* Points:** Clinical correlation is needed for *meaningful* interpretation of this *schematic* ECG. We simply can *not* tell from this *single* tracing IF the ECG finding of *symmetric* T wave inversion is new or old. ***More* history** and comparison with ***prior*** and ***serial* tracings** is needed.\n\n+ The findings in Figure 10.40-7 — could reflect recent* completed* infarction. Alternatively — these findings could reflect *ongoing* evolution of a *non-Q-wave* MI. Serial troponins may be needed to tell the difference. \n+ The *symmetric* T wave inversion seen here could reflect ischemia of *uncertain* duration. IF due to coronary disease — this could reflect significant narrowing of the LAD. \n+ Alternatively — T inversion could be due to some *other* cause \\(*including a noncardiac etiology*\\). For example — *anterior* T wave inversion may sometimes be an ECG indicator of *acute* pulmonary embolus \\(*Section 08.37*\\). ***BOTTOM* Line:** *Clinical* correlation is needed for *meaningful* clinical interpretation of this tracing. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.8 – FIGURE 10.40-8: *How to “Date” an Infarct?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-8:** There are *many* important findings on this *schematic* tracing. These include:\n\n+ In the ***inferior* leads** *—* there are ***large*** \\(*and wide*\\) **Q waves** in leads II,III,aVF. These are associated with ***flat* ST segments**. \n+ In the ***anterior* leads** *—* there are **QS complexes** in leads V1 *through *V4. No R wave at all is seen until lead V5. **ST segments** in the ***anterior* leads** are ***coved***, slightly **elevated** and associated with **T wave inversion**. \n+ **Impression:** — There clearly is evidence that infarction has taken place. The challenge is to attempt ***“dating”*** the one or more events that may have occurred \\(*See below*\\). That said — our interpretation of this *schematic* tracing would be as follows: i\\) **Old *inferior* MI**; and ii\\) ***Anterior* MI** of ***uncertain* age, *possibly* acute**. We would once again emphasize in our interpretation that, *“Clinical correlation is needed”*. \n\n \n\n***KEY* Concept: *How to “Date” an Infarct?*** When assessing a *symptomatic* patient for the possibility of *acute* ischemia or infarction — ECG terminology frequently refers to the presence or absence of ***“acute”* changes**. Given the importance of *prompt* revascularization for *acute* coronary occlusion — the GOAL is to identify *high-risk* patients with greatest potential for benefit. That said — Our ability to ***“date”*** an infarct is limited. Practically speaking — the *best* we can do is to classify ECG signs of infarction as *likely* to be: **i\\) *Acute****; ***ii\\) *Old****; *— or **iii\\)** Infarction of ***Uncertain* Age**.\n\n+ Examples of ***“acute”* ECG findings** are obvious in Figures 10.40-1 *through* 10.40-5. None of these tracings should pose any difficulty for recognizing the presence of *acute* MI. \n+ The *addition* of **History** to the ECG picture — may provide *invaluable* assistance for determining *onset* of the event. This is especially true when chest pain is severe and begins *abruptly*. \n+ In contrast — determining the likely “age” of an infarct *becomes* problematic when history for an “event” is indistinct \\(*minimal *or* only intermittent chest pain — *or* no chest pain at all*\\) *— *and when **ECG signs** are ***less* definite**. This is the case for assessing the ***anterior* leads** in Figure 10.40-8. The *very deep* QS complexes in leads V1 *through *V4 clearly suggest that ***anterior* MI** has occurred at *some* point in the past. Q waves of this depth \\(*QS complexes*\\) generally require a certain amount of time to develop. That said — ST segments in leads V2 *through* V4 of **Figure 10.40-8** are *coved*, slightly *elevated* and associated with T wave inversion. Whether this picture is due to recent *anterior* MI — *new* anterior MI \\(*superimposed on old infarction*\\) — or *persistent* ST elevation from ventricular aneurysm will require ***clinical* correlation** \\(*and comparison with prior tracings*\\) to sort out. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.9 – FIGURE 10.40-9: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Given *smoothness* of the J-point in leads V2,V3 *— *it is difficult to be certain how much ST elevation is actually present. It does *not* appear to be much.\n\n+ The ***shape*** of **ST elevation** in leads V2,V3 is concave up \\(*“smiley” configuration*\\). It also manifests an *upward* concavity in leads V5,V6. \n+ There is ***J-point *notching** of the initial part of the ST segment in lead V6. \n+ Small and narrow q waves are seen in lateral precordial leads V5,V6.

The only q waves present are small *— *the *shape* of ST segment elevation looks benign \\(*concave-up*\\) *— *there is J-point notching *— *and there are *no* reciprocal changes. \\(*Sections 09.17 through 09.21*\\).  \n+ On the *other* hand — We would be *less* comfortable calling the ECG pattern in Figure 10.40-9 “benign” IF the patient was older, had risk factors and presented with *new-onset* severe chest pain. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** Sometimes — ***“Ya just gotta be there”*** in order to make a clinical determination of how best to proceed. Availability of a ***prior* tracing** for comparison may prove invaluable for assuring that ST elevation is not new. On occasion — a tincture of time \\(*including serial tracings/troponins and a period of time to observe the clinical course*\\) may be needed. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.10 – FIGURE 10.40-10: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-10:** The *schematic* tracing shown here is similar in *some* regards to that from Figure 10.40-9 — in that there once again is **ST elevation** in ***anterior* precordial leads**. That said there are some *very* important differences between the 2 tracings:\n\n+ ST elevation is present not only in leads V2,V3 — but *also* in lead V1. \n+ The ***shape*** of **ST segments** in these leads is **coved** \\(*“frowny” configuration*\\). While possible that *coved* ST elevation could be a benign repolarization variant \\(*See Section 09.24*\\) — it is far more likely to indicate an acute coronary process \\(*Section 09.17*\\). \n+ There is *subtle-but-real* ST segment flattening and slight depression in *each* of the inferior leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\). Given the findings seen in leads V1,V2,V3 — this qualifies as ***reciprocal* ST depression**. \n+ Small q waves with slight ST elevation is seen in leads V5,V6. There is J-point notching in lead V6. It is difficult to tell from this single tracing if this is a benign finding or something of possible concern. \n+ **Impression:** — We are suspicious of **acute *anterior* STEMI**. Lateral precordial ST elevation may or may not be part of this process. \n+ **Probable *“Culprit”* Artery:** — *Acute* occlusion of the **LAD** — though not necessarily in its proximal portion \\(*Section 10.25*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.11 – FIGURE 10.40-11: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-11:** There are a number of findings of concern on this *schematic* tracing. These include:\n\n+ In the ***inferior* leads** *— small* Q waves with *definite* ST elevation. \n+ In the ***anterior* leads** *—* ST segment *coving* with *definite* ST elevation in leads V1 through V4. \n+ Small q waves are seen in leads V5,V6 *— *but there is no ST elevation in these leads. \n+ There is ***reciprocal* ST depression** in leads I and aVL. \n+ There appears to be *no* ST elevation in lead aVR. \n+ **Impression:** — The ECG picture clearly looks like acute *ongoing* infarction. In a patient with chest pain — we interpret these changes as suggestive of **acute *inferior*** and ***anterior* STEMI**. The question arises as to whether there is a *single* anatomic lesion that might give rise to these ECG changes that are seemingly occurring in 2 *different* lead areas? \n+ **Probable *“Culprit”* Artery:** — The left ventricular apex is often a difficult anatomic area to visualize on ECG. Changes may be subtle — or they may manifest in inferior *and/or* anterior leads. As emphasized in Section 10.27 — approximately 5-10% of normal subjects have an anatomic ***“wrap-around”* LAD** as a coronary artery variant circulation. In such cases — the LAD is a larger and longer vessel, to the point of extending *beyond* the cardiac apex and *“wrapping around”* to supply the undersurface \\(*inferior wall*\\) of the heart. Thus, we suspect *acute* occlusion of a ***“wrap-around”* LAD** as the ***“culprit”* artery** in this case \\(*Section 10.27*\\). \n+ As will be discussed in Section 10.61 — ***Takotsubo* Cardiomyopathy** is *another* potential cause of acute ST elevation in *both* inferior and anterior lead areas. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.40.12 – FIGURE 10.40-12: *Ischemia/Infarction?***\n\nThe rhythm in this *schematic* tracing is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow.

Is there *acute* infarction? If so *—* what is the *“culprit”* artery likely to be? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**ANSWER to Figure 10.40-12:** The ECG picture in this *schematic* tracing is clearly of concern. There is marked ***diffuse* ST depression** in virtually *all* leads *except* for **ST elevation** in **lead aVR**.\n\n+ **Impression:** — The ECG pattern of *diffuse* ST depression in *multiple* leads \\(*usually in at least 7 leads*\\) — with ST elevation in lead aVR — is *highly* suggestive of **3-vessel** or ***proximal* LAD/*left-main* disease**. This is especially true when this pattern is seen in an *older* adult who presents with chest discomfort \\(*Section 09.40*\\). \n+ To emphasize *key* points regarding the recognition of this ECG pattern — We repeat below the PEARL *and* NOTE previously presented in Section 09.40: \n\n \n\n**PEARL:** Distinction between *left-main* disease vs *proximal* LAD occlusion may be suggested on ECG by the ***relative* amount** of **ST elevation** seen in **lead aVR** *compared to* **lead V1**.\n\n+ Think ***Left-Main*** disease — when ST elevation in lead aVR \u003e V1. \n+ Think ***proximal* LAD** disease/occlusion — when ST elevation in lead V1 \u003e aVR. In Figure 10.40-12, given *marked* ST elevation in lead aVR in the *absence* of any ST elevation in lead V1 — one has to be concerned about significant *left-main* coronary artery narrowing. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Distinction should be made between ***acute* LMCA** \\(*Left Main Coronary Artery*\\)** occlusion** vs LMCA** disease.**\n\n+ Most patients with *acute* LMCA occlusion do *not* survive. As a result — this entity is *not* often seen and *unlikely* to be appreciated clinically. Rapid deterioration with patient demise due to cardiogenic shock is the usual result *unless* acute LMCA occlusion can be *immediately* recognized and *immediately* acted on. \n+ In those *rare* circumstances when *acute* LMCA occlusion is captured on ECG — rather than diffuse ST depression there should be diffuse precordial ST *elevation* in association with significant ST elevation in lead aVR. Thus, the ECG picture in Figure 10.40-12 should *not* be misinterpreted as consistent with LMCA “occlusion”. Instead — it suggests that there may be significant LMCA *narrowing*. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.41 – LIST \\#5: *Ant. ST Depression with Acute Inf.

In the setting of **acute *inferior* MI** — **ST depression** is commonly seen in two or more ***anterior* leads** \\(*leads V1,V2 and/or V3*\\). This concept is illustrated in the *schematic* ECG shown below in **Figure 10.42-1**:\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.42-1:** *Schematic* ECG from a patient with **acute *inferior* MI**. Note the presence of ***anterior* ST depression** \\(*in leads V1,V2,V3*\\) — the common causes of which make up our **LIST \\#5** \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**LIST \\#5:** The purpose of our 5th List is to facilitate recall of the 3 principal causes of ***anterior* ST depression** that commonly occur in the setting of **acute *inferior* MI**. *Each* of these 3 causes should be actively considered when confronted with an ECG such as that shown in *schematic* Figure 10.42-1.\n\n+ CAUSE \\#1 — ***reciprocal* ST depression** \\(*that may occur in response to the acute inferior infarction*\\). \n+ CAUSE \\#2 — ***anterior* ischemia**. Acute *inferior* MI is usually due to acute RCA occlusion. *Anterior* ischemia might be seen if *at the same time* there was symptomatic narrowing of the LAD. \n+ CAUSE \\#3 — ***posterior *MI.** \n\n \n\nThe above **3 Causes** make up our **LIST \\#5**. Keep in mind that *more than one* of these causes may be operative in any given patient \\(**Figure 10.42-2**\\):\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.42-2:** The *Common* Causes of *Anterior* ST Depression in the setting of Acute *Inferior* MI = **LIST \\#5**. More than one cause may be operative in any given patient \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***KEY* Points about LIST \\#5:** In any given patient — it may *not* be possible to distinguish which causes in List \\#5 are operative. That said — this does *not* matter clinically.\n\n+ *Regardless* of the cause\\(s\\) — **significant *anterior* ST depression** on ECG *in association with* acute *inferior* MI means a ***larger* infarct** \\(*and therefore more potential benefit from acute intervention*\\). \n+ **Acute *Posterior* MI** — will very often present when there is *anterior* ST depression in the setting of acute *inferior* MI. This is because the RCA most commonly supplies *both* the *inferior* and *posterior* wall of the LV \\(*Section 10.17*\\). Even when the “culprit” artery is a *dominant* LCx instead of the RCA — acute *inferior* and *posterior* infarction will commonly be seen together \\(*Section 10.17*\\). Use of the ***“mirror”* test** facilitates recognition of acute *posterior* MI \\(**Figure 10.42-3**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.42-3:** Application of the ***“mirror”* test** to Figure 10.42-1 \\(*which we reproduce in Panel A*\\). Flipping the tracing in **Panel A** over and holding it up to the light to perform the “mirror” test \\(**Panel B**\\) — supports the premise that **acute *posterior* MI** may be one of the causes of *anterior* ST depression that was seen in Panel A \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**10.43 – FIGURE 10.43-1: *Ant.

What is the likely cause of the marked *anterior* ST depression? **HINT:** Feel free to refer back to **List \\#5** \\(*in* Figure 10.42-2\\) in formulating your answer.\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.43-1:** The rhythm is sinus. This patient with *new-onset* chest pain is in process of evolving a large **acute *infero-postero* STEMI**. Relevant findings include the following:\n\n+ ***Dramatic* ST elevation** \\(*with ****hyperacute**** ST segments*\\) in *each* of the inferior leads. ST elevation in **lead III** is *more* than in lead II — suggesting the **RCA** is the *“culprit”* artery \\(*Section 10.23*\\). \n+ There is ***reciprocal* ST depression** in numerous other leads. This ST depression is especially marked in lead aVL — supporting the premise that there is acute RCA occlusion. ST depression is also seen in leads I; V1,V2,V3; and to a lesser degree in leads V4,V5,V6. \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Note that there is ***marked* RAD** \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) — as determined by the predominantly *negative* QRS complex in lead I. Given the *extensive* acute infarction seen here — this may reflect new *isolated* **LPHB** \\(*Left Posterior HemiBlock *— *discussed in Section 07.25*\\). \n\n \n\n***What is the Cause of Anterior ST Depression?*** The purpose of **List \\#5** — is to remind us of the 3 principal causes to consider when confronted with acute *inferior* MI and *associated* ST depression in the *anterior* leads \\(***red arrows**** in* Figure 10.43-1\\). These **3 Causes** are: **i\\)** *reciprocal* ST depression; **ii\\)** *anterior* ischemia from concomitant LAD narrowing; and **iii\\)** *posterior* MI.\n\n+ In **Figure 10.43-1** — We suspect at least 2 \\(*if not all 3*\\) of these causes are operative. ST depression is present in *multiple* leads in addition to leads V1,V2,V3. This suggests that *at least a component* of the *anterior* ST depression reflects ***reciprocal* changes**. \n+ Given the *extensive* size of the *acute* MI in Figure 10.43-1 — there may well be **associated *anterior* ischemia**. This is especially true in view of the *marked* RAD \\(*probable LPHB*\\) — as the LAD more often provides blood supply to this hemifascicle. \n+ Finally — there *almost* certainly is associated **acute *posterior* MI**, which so often accompanies acute *inferior* MI \\(*especially when size of the infarct appears to be large*\\). Note *taller-than-expected* R wave amplitude in lead V2 of Figure 10.43-1 — with the peculiar *shape* of ST depression in V2,V3 that characterizes acute *posterior* MI. The ***“mirror”* test** is *definitely* positive \\(**Figure 10.43-2**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.43-2:** Note *anterior* ST depression \\(***red arrows***\\) in this patient with acute *inferior* MI \\(*ECG in* **Panel A** *reproduced from* Figure 10.43-1\\). Application of the ***“mirror”* test** in **Panel B** — which is *positive* and supports the premise that acute *posterior* MI is one of the causes of *anterior* ST depression that was seen in Panel A.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.44 – LIST \\#6: *Tall R Wave in Lead V1***\n\n\n\nAs discussed at the very *beginning* of this ECG-2014-ePub \\(*in Section 00.7*\\) *—* We have developed **6 *Essential* “Lists”** to remember for *optimal* ECG and arrhythmia interpretation. The purpose of a “List” *— *is that it readily recalls the most common/important entities to remember for the particular entity.\n\n+ We have already covered the first 5 of these Lists. \n+ For convenience *— *We ***consolidate*** all **6 Lists** in **Section 00.7** \\(*Make a bookmark — and/or Search for “00.7” to locate these 6 lists*\\). \n+ We present below in Section 10.47 our *last* list = **LIST \\#6**. \n\n \n\n**10.45 –* Normal* Appearance of the QRS in Lead V1 **\n\nAs emphasized in Sections 05 and 09 *— *the **QRS complex** in **lead V1** will be **predominantly *negative*** under normal circumstances. This is because this *right-sided* lead \\(*V1*\\) normally sees electrical activity as *moving away* from V1 \\(*or toward the large left ventricle*\\). This concept is illustrated in *schematic* **Figure 10.45-1**.\n\n+ The finding of predominant *positive* activity in lead V1 \\(*an R wave that equals or exceeds the S wave in this right-sided lead*\\) *— *is *not* “normal”. This is the premise on which our List \\#6 is based \\(*Section 10.46*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.45-1:** Transverse \\(*cross-sectional*\\) view of the heart — illustrating *precordial* lead appearance in leads V1-through-V6 \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.3-1\\). Transition occurs in the above Figure *between* lead V2-to-V4. Note that the **QRS complex** in **lead V1** is ***predominantly* negative** under normal circumstances \\(*red box*\\). Septal depolarization normally moves left-to-right \\(*small black arrow*\\). The major component of ventricular activation moves to the left and posteriorly \\(*large red arrow*\\) — which reflects the relative size and anatomic position of the left ventricle. This explains why lead V1 normally sees predominant electrical activity as moving *away* from this *right-sided* lead.\n\n**10.46 – The *Purpose* of List \\#6 **\n\nIt is *easy* to overlook the finding of a tall \\(*or relatively tall*\\) R wave in lead V1. It is equally easy to overlook the finding of *early* transition — in which the R wave in precordial leads V2 or V3 becomes *disproportionately* tall much *sooner* than expected.\n\n+ The *KEY* to *not* overlooking the ECG findings of a *tall* R wave in lead V1 or *early* transition — is to *routinely* apply a ***systematic* approach** to your ECG interpretation. This is our purpose for including the **“R” *component*** \\(*looking for ****R Wave**** progression*\\) when assessing for **“**Q**-R-**S**-**T**” Changes** \\(*Section 00.6.6*\\). \n+ The purpose of our **LIST \\#6** — is to facilitate recall of the principal causes of a *disproportionately* tall R wave in lead V1 \\(*Section 10.47*\\). Awareness of these causes is especially important — because *computerized* ECG interpretations typically *fail* to pick up a *taller-than-expected* R wave in leads V1,V2,V3. \n\n \n\n**10.47 – LIST \\#6: *Causes of a Tall R Wave in Lead V1 ***\n\nIn **LIST \\#6** — We note 6 important causes of a tall R wave in lead V1. The best way *not* to overlook any of these causes — is to work through *each* of the entities on this list \\(**Figure 10.47-1**\\) whenever you recognize that the R wave in lead V1 is taller than you expect.\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.47-1:** The *Common* Causes of a *Tall* R Wave in Lead V1 = **LIST \\#6**. *Normal* variant is a diagnosis of exclusion \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Looking *Closer* at LIST \\#6:** The way to *narrow down* which of the entities on List \\#6 is likely to be operative — is to look for *associated* findings.\n\n+ **WPW** — Look for the QRS to be wide with *delta* waves and a *short* PR interval \\(*discussed in detail in Section 05.37*\\). \n+ **RBBB** — Look for the QRS complex to be wide with an rSR’ \\(*or equivalent*\\) in lead V1 and wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6 \\(*Section 05.4*\\). \n+ **RVH** — Look for ECG criteria of RVH including right or indeterminate axis; RAA \\(*Right Atrial Abnormality*\\); tall R wave in V1; RV “strain”; persistent precordial S waves \\(*Section 08.23*\\). \n+ ***Posterior* MI** — Look for ECG evidence of associated *inferior* infarction and for a *positive* “mirror test” \\(*Section 10.33*\\). \n+ **Cardiomyopathy** — increased *septal* forces from **HCM** \\(*Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy*\\) may manifest as a *disproportionately* tall R wave in lead V1 \\(*discussed in more detail in Section 10.49*\\). On occasion — *other* forms of cardiomyopathy \\(*such as that associated with muscular dystrophy*\\) may also result in a tall R wave in V1 \\(*Section 10.65*\\). \n+ ***Normal* Variant** — to be considered only *after* the above 5 causes have been *ruled out. *Thus, the diagnosis of ***“normal variant”*** as the reason for a disproportionately *tall* R wave in lead V1 — is a diagnosis of exclusion\\! \n\n \n\n**10.48 – PRACTICE Tracings: *The Cause of the Tall R in V1? ***\n\nAs PRACTICE in *clinical* application of List \\#6 — We present the following 5 *schematic* tracings and the real tracing in Figure 10.50-1:\n\n+ For *each* tracing — the rhythm is sinus and a ***tall* R wave** is seen in **lead V1**. Can you identify the *likely* cause of the *tall* R wave in lead V1 for *each* case? **HINT:** Feel free to refer back to **LIST \\#6** \\(*in* Figure 10.47-1\\) when formulating your answer. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-1:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is wide. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.48-1** The QRS is wide. A tall R wave with an RSR’ \\(*taller right rabbit ear*\\) pattern is seen in lead V1. There are wide terminal S waves in leads I,V6. The cause of the *tall* R in V1 = **RBBB** \\(*Section 05.4*\\).\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-2:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is wide. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.48-2:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is wide. The PR interval is *short* and there is initial *slurring* of the QRS upslope in the form of a ***delta* wave** in multiple leads. The cause of the *tall* R in V1 = **WPW** \\(*Section 05.37*\\).\n\n+ Note how this *schematic* example of WPW *simulates* RBBB in V1 — and *simulates* LBBB in leads I,V6. Remember — *delta* waves will *not* always be seen in all leads. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-3:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is narrow. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.48-3:** The rhythm is sinus and the QRS complex is narrow. The cause of the *tall* R in V1 = **RVH** \\(*Section 08.23*\\). Note the following features in support of this diagnosis:\n\n+ RAD \\(*Right Axis Deviation*\\) — as determined by the markedly *negative* QRS complex in lead I. \n+ RAA \\(*Right Atrial Abnormality*\\) — as determined by tall, peaked and pointed P waves in leads II,III,aVF. \n+ RV “strain” in lead V1 — as suggested by ST-T wave depression in V1 that occurs in association with the tall R wave in this lead. \n+ Persistent *precordial* S waves — as suggested by the deep S wave that is still present in lead V6. \n+ ***KEY* Point:** Remember to think of RVH as the ***“detective” *diagnosis** that is generally made by a *combination* of ECG findings that occur in the *right* clinical setting \\(*Section 08.24*\\). \n+ Practically speaking — By the time one sees as many ECG indicators of RVH in an *adult* as are present in *schematic* Figure 10.48-3 — the patient has either: **i\\)** *end-stage* pulmonary disease; and/or **ii\\)** pulmonary hypertension. \n+ **NOTE:** The finding of a relatively *tall* R wave in lead V1 is much *more* common in children — where it is *not* necessarily abnormal during the first few years of life \\(*Section 08.31*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-4:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is narrow. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.48-4:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS complex is narrow. There are small *inferior* Q waves and *marked* ST elevation consistent with **acute *inferior* MI.** ST depression is seen in leads I and in *anterior* leads V1,V2,V3. There is a **positive *“mirror test”*** \\(*See below in* **Figure 10.48-5**\\).\n\n+ **Impression:** We suspect the *tall* R in V1 is due to **acute *posterior* MI**. That said — the *other* 2 causes of *anterior* ST depression in LIST \\#5 may also be contributing \\(**Figure 10.42-2**\\). As emphasized in **LIST \\#5** — ST depression in leads V1,V2,V3 that occurs in association with acute *inferior* MI may be due to: **i\\)** *posterior* MI; **ii\\)** *reciprocal* ST depression \\(*in response to the acute inferior infarction*\\); and/or **iii\\)** *anterior* ischemia. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-5:** Application of the *“mirror”* test to the *schematic* tracing shown in Figure 10.48-4. The **postive *“mirror”* test** supports **acute *posterior* MI** as at least one of the causes of the *tall* R wave in lead V1 of Figure 10.48-4.\n\nFinally — Consider the *schematic* tracing shown in **Figure 10.48-6**. The patient was an *asymptomatic* and otherwise healthy young adult. The ECG was obtained for screening purposes.\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.48-6:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS is narrow. The patient is an asymptomatic and otherwise healthy young adult. The ECG was obtained for screening purposes. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.48-6:** The rhythm is sinus. The QRS complex is narrow. We diagnose ***normal* variant** as the *likely* reason for the moderately *tall* R wave \\(*R=S*\\) in lead V1 — by the ***process* of elimination**. That is — the *other* causes in **List \\#6** must first be *ruled out*. We do this as follows:\n\n+ Since the QRS complex is *narrow *— the cause for the relatively *tall* R wave in lead V1 is *not* RBBB and *not* WPW. \n+ This is *not* posterior MI — because: **i\\)** the patient is an asymptomatic and healthy young adult; **ii\\)** there is no ECG evidence of inferior MI; and **iii\\)** the “mirror” test is not positive. \n+ This is *not* RVH — because: **i\\)** the axis is normal;** ii**\\) there is no RAA;** iii\\)** there is no RV “strain”; and **iv\\)** there is no persistent S wave in lead V6. \n+ Admittedly — We can *not* rule out **HCM** \\(*Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy*\\) without an Echocardiogram. This does *not* necessarily mean that one needs to obtain an Echo on all patients with an ECG such as seen in *schematic* Tracing 10.48-6. *Clinical judgement is needed*. IF this patient was an athlete competing in high intensity sports *and/or* had a heart murmur or *positive* family history of *early* sudden death — then an Echo is clearly indicated.

Although *not* overly common — HCM is an important potential cause of sudden death \\(*especially in young athletes*\\). **Echo** *is diagnostic\\!* On the other hand — **ECG findings** are highly variable. These may include a moderately *tall* R wave in lead V1 as shown in **Figure 10.48-6** — and which indicates prominent* septal *forces. It might also include deep septal Q waves; LVH by voltage; IVCD/ LBBB — or *no* ECG changes at all. The reason for emphasizing *awareness* of HCM is the risk of *sudden death* that HCM poses among previously healthy young adults. While cost concerns prohibit mass screening by Echo of all young adults — Echo is indicated when there is a history of syncope during exercise; with a *positive* family history for *early* sudden death; when a *non-innocent* murmur is heard — or when a *pre-participation* ECG reveals *abnormal* findings that may be consistent with the diagnosis.\n\n**10.50 – FIGURE 10.50-1: *WHY the Tall R in V1? ***\n\nWe conclude this segment on recognizing the cause of a disproportionately *tall* R wave in lead V1 — with the ECG shown in **Figure 10.50-1**. The patient is a middle-aged adult. No other clinical information is available. *What is the cause of the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.50-1:** ECG obtained from a middle-aged adult. No other clinical history is available. *Why the tall R wave in lead V1?*\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.50-1:** The QRS complex looks to be slightly wide. The rhythm appears to be sinus — as suggested by the presence of an upright P wave in lead II. The PR interval in lead II looks normal. The QT is not prolonged. The most remarkable finding on this tracing — is the **very *tall* R wave** in **lead V1**. This is clearly *not* expected — and should prompt consideration of the 6 entities in **LIST \\#6** as a possible explanation. We suspect that the answer will probably *also* explain: **i\\)** the marked left axis \\(*and/or QS complex in inferior leads*\\); and **ii\\)** ST flattening and shallow T inversion seen in multiple leads. As we work through the entities on List \\#6 — We note the following:\n\n+ This is *not* a “normal variant” tracing. Other than the tall R wave in lead V1 — there is really nothing to suggest RVH \\(*no right axis; no RAA; no RV “strain” in lead V1*\\). And although it almost looks as if there are inferior Q waves — this is not the usual picture of inferior infarction, and the “mirror test” is *not* suggestive of posterior infarction. \n+ Finally — the patient does *not* have RBBB. There is no rSR’ in lead V1 — and no S wave is seen in lead I. The QRS complex is also not as wide as is generally seen with bundle branch block. \n+ The patient has **WPW**\\! It is important to appreciate that the QRS complex is *not* always overly wide with WPW. This is because there may occasionally be *simultaneous* conduction down *both* normal and accessory pathway — which will result in only *partial* pre-excitation \\(*Section 05.38*\\). It is *because of* awareness of **LIST \\#6** — that one looks *extra hard* for ***delta* waves** whenever the finding of a tall R wave in V1 is seen. Close inspection reveals such delta waves are seen \\(*red and blue arrows in* **Figure 10.50-2**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.50-2:** Arrows highlight delta waves that were subtly present in the ECG shown in Figure 10.50-1. The QRS complex with WPW will *not* always be overly wide — as there may only be *partial* pre-excitation \\(*if impulses are simultaneously conducted down normal and accessory pathway*\\). Although the PR interval looks to be normal in lead II of this tracing — it appears to be *short* in leads V4,V5,V6 \\(*red arrows in these leads*\\). ***Delta* waves** *are* present. They are *negative* in the inferior leads \\(*blue arrows*\\) — and *positive* in other leads in which they are seen \\(*red arrows*\\). No delta wave is evident in leads aVR, aVL or V2.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.51 –* Giant* T Wave Syndrome **\n\n\n\nWe have already discussed on a number of occasions ECG recognition and clinical implications of T wave inversion. When **T waves** are ***symmetrically* inverted** \\(*as they are in* **Figure 10.51-1**\\) — the possibility of **ischemia** should be strongly considered.\n\n+ Depending on the history — ***other* entities** might also account for the *symmetric* T wave inversion seen in Figure 10.51-1. For example, this could be due to ***acute* pulmonary embolus** — IF the patient experienced *sudden* shortness of breath \\(*Section 08.37*\\). It could even be a ***normal* variant** \\(*Juvenile T wave pattern*\\) — IF the patient in question was an otherwise healthy and asymptomatic child \\(*Section 08.31*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.51-1:** *Schematic* ECG illustrating ***symmetric* T wave inversion** in the *anterior* leads \\(*red arrows in leads V2,V3,V4*\\). This ECG picture should suggest ischemia — although depending on the history, *other* causes might also be considered \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**10.52 –* When Inverted T Waves are GIANT in Size\\! ***\n\nAlthough *some* T wave inversion is a common ECG finding — the occurrence of truly *huge* T waves that are inverted in *multiple* leads is much less often seen. We reserve the term, ***“Giant T Wave Syndrome”*** — for a *select* number of clinical entities that produce ***truly* deep** \\(\u003e*5mm amplitude*\\)** T wave inversion**. An example of this phenomenon is shown in **Figure 10.52-1**:\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.52-1:** Sinus bradycardia with ***Giant* T Wave Inversion** that is present in *multiple* leads. As suggested by the *blow-up* insert — T waves *exceed* 10mm in size. A number of potential clinical causes should be considered \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Causes of *Giant* T Wave Inversion:** Think of the following **6 entities** when you see truly *“giant inverted T waves”* in *multiple* leads:\n\n+ Apical \\(*Yamaguchi*\\) Cardiomyopathy. \n+ *Severe* CNS disorders \\(*increased intracranial pressure*\\). \n+ Stokes-Adams attacks \\(*especially when due to severe bradycardia/complete AV block*\\). \n+ Anterior ischemia/coronary artery disease. \n+ *Post-Tachycardia* Syndrome. \n+ *Massive* Pulmonary Embolism \\(*acute right heart strain*\\). \n\n \n\n**Taking a *Closer* Look at the Causes:** We highlight the following clinical points regarding the 6 common causes of *Giant* T Waves:\n\n+ *Giant *T waves were first described in association with ***Stokes-Adams* attacks** — in which patients presented with *syncope* from *complete* AV block/bradycardia. \n+ The most *bizarre* ECG changes occur with ***severe* CNS disorders** \\(*stroke, subarachnoid or intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, coma, brain tumors, trauma*\\). Often — the QT interval will be prolonged \\(*sometimes markedly so*\\) with CNS catastrophes. In addition to *giant* T waves — there may be *marked* ST elevation that *mimics* acute MI. \n+ **Apical** \\(*Yamaguchi*\\) **Cardiomyopathy** — is a special form of HCM \\(*Hypertrophic CardioMyopathy*\\) in which the left ventricular apex is disproportionately involved. *Giant* T waves are highly characteristic. Although Echo is the diagnostic procedure of choice for detecting HCM \\(*Section 10.49*\\) — localized *apical* thickening may occasionally be *missed* by Echo \\(*and only picked up by MRI scanning*\\). \n+ Deep, symmetric ***anterior* T wave inversion** — may suggest ***coronary* ischemia** from LAD \\(*Left Anterior Descending*\\) narrowing/occlusion \\(*Section 10.40.7*\\). Usually *other* clues in history \\(*chest pain*\\) or the ECG will be present — but on occasion, the diagnosis \\(*and indication to perform cardiac cath*\\) will *only* be forthcoming from *incidental* recognition of *giant* T waves. \n+ ***Post-Tachycardia* Syndrome** \\(*as its name implies*\\) — follows an episode of *sustained* tachycardia. This is a *transient* phenomenon after SVT or VT that does *not* indicate infarction. Usually T waves are *not* overly deep. \n+ Finally — *anterior *T inversion may suggest acute RV “strain” and be a sign of **acute *pulmonary* embolism** \\(*Section 08.37*\\). The history should suggest *acute* PE; there should be *other* ECG signs \\(*right axis; RAA; fast rate; tall R in V1*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.53 – FIGURE 10.53-1: *Cause of the Giant T Waves?***\n\nReturn to the ECG that was shown in Figure 10.52-1 \\(*which we reproduce below in* **Figure 10.53-1**\\). IF told that the patient is an older adult who was found unresponsive — *Which* causes of ***Giant* T Wave Inversion** should be most strongly considered?\n\n\n\n**Figure 10.53-1:** Sinus bradycardia with ***Giant* T Wave Inversion** that is present in *multiple* leads \\(*reproduced from* Figure 10.52-1\\). The patient is an older adult who was found unresponsive. What is the likely cause\\(s\\) of the *giant* inverted T waves? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.53-1:** The rhythm is sinus bradycardia. There is *marked* increase in QRS amplitude with *disproportionately* tall R waves in leads V1,V2,V3. Regarding ST-T wave changes:\n\n+ There is ***Giant* T Wave Inversion** — with *depth* of these inverted T waves easily *exceeding* 5mm in multiple leads. \n+ There is **ST segment coving** in several leads \\(*V2,V3,V4*\\) — albeit no significant ST segment elevation. There appears to be ***slight* J-point ST depression** in most of the leads that manifest T wave inversion. \n+ The **QT interval** appears to be *no more* than ***slightly* prolonged**. We measure the *actual* QT at over 0.50 milliseconds \\(*more than 2.5 large boxes in duration in lead V3*\\) — but given marked bradycardia, the QTc is really *not* overly long. \n\n \n\n**IMPRESSION:** *All* of the entities discussed in **Section 10.52** should be considered as possible *contributing* causes of the *Giant* T Wave Inversion seen in **Figure 10.53-1**:\n\n+ This older adult has ***definite* LVH** \\(*marked increase in QRS amplitude; ST-T wave abnormalities consistent with “strain” and/or ischemia*\\). Echo \\(*and possibly MRI*\\) would be needed to determine IF the patient had ***Yamaguchi*** \\(*Apical*\\) **Cardiomyopathy**. \n+ Deep *symmetric* T inversion should always suggest **ischemia** — which may well be due to significant narrowing of the LAD. This would be more likely IF there was a history of chest pain prior to becoming unresponsive. \n+ Given this patient’s ***unresponsive* state** — the possibility of a **CNS catastrophe** \\(*stroke; bleed; trauma; post-seizure; metabolic disturbance*\\) needs to be strongly considered. That said — the QT interval will typically be *profoundly* prolonged when the cause of giant T waves is a CNS catastrophe, whereas the QTc in this case is *no more* than slightly prolonged. \n+ We have *no idea* if this patient’s unresponsive state *could have been* preceded by an episode of ventricular tachycardia or a Stokes-Adams attack resulting from profound bradycardia with AV block. \n+ Finally — *massive* pulmonary embolism may sometimes present with an unresponsive state, and could produce the giant T waves seen here. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** All 6 entities listed in Section 10.52 should to be considered as possible cause of the *Giant* T Waves in Figure 10.53-1. Additional work-up will be needed to determine which cause\\(s\\) is likely to be operative in this case. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.54 – *Wellens’ *Syndrome**\n\n\n\nThere are a number of instances in ECG interpretation — in which a particular ECG pattern correlates strongly with a *specific* anatomic entity. Perhaps the most important clinical examples of this phenomenon are: **i\\)** Wellens’ Syndrome; and **ii\\)** DeWinter T waves:\n\n+ We address ECG recognition and clinical implications of **Wellens’ Syndrome** below in Sections 10.55 and 10.56. \n+ Recognition of DeWinter T waves is addressed in Section 10.57. \n\n \n\n**10.55 – *Wellens’ *Syndrome: *Clinical Implications \u0026 ECG Recognition***\n\nIn a small but *significant* percentage of patients who present with ischemic heart disease — the *initial* ECG may be *strongly* suggestive of a nearly \\(*but not totally*\\) occlusive pattern. ***Prompt* recognition** is essential in such cases — and may prove invaluable as a myocardial *sparing* and potential *life-saving* measure.\n\n+ Consider the ECG shown in **Figure 10.55-1** — obtained from a patient with *intermittent* chest discomfort. How would you interpret this ECG? \n+ What intervention is needed? \n+ What *anatomic* lesion is suggested? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.55-1:** *Wellens’ *Syndrome. This patient had *intermittent* chest pain. What intervention is needed? What *anatomic* lesion is suggested?\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.55-1:** First introduced by Wellens and his group in 1982 — the ECG pattern seen in Figure 10.55-1 has been found to be ***highly* predictive** \\(*with* ~*90% accuracy*\\) of ***critical *narrowing** in the ***proximal* LAD** \\(*Left-Anterior Descending*\\).\n\n+ Identification of this ECG pattern \\(*known as* ***Wellens’ *Syndrome**\\) — is indication for ***prompt* cardiac catheterization** — with expectation that ***revascularization*** will ***likely*** be **needed**. \n\n \n\nWe highlight the following *KEY* ***Clinical*** and **ECG Features** of **Wellens’ Syndrome**:\n\n+ There is a history of *prior* angina or chest discomfort. \n+ There is little or no elevation of cardiac markers \\(*troponins*\\). \n+ *No* pathologic precordial Q waves. \n+ Slight \\(*but not marked*\\) ST elevation in *precordial* leads. \n+ Progressive and *symmetric* T wave inversion that may be diffuse \\(*especially in precordial leads*\\). \n+ A characteristic ***abrupt* takeoff** \\(*steep angle*\\) to the ***deep* T wave inversion** that is seen in **leads V2,V3** *and/or* **V4**. \n\n \n\n***KEY Clinical *Point:** The importance of recognizing the above features of Wellens’ Syndrome — is that there is a very ***high* incidence** among these *symptomatic* patients who have *not yet* infarcted \\(*no more than minimal troponin elevation; no significant Q waves; minimal ST elevation*\\) — of going on to develop ***extensive* infarction** IF they do *not* undergo prompt revascularization.\n\n**FIGURE 10.55-1: *What Features are Seen in this Case?*** The ECG shown in Figure 10.55-1 *strongly* suggests ***Wellens’* Syndrome**. We note the following findings:\n\n+ There is a history of *intermittent* symptoms \\(*chest pain*\\). \n+ There is **slight** \\(*but not marked*\\) **ST elevation** in *anterior* leads V2,V3,V4 \\(*and perhaps also in lead V1*\\). \n+ The ST segment in these leads is straightened \\(*with a hint of downward coving in V3,V4*\\). \n+ Given this *slight* ST elevation in leads V2,V3 — the ***downward* slope** of the **T wave inversion** to follow in these leads is ***remarkably* steep**\\! \n+ There is *not yet* sign of definite infarction \\(*no Q wave in leads V2,V3,V4*\\). \n+ ***Clinical* Course:** This patient was found to have a \u003e95% *proximal* LAD lesion. He was stented with excellent result \\(**Figure 10.55-2**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.55-2:** Cath films *“Before”* and *“After”* stenting the tight *proximal* LAD lesion from the patient whose Wellens’ Syndrome ECG was shown in Figure 10.55-1. \\(Acknowledgement: *My appreciation to Jason Roediger for contributing this case, including the ECG and cath films*\\).\n\n**10.56 – FIGURE 10.56-1: *What Wellens’ Syndrome is Not\\!***\n\nThere are 2 ECG patterns that have been associated in the literature as representing *“Wellens’* Syndrome”. We favor use of *only* one of these patterns to define the syndrome \\(**Figure 10.56-1**\\):\n\n+ Many clinicians interpret the pattern of **symmetric* anterior *T wave inversion ***as* one expression of *Wellens’* Syndrome \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 10.56-1\\). We feel this is a mistake that *defeats* the goal of recognizing this syndrome. \n+ While anterior *symmetric* T inversion \\(*as seen in* **Panel A** *of* Figure 10.56-1\\) clearly *does* occur in patients with ischemic heart disease — seeing this pattern on ECG *without* slight ST elevation and the ***steep* T wave downslope** in **Panel B** is simply *not* nearly as predictive of a proximal *critical* LAD lesion. Instead — patients who *only* manifest the *symmetric* T inversion of **Panel A** *might* have: **i\\)** milder \\(*non-critical*\\) coronary disease, which could be in *any* part of the LAD \\(*not necessarily the proximal LAD*\\); **ii\\)** any of the *other* causes of T wave inversion that were listed in Section 10.52; or **iii\\)** *no* heart disease at all. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.56-1:** The ECG finding of *symmetric* anterior T wave inversion \\(*as schematically shown in* **Panel A**\\) — is *not* specific for a *proximal* LAD lesion. In contrast — the pattern seen in **Panel B** which shows slight ST elevation *with* a ***steep* T wave downslope** is *highly* specific for a critical ***proximal* LAD lesion**. OUR Preference: While fully acknowledging that *some* patients who manifest the T inversion pattern of Panel A will have coronary disease — We favor *reserving* the term, ***“Wellens’ Syndrome”*** for the ECG picture in **Panel B**, which in a *symptomatic* patient is *much more* specific for a proximal *critical* LAD narrowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.57 –* DeWinter *T Waves**\n\n\n\nIn follow-up to Wellens’ Syndrome \\(*Section 10.54*\\) — the 2nd ECG pattern we highlight as being *highly* specific for the presence of a **critical *proximal* LAD narrowing** — is the presence of DeWinter T waves.\n\n+ Recognition of ***DeWinter* T waves** — is mandate for *immediate* intervention \\(*cardiac catheterization/acute reperfusion*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.58 – ECG Recognition:* What are DeWinter T Waves?***\n\nAwareness of the relatively uncommon but highly characteristic DeWinter T wave sign is essential for *not* overlooking the *approximate* **2%** of **acute *anterior* MI** patients who present with this ECG manifestation \\(*DeWinter,Wellens,Wilde: NEJM 359: 2071, 2008*\\).\n\n+ Rather than frank ST elevation that usually accompanies *acute* LAD occlusion — there is instead the unique ***DeWinter* complex**, with ***upsloping* J-point ST depression** *blending* into ***very* tall** upright ***hyperacute* T waves** in usually *several* of the precordial leads \\(*red arrows in leads V2,V3 of* **Figure 10-58.1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.58-1:** *Schematic* ECG from a hypothetical patient with *new-onset* chest pain. ***DeWinter* T waves** are seen in several of the precordial leads \\(*especially V2,V3 — but also lead V4*\\). Note disproportionately ***tall* upright** \\(*hyperacute*\\) **T waves** that arise from the *characteristic* **J-point ST depression** \\(*red arrows in V2,V3*\\). An encouraging sign that infarction has *not* yet taken place — is the presence of r waves with *appropriate* r wave progression in the anterior leads \\(*transition is slightly delayed — but the r wave does get progressively taller as one moves from lead V1-to-V4*\\). Prompt catheterization and reperfusion is essential\\!\n\n**10.59 – *DeWinter* T Waves:* Clinical Characteristics***\n\nWe emphasize the following key points about patients who present with chest pain and DeWinter T waves on ECG:\n\n+ Recognition of ***DeWinter* T waves** in patients with ***new-onset* chest pain** — is *highly* correlated with the finding of acute *proximal* **LAD** *critical* stenosis on cardiac catheterization. \n+ Rather than evolution of tall, peaked \\(*hyperacute*\\) T waves into frank ST segment elevation — the *DeWinter* T wave pattern is often surprisingly *static* over the ensuing few hours. \n+ *None* of the patients in the DeWinter series who manifested this ST-T wave pattern had acute left main occlusion on catheterization \\(*NEJM 359: 2071, 2008*\\). Thus, the DeWinter T wave complex appears ***highly* specific** for ***proximal* LAD stenosis** \\(*and not for a left main lesion*\\). \n+ *Despite *prompt recognition and intervention — a significant percentage of patients developed *positive* cardiac markers for acute infarction. One ECG sign that infarction may have *already* occurred — is development of an ***anterior* QS** wave or ***loss*** of **r wave amplitude** \\(*See* Figure 10.60-1 *below*\\). \n\n \n\n**10.60 – FIGURE 10.60-1:* What is the “Culprit” Artery?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown in Figure 10.60-1 — obtained from a patient who presented to the ED with *new-onset* chest pain. \n\n+ Should the cath lab be activated for *acute* STEMI? \n+ IF so — What do you suspect the ***“culprit”* artery** is likely to be? \n+ How *many* ECG signs are present in **Figure 10.60-1** to support your clinical impression? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.60-1:** ECG obtained from a patient with *new-onset* chest pain.

All intervals and the axis are normal. There is no chamber enlargement. There are however, a series of *alarming* findings that were recognized by the emergency team. Cardiac catheterization was performed *within* 15 minutes after this patient walked into the ED — with successful reperfusion of a **100% *proximal* LAD occlusion**. Clues to the need for *immediate* catheterization and clues indicating localization of the *“culprit”* artery to the *proximal* LAD including the following:\n\n+ ***Hyperacute* T waves** in *multiple* leads. These are best seen in leads aVL; and in V2,V3,V4. \n+ ***DeWinter* T Waves** — Rather than frank ST elevation \\(*as is usually seen with acute anterior infarction*\\) — there is 1-to-3 mm of ***upsloping* J-point ST depression** in one or more *precordial* leads that *continue* into **tall, positive *symmetric* T waves** \\(*seen best in leads V3,V4 of *Figure 10.60-1\\). \n+ *Loss* of anterior R waves \\(*with reduction in R wave amplitude between leads V1-to-V2*\\). \n+ Marked inferior ***reciprocal* ST depression**. \n+ **ST elevation** in **leads aVR** *and* **V1**. \n+ *Incomplete* RBBB \\(*rSr’ in lead V1; narrow terminal S waves in leads I,V6*\\). \n\n \n\n***ECG* PEARLS:** In addition to precordial *DeWinter* T waves and loss of r wave between V1-to-V2 — there are a few ***more* signs** suggestive/consistent with an **acute *proximal* LAD lesion**.

First described by Sato et al in 1990 as a reversible form of cardiac dysfunction — the precise mechanism of this intriguing clinical entity remains elusive. It is still *all-too-commonly* overlooked as a potential etiology for what otherwise might constitute *difficult-to-explain* ECG and clinical findings.\n\n**10.62 – FIGURE 10.62-1: *Acute STEMI *— *or Something Else?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown in Figure 10.62-1 — which was obtained from an older woman with severe *abdominal* pain. *No chest pain*. Serial troponins were no more than *minimally* elevated. She presented with heart failure.\n\n+ How might you explain this clinical picture? \n+ How can *definitive* diagnosis be made? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.62-1:** ECG obtained from an older woman with abdominal pain and evidence of heart failure. *No chest pain*. How might you explain this clinical picture? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.62-1:** The rhythm is sinus at ~100/minute. The PR and QRS intervals appear to be normal — but the QT is prolonged \\(*clearly more than half the R-R interval*\\). The axis is normal \\(*\\+70 degrees*\\). No chamber enlargement. An rSr’ complex is noted in lead V1.\n\n+ Assessment of **Q-R-S-T Changes** — is remarkable for the presence of ***inferior* Q waves** — normal transition \\(*R wave becoming taller than the S wave between leads V3-to-V4*\\) — and **ST segment *coving*** with ***marked* ST elevation** in the ***inferior* leads**. This is accompanied by ***deep* T wave inversion**. Similar abnormal ST segment coving and elevation \\(*albeit not as marked*\\) is *also* present in **leads V4,V5**. Deep, *symmetric* T wave inversion that begins in lead V3 is seen in V4,V5. *Reciprocal* ST depression is seen in lead aVL, and to a lesser extent in V1,V2. \n\n \n\n**Impression:** Despite the absence of chest pain — the initial interpretation of this ECG was “probable *acute* STEMI \\(*ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\) in need of immediate cardiac catheterization for possible reperfusion”. After all — there are Q waves, ST segment coving and elevation, deep T wave inversion — and *reciprocal* ST depression. Acute RCA occlusion vs an LAD *“wrap-around”* lesion was suspected. However, cardiac catheterization revealed ***normal* coronary arteries**\\!\n\n+ Instead of acute infarction — the ***ventriculogram*** revealed the diagnostic picture of apical ballooning *with* hypercontractility of the cardiac base that is characteristic of ***Takotsubo* Cardiomyopathy**. The patient was treated supportively with recovery of left ventricular function over the next few weeks. \n\n \n\n**10.63 – *Takotsubo* CMP: *Clinical Features***\n\n*Takotsubo* CMP \\(*CardioMyoPathy*\\) is an *underappreciated* cause of acute ECG abnormalities that are often accompanied by a degree of *new-onset* heart failure:\n\n+ First described in Japan in 1990 — the entity derives its name from a specially designed container used by Japanese fishermen to trap octopuses. The unusual *round* bottom and *narrow* neck design of **takotsubo** resembles the diagnostic picture on cardiac catheterization obtained as a result of *ballooning* of the cardiac apex with *hypercontraction* of the base \\(**Figure 10.63-1**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.63-1:** Collection of actual takotsubo showing the round bottom and narrow neck — that resembles the *diagnostic* picture seen on the cardiac catheterization **ventriculogram** \\(*shown here during end-systole*\\). Note characteristic *“ballooning”* of the apex and *hypercontractility* of the base during cardiac cath \\(*See text*\\).\n\nThe precise **mechanism** for Takotsubo CMP remains elusive. While factors such as coronary spasm; disturbance of the microcirculation; coronary artery anatomic variation; and neurogenic myocardial stunning have all been implicated — their role is uncertain. What has been shown — is that ***abnormal* response** to an ***increase*** in ***endogenous* catecholamines** is almost always involved. Blood epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are *unmistakably* elevated \\(*sometimes dramatically*\\) in patients with Takotsubo CMP.\n\n+ In addition — there is *more-than-coincidental* ***preceding* occurrence** of ***intense* situational** or ***psychological* stress** in many patients. This may be in the form of severe ***emotional*** stress \\(*death of a loved one; break-up from significant other; overwhelming anxiety/depression*\\) — **pain** — *and/or* **fear** \\(*from earthquake or other catastrophic event*\\). It is easy to understand the rationale for *other* names that have been used for this syndrome \\(ie, ***“Stress”* Cardiomyopathy** or ***“Broken-Heart”* syndrome**\\). \n+ Although consensus is still lacking regarding specific criteria for defining Takotsubo CMP — there is general agreement that ***cardiac* cath** is **diagnostic** \\(ie, *apical ballooning *but* no “culprit” artery*\\). \n\n \n\n**SUMMARY of the *Clinical* Picture:** Takotsubo CMP is most typically seen in an *older* patient \\(*most often in a post-menopausal woman*\\) — who presents with chest pain or *new* heart failure. Look for the following features:\n\n+ Likelihood of *preceding* severe *physical/emotional* stress. \n+ **Markedly *abnormal* initial ECG** — often with diffuse ST elevation in *inferior* and *antero-lateral* leads \\(*apical or LAD ‘wraparound’ distribution*\\). Associated T wave inversion *and/or* Q waves \\(*sometimes deep*\\) may be seen. Acute extensive *STEMI-in-evolution* is frequently the *initial* diagnosis \\(*as was the case in* Figure 10.62-1\\). \n+ Usually *no more* than ***modest* troponin elevation** \\(*troponins are often elevated — *but* generally not nearly as high as expected given how marked ECG changes are*\\). \n+ ***Transient* LV dysfunction** — which may be *severe* initially \\(*some patients present in pulmonary edema/cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump support*\\). LV function *usually* resolves *within* a *few* weeks. \n+ Possibility of potentially *life-threatening* arrhythmias during the acute phase \\(*including VT/Torsades de Pointes*\\). \n+ *Absence* of pheochromocytoma, myocarditis or *other* underlying cardiac pathology to explain findings. \n+ **Generally *favorable* prognosis** \\(*often with full recovery within 1 month*\\) — but fatalities have been reported \\(*from LV free wall rupture; intractable pulmonary edema*\\). \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Variations on the above theme *do* exist. The syndrome of Takotsubo CMP is *not* limited to post-menopausal women — the ECG does *not* always show marked abnormality — and severe stress does *not* uniformly precede presentation.\n\n+ Anatomic areas *other than* the apex may also be affected. For example — there may be an ***“inverted takotsubo”* form**, in which the apex is spared but the *base* of the heart is hypokinetic. The existence of such Takotsubo variants helps to explain the likely multifactorial etiology to this interesting syndrome. \n\n \n\n**Final* Clinical* PEARL:** Think of the possibility of Takotsubo CMP when confronted with a patient who presents with a **markedly *abnormal* ECG** that ***doesn’t quite “fit”*** the clinical picture.\n\n+ ECG findings may be *out of proportion* to clinical findings. ECG changes may involve several lead areas \\(*especially inferior *and* anterior precordial leads — which typically assess the cardiac apex*\\). \n+ There may be an element of heart failure. Serum troponins may be positive. \n+ The patient is usually an older adult \\(*especially a post-menopausal woman*\\). \n+ There has usually been some form of severe *preceding* “stress”. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**10.64 – *Muscular* Dystrophy**\n\n\n\nAmong *non-ischemic* etiologies for markedly ***abnormal* ECGs** in young individuals — is the series of ***muscular* dystrophies**. The best known and most common of these is ***Duchenne* M**uscular **D**ystrophy \\(**DMD**\\) — but there are more than 20 different genetic forms of these rare muscular dystrophy disorders. DMD occurs in ~1/3,000 boys \\(*it is an X-linked disorder*\\) — with unfortunate outcome of progressive muscle deterioration leading to death at an early age.\n\n+ Among the many other forms of muscular dystrophy is ***Becker* M**uscular **D**ystrophy \\(**BMD**\\) — which is felt to be a *less* severe form than DMD. There are similarities among the different forms of muscular dystrophy \\(*re being genetic defects leading to progressive muscle weakness/deterioration*\\) — though variations exist depending on muscle groups affected and prognosis. \n+ The defect in DMD is the absence of a critical muscle protein \\(*ergo rather than “dystrophy” *—* it is really a myopathy*\\). \n+ Symptoms of DMD typically begin before age 5 \\(*sometimes in infancy*\\). The boy with DMD will lag in development. He may be clumsy, unbalanced, weaker and easily prone to fatigue. \n+ “Pseudohypertrophy” \\(*enlargement of calf and deltoid muscles*\\) occurs — and may be an early sign \\(*due to replacement of injured muscle cells by fibrous or scar tissue*\\). \n+ Progressive muscle weakness develops — beginning proximally \\(*legs, pelvis*\\) before spreading to other areas. \n+ Diagnosis of DMD \\(*and other muscular dystrophies*\\) is suspected by increased CK levels on lab testing — and confirmed by muscle biopsy and genetic testing. \n+ ***DMD is uniformly fatal.*** The disorder is progressive and ultimately affects all voluntary muscles. The heart and respiratory muscle groups are typically affected by the teens. Myocardial deterioration \\(*cardiomyopathy*\\) and respiratory failure represent the major threat to life. There is no cure \\(*most boys die before age 25*\\). \n+ Prognosis in *other* forms of muscular dystrophy is *not* necessarily uniformly fatal as it is in DMD. Cardiac involvement \\(*and ECG changes*\\) are common in many \\(*but not all*\\) of these other forms. Females may be affected in some of the other forms. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** It is well to be aware of the group of muscular dystrophies as one of the causes of a **markedly *abnormal* ECG** in a ***young* adult** \\(*especially in males*\\). Given the variation in severity and presentation — the diagnosis of a form of muscular dystrophy might *not* always be known at the time an ECG is done. \n\n \n\n**10.65 – *Muscular* Dystrophy: *Common ECG Abnormalities***\n\nBy young adulthood — the ECG with DMD *\\(and with many other forms of muscular dystrophy*\\) will usually be abnormal. Among the **ECG abnormalities** that are commonly seen include the following:\n\n+ ***Abnormal* Q waves** *not* due to infarction. These are most often seen in *lateral* leads. \n+ Sinus tachycardia \\(*due to impaired cardiac function*\\). \n+ **RBBB** — that often manifests a peculiar **polyphasic rsr’** or rsr’s’ in lead V1. \n+ **Tall *anterior* R waves** — that may manifest surprisingly high amplitude. This may result in *early* transition or even as a *Tall* R in V1 \\(*Section 10.47*\\). \n+ *Other *conduction defects may be seen — including ***nonspecific* IVCD** with *unusual* QRS morphology. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** The ECG of a patient with muscular dystrophy may be markedly abnormal. This should be easy to understand given the genetic fault in muscle protein \\(*with replacement of myocardial tissue by fibrous and scar tissue*\\). This also explains the unusual array of ECG abnormalities and conduction defects that may be seen.\n\n**10.66 – FIGURE 10.66-1: *Abnormal ECG in a Young Subject***\n\nConsider the ECG shown below in Figure 10.66-1 — obtained from a 22-year old man in a wheelchair because of longterm disability and weakness. *No chest pain*.\n\n+ How would you interpret this ECG? \n+ Can you think of a clinical entity that might account for this clinical scenario? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.66-1:** 12-lead ECG obtained from a 22-year old man in a wheelchair with longterm disability. What medical diagnosis might explain this clinical scenario in association with this ECG?\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.66-1:** The ECG shows sinus rhythm at ~70/minute. The PR interval is normal — but the QRS is prolonged to *at least* 0.12 second. QRS morphology in the 3 key leads \\(*I,V1,V6*\\) is *not* consistent with either left or right bundle branch block. Therefore — We would classify the conduction defect as ***nonspecific* IVCD** \\(*IntraVentricular Conduction Delay*\\).\n\n+ Continuing with the interpretation — We note ***marked* LAD** \\(*Left Axis Deviation*\\) that is consistent with **LAHB** \\(*Left Anterior HemiBlock*\\) in view of the predominantly *negative* QRS complex in lead II. \n+ QRS amplitude is *markedly* increased in lead aVL — although reliability of the ECG diagnosis of **LVH** is reduced in the presence of conduction defects. \n+ Regarding **Q-R-S-T Changes** — there are deep and wide **Q waves** in the **high *lateral* leads** \\(*I,aVL*\\). In addition — there is a small q wave in lead V2. \n+ QRS morphology in **lead V1** is peculiar — as there is an **rSr’s’ complex**. This is followed by abrupt ***early* transition** that takes place between lead V1-to-V2. A *disproportionately* ***tall* R wave** is noted in **lead V2**. \n+ R wave amplitude drops off by lead V3 — with persistent S waves seen throughout the remaining precordial leads. \n+ There is **ST depression** in *lateral* leads I and aVL, which may reflect **LV* “strain” ***from suspected LVH. That said — ST-T wave changes do *not* appear to be acute. \n\n \n\n**IMPRESSION:** This ECG is clearly abnormal and highly *unusual* for a young adult. The diagnosis of a form of muscular dystrophy would explain *all* of the abnormalities seen \\(*Section 10.65*\\).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Dr. Harsha Nagarajarao for allowing me to use the case and ECG from the patient whose tracing is shown in Figure 10.66-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**10.67 – Hypothermia \\(*Osborn Wave*\\)**\n\n\n\nThe ***Osborn* Wave** — was first described in 1953 by JJ Osborn. The wave is commonly linked to ***hypothermia*** — but *other* entities \\(*including CNS injury and ventricular fibrillation*\\) may also be associated with it. A number of *other* names have been attributed to this ECG finding \\(*“camel-hump” sign; hypothermic wave; prominent J wave*\\).\n\n+ The ***Osborn* Wave** — is a *positive* deflection that occurs *just after* the QRS and at the *beginning* of the ST segment \\(**Figure 10.67-1**\\). \n+ Osborn waves are often *not* seen until the temperature drops *below* -32 degrees Centigrade \\(*=89.6 degrees Fahrenheit*\\). \n+ Other commonly ***associated* ECG features** with ***Hypothermia*** include: **i\\)** Bradycardia \\(*which may be marked*\\); **ii\\)** Atrial fibrillation; and **iii\\)** Artifact \\(*from baseline undulations resulting from associated shivering*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.67-1:** Osborn wave — highlighted by the *red* arrow. The ST segment is flat. Note fine undulations in the baseline that are commonly seen with hypothermia from associated shivering.\n\n**10.68 – FIGURE 10.68-1: *ECG Features of Hypothermia***\n\nConsider the ECG shown below in **Figure 10.68-1** — obtained from a homeless man who was stuporous and intoxicated when found in an open wet field.\n\n+ What would you guess this patient’s core temperature to be? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 10.68-1:** ECG obtained from a homeless man who was stuporous and intoxicated when found in an open wet field. Prominent ***Osborn* Waves** are noted in *multiple* leads \\(*blue arrows*\\). Note fine undulations in the baseline from *associated* shivering \\(*large red arrow in lead II rhythm strip*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 10.68-1:** There is ***baseline* artifact**. We suspect the rhythm is sinus based on what appear to be low amplitude P waves with a fixed PR interval in lead II \\(*and overall regularity of the rhythm*\\) — but it is difficult to be sure of atrial activity given the artifact. Frequent occurrence of atrial fibrillation in hypothermic patients is another potential reason for baseline undulations \\(*and another reason rhythm determination may be challenging*\\).\n\n+ ***Osborn* Waves** are present. These are *especially* marked in leads V3,V4,V5 \\(*blue arrows*\\) — in which they attain *at least* 5 mm in amplitude\\! Osborn waves are also seen to a lesser degree in leads V2 and V6. They may also be present \\(*hiding in the terminal portion of the QRS complex*\\) in the inferior leads — but the distinct notching of an Osborn wave is absent in these leads. \n+ Small inferior q waves are seen — but ST-T wave changes do *not* appear to be acute. \n+ T waves appear prominent and somewhat peaked in V3,V4,V5. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Correlation:** The patient’s core temperature on arrival was 30 degrees Centigrade \\(*86 degrees Fahrenheit*\\). Serum K\\+=7.3 mEq/L; arterial pH=6.89. Tremor \\(*producing baseline artifact as seen here*\\) is common in hypothermic patients. Of interest — Osborn waves resolved as the patient was warmed. Despite tropical location \\(*Costa Rica*\\) — this case illustrates that hypothermia may occur in warm weather places if predisposing circumstances are present \\(*in this case alcohol intoxication and poor choice of shelter*\\).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Leonardo Chacon for allowing me to use the case and ECG from the patient whose tracing is shown in Figure 10.68-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n**11.0 – Electrolyte Disorders**\n\n\n\nWith possible exception of hyperkalemia — an *“electrolyte disorder”* will rarely be the *primary* indication for obtaining an ECG. That said — the ECG may be of *definite* assistance in assessing *some* patients with *certain* types of electrolyte disorders, especially for explaining some of the ST-T wave abnormalities that may be seen. Consider the following:\n\n+ ***Potassium*** — There is a surprisingly ***good* correlation** between serum K\\+ \\(*potassium*\\) levels and the ECG when serum K\\+ is **elevated**. There are times when the ECG will be completed *before* blood results are back — strongly suggesting *not only* the diagnosis of hyperkalemia, but its *likely* severity \\(*and the need for immediate treatment even before serum value confirmation*\\). Unfortunately — correlation between serum levels and ECG changes is *poor* when serum K\\+ is normal or low \\(*Section 11.7*\\). \n+ ***Magnesium*** — is still *all-too-often* the *“forgotten”* cation. Hypomagnesemia is common when serum K\\+ is low. ***Low* serum Mg\\+\\+** \\(*magnesium*\\) **levels** produce virtually ***identical* ECG changes** as **hypokalemia** \\(*Section 11.8*\\). On the other hand — **Hypermagnesemia** usually does *not* produce ECG changes *until* serum Mg\\+\\+ levels are *markedly* increased \\(*usually \u003e8-10 mEq/L*\\) — at which time there may be bradycardia, *prolongation* of PR/QRS/ QT intervals *and/or* AV block. *Clinical* hypermagnesemia to this degree is distinctly uncommon in clinical practice *unless* there is renal failure *with* Mg\\+\\+ supplementation. \n+ ***Calcium*** — either in excess or deficiency, will *not* often produce *recognizable* effects on the ECG. That said — there *are* changes to look for: **i\\) Hypocalcemia** — typically *prolongs* the QT interval *without* affecting the subsequent ST segment; and **ii\\) Hypercalcemia** — may *shorten* the QT \\(*Section 11.1*\\). \n+ ***Other *Electrolyte Disorders** \\(*including abnormalities in serum Sodium and Phosphorus*\\) *— *in our experience do *not* produce any specific \\(*recognizable*\\) ECG picture. That said, there will often be *more* than a single electrolyte abnormality at a time *— *so *additive* effects are possible. \n\n \n\nIn this segment — We *limit* discussion and illustration of*** electrolyte-induced* ECG Changes** to the following:\n\n+ Calcium disorders — ***Section 11.1*.** \n+ Hyperkalemia — ***Section 11.3****.* \n+ Hypokalemia — ***Section 11.7****.* \n+ Hypomagnesemia — ***Section 11.8****.* \n+ Discussion of **U waves** — *Section 11.9*. \n\n \n\n**11.1 – CALCIUM: *ECG Changes of Hyper- \u0026 HypoCalcemia***\n\nAs noted above — it will *not* be often that you will be able to look at an ECG and say, *“These ECG changes are due to an excess or deficiency in serum Calcium”*. There are ***several* reasons** for this: **i\\)** ECG changes of hypo- and hypercalcemia are both *subtle* and often do *not* occur until excess or deficiency of this cation is marked; and **ii\\)** Calcium disorders are commonly associated with *other* metabolic *and/or* clinical problems. That said — it is still useful to be aware of the effect that Calcium disorders may have on the ECG. Consider the following:\n\n+ ***HypoCalcemia*** — typically ***prolongs*** the **QT interval**. As a result — a *low* serum Calcium level is one of the causes in our **LIST \\#3** for a ***long* QT** \\(*Section 06.2*\\). In theory — the ST segment is *not *affected by hypocalcemia, such that the T wave at the end of the *long* QT looks normal. This effect is *schematically* illustrated in **Figure 11.1-1** — in which compared to the situation when serum Calcium and the QT interval are *both* normal \\(**Panel A**\\) — a seemingly *unaltered* T wave is delayed in appearance by the *long* QT of hypocalcemia \\(**Panel B**\\). Clinically — the ECG picture seen in Panel B is typically *not* seen until serum calcium is *markedly* decreased. Even then, it may be difficult to distinguish the ECG effect of low serum calcium from that of other associated electrolyte disorders. ***Bottom* Line:** *Don’t expect* to recognize hypocalcemia on ECG. \n+ **Panel C** — Be aware that **Hypocalcemia** *and* **Hyperkalemia** may occur *together* in patients with renal failure. Clinically — this *combined* electrolyte disorder may occasionally be suspected by the ECG finding of peaked \\(*pointed*\\) T waves with *narrow* base that occur at the end of a *long* QT \\(Panel C *in* Figure 11.1-1\\). \n+ ***HyperCalcemia*** — may ***shorten*** the **QT interval**. That said — *Don’t expect* to see QT shortening *until* serum Ca\\+\\+ levels are *markedly* increased \\(*usually to more than 12mg/dL*\\). Even then *—* it will often be *exceedingly* difficult to distinguish between a QT interval that is normal \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 11.1-1\\) *—* vs a QT that is “short” with *early peaking* of the T wave \\(*as is theoretically seen with hypercalcemia — ***Panel D**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.1-1:** *Schematic* illustration of ECG changes with Calcium disorders. **Panel A** *— *the ST-T wave and the QT interval are *both* normal. **Panel B** *—*Hypocalcemia, which may lengthen the QT interval. The ST-T wave is otherwise unaffected. **Panel C** *— *Hypocalcemia *with* Hyperkalemia, as may occur with renal failure. The tall, peaked \\(*pointed*\\) T wave with *narrow* base of hyperkalemia *— *is *delayed* by the *long* QT of hypocalcemia. The preceding long ST segment is flat. **Panel D** *— *Hypercalcemia, which may *shorten* the QT \\(*with reduced time until T wave peaking*\\). Clinically *— *it is usually difficult to distinguish between a *normal* vs *short* QT interval \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**11.2 – Figure 11.2-1: *Acute STEMI or HyperCalcemia?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown below in Figure 11.2-1 *— *obtained from a 60-year old man being treated for *advanced* lung cancer. He presented to the ED \\(*Emergency Department*\\) with weakness and palpitations, but *no* chest pain.\n\n+ Should the cath lab be activated for *acute* STEMI? \n+ If so *—* what do you suspect the “culprit” artery is likely to be? \n+ Is *anything else* likely to be going on in **Figure 11.2-1** *— *in view of this clinical history? \n+ **HINT \\#1:** Be *systematic* in your interpretation \\(*including assessment of all intervals*\\). \n+ **HINT \\#2:** Feel free to *review* Section 11.1 that was just covered *before* formulating your answer. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.2-1:** ECG obtained from a 60-year-old man with lung cancer, weakness and palpitations *—* but *no* chest pain. Is this ECG diagnostic of an *acute* STEMI? Is *anything else* likely to be going on? \\(**HINT:** *Feel free to review Section 11.1 before formulating your answer*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 11.2-1:** The rhythm is sinus tachycardia. One PVC \\(*Premature Ventricular Contraction*\\) is seen \\(*the early wide-complex beat in simultaneously recorded leads V1,V2,V3*\\). The PR and QRS intervals are normal. The **QT interval** is ***difficult to assess*** given the tachycardia and lack of distinct end point of T wave inversion. The axis is normal at \\+70 degrees. No chamber enlargement.\n\n+ Regarding **Q-R-S-T Changes** *—* there are no definite q waves; transition is normal \\(*occurring between leads V2-to-V3*\\). The most remarkable finding relates to ST-T wave changes. \n+ There is ***coved* ST elevation** in *each* of the *inferior* leads \\(*II,III,aVF*\\) *—* and in *lateral* precordial leads \\(V4,V5,V6\\). In *each* of these leads, there appears to be **T wave *inversion*** following descent of the ST segment. \n+ There is ***reciprocal* ST depression** in leads aVL, V2, and to a lesser extent in lead V3. Lead V3 shows transition between the *flat* ST depression in lead V2 *—* and the ST coving and T wave inversion that begins in lead V4. \n\n \n\n***Initial* Impression:** The ECG in Figure 11.2-1 suggests ***acute* STEMI** \\(*ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction*\\) *—* in that there is *coved* ST elevation with T wave inversion and *reciprocal* ST depression. That said *—* there are **3 elements** about the history given and the ECG in **Figure 11.2-1** that should be cause for contemplation: **i\\)** There is no history of chest pain; **ii\\)** The patient has *advanced* lung cancer; and **iii\\)** The *shape* of the ST segment elevation is a bit “off” for acute STEMI.\n\n**KEY *Clinical* Point:** Despite *valid* concern about possible acute *infero-postero-lateral* STEMI \\(*either from a proximal right coronary vs dominant left circumflex occlusion*\\) *—* the *lack* of chest pain and *lack* of any defined *“onset”* of symptoms in the context of a patient with *advanced* cancer should prompt ***additional* data gathering** *prior to* cath lab mobilization.\n\n+ Initial serum troponins were negative. \n+ The patient was taken to the cath lab. *No* acute lesion and *no* significant coronary disease was found. \n+ While in the cath lab *— additional* lab values returned showing a *markedly* elevated ***serum* Calcium** value = **17 mg/dL**. \n+ *Comparison* ECGs were ultimately found. These were clearly abnormal. While a similar degree of ST elevation was *not* seen on prior tracings *—* there was definite ST segment coving with T wave inversion present on earlier tracings. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* SYNTHESIS:** This case is admittedly subtle and complex. It is clearly *beyond-the-core* for the beginning interpreter. Nevertheless *—* We feel it is an excellent teaching example for emphasizing a number of clinical points that *are* of interest for providers of any level. These include the following principles:\n\n+ **All ST segment elevation** is ***not* necessarily** the result of ***acute* coronary occlusion\\!** In addition to common *“other causes”* of ST elevation \\(ie, *early repolarization variants; LVH; acute pericarditis*\\) *—* chronic ST elevation may result from either ventricular aneurysm or cardiomyopathy. This case serves to remind that ***Hypercalcemia*** is yet another ***potential* STEMI-mimic**. \n+ Textbooks describe **QT interval *shortening*** as the principal ECG manifestation of **hypercalcemia**. That said *—* recognition that the QT interval is “short” is *not* easy to detect because: **i\\)** Usually *marked* hypercalcemia \\(*levels \u003e12.0 mg/dL*\\) are needed before the QT noticeably shortens; **ii\\)** it will often be difficult to distinguish clinically between a QT interval that is within the “normal” range vs one that is “too short”; and **iii\\)** ECG manifestations of hypercalcemia are *superimposed* on any baseline abnormalities that may be present. \n+ We mentioned that the ***shape*** of the **ST elevation** in this case was a bit “off” for *acute* STEMI. By this *—* we mean that the *coved* ST segments seemingly peak a tad *earlier* than is usually seen. That said *—* the *overall* QT interval in this case is *not* shortened. If anything *—* the overall QT interval is *lengthened* by *preexisting* T wave inversion that was seen to be present on *prior* comparison tracings. \n\n \n\n*BOTTOM* Line It is virtually ***impossible*** to ***attain* 100% accuracy** in knowing ***when*** to ***activate*** the ***cath* lab** based on assessment of a *single* initial ECG. Centers that boast an accuracy rate of 100% are clearly *missing* a certain percentage of *acute* MI patients who would probably benefit from early reperfusion.\n\n+ Occasional *false* activation of the cath lab is inevitable *— *and clearly *understandable* in this case given the ECG picture of ST elevation with T wave inversion and *reciprocal* ST depression. ***“Hindsight is 100% in the retrospectoscope”*** \\(Grauer *— circa 1980*\\). That said *—* the lesson to be learned is that the ECG is *not* a perfect tool *— *and the patient in this case gave *no* history of chest pain, and *no* defined onset of symptoms. There *are* times when *slight* delay before activating the cath lab is appropriate so that some *additional* evaluation can be performed. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Jiann Ruey Ong for allowing me to use the case and ECG from the patient whose tracing is shown in Figure 11.2-1.\n\n**11.3 – HYPERKALEMIA: *ECG Manifestations/Clinical Features ***\n\nThe ECG may prove invaluable in *expediting* recognition of clinically *important* hyperkalemia. This is because with Hyperkalemia *—* there is a surprisingly ***close* correlation** between ***serum* K\\+ levels** and **ECG** findings. We highlight this relationship in *schematic* Figure 11.3-1:\n\n+ **Panel A** — the serum K\\+ level is normal \\(*between ~3.5-5.0 mEq/L*\\). The QRS is of normal duration. The T wave is smooth. \n+ **Panel B** — shows *peaking* of the T wave, which is generally the *earliest* change of hyperkalemia \\(*K\\+ ~5.5-6.5 mEq/L*\\). This may initially be subtle. \n+ **Panel C** — The **T wave** becomes ***taller*** and ***more* peaked** \\(*K\\+ ~6.5-7.5 mEq/L*\\). With progressive hyperkalemia — the T wave takes on an ***“Eiffel Tower”*** appearance. Not only is the T wave tall and peaked — but it manifests a ***narrow* base** \\(*like the Eiffel Tower*\\). This is in contrast to the T wave that is sometimes seen in *healthy* individuals as a ***Normal* Variant** \\(*lower right insert within ***Figure 11.3-1**\\) — in which the T wave is rounded, its sides are *not *symmetric \\(*slower ascent than descent*\\) — and the T wave has a *broader* base \\(*Discussed momentarily in Section 11.6*\\). \n+ **Panel D —** P wave amplitude decreases; the PR interval lengthens — and the QRS widens \\(*K\\+ \u003e8 mEq/L*\\). Recognition of these ECG features signals potentially *life-threatening* hyperkalemia. \n+ **Panel E —** P waves often *disappear* at serum K\\+ levels \u003e8-9 mEq/L. Yet *despite no longer* seeing P waves on the surface ECG — the rhythm is *still* initiated by SA nodal impulses \\(***sinoventricular* rhythm**\\). The result may be a *wide*-QRS rhythm *without* P waves that is *still* supraventricular \\(*due to associated hyperkalemia* — *See Section 11.4*\\). Eventually \\(*at serum K\\+ levels \u003e9-10 mEq/L*\\) — the QRS complex becomes *sinusoid*. Ventricular fibrillation *and/or* asystole usually follow. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.3-1:** ECG Manifestations of ***Hyperkalemia***. Starting from a normal T wave \\(**Panel A**\\) *— *the T wave becomes progressively *taller* and more *peaked* from **Panel B** \\(*K\\+~5.5-6.5 mEq/L*\\) to **Panel C** \\(*K\\+~6.5-7.5 mEq/L*\\) as it takes on an *“Eiffel Tower”* appearance. **Panel D** *— *P wave amplitude decreases; the PR interval increases; the QRS widens \\(*K\\+\u003e8mEq/L*\\) *—* until the *pre-lethal* stage in **Panel E** \\(*K\\+\u003e8-9 mEq/L*\\) with *sinoventricular* rhythm \\(*P wave no longer seen*\\); marked QRS widening; and ultimately a *sinusoidal* pattern prior to VFib or asystole. Note the difference in shape between the T wave in Panel C *—* vs the ***Normal* Variant** pattern \\(*lower right insert — asymmetric T wave; rounder; with a wider base*\\).\n\n***Clinical* NOTE:** At the bedside *—* our *first* inclination when told of an *elevated* K\\+ level *—* is to ***validate*** the **reading** \\(*and rule out hemolysis*\\). We do this by ***repeating*** the **blood test**.\n\n+ At times — simply obtaining an **ECG** may be a ***faster*** way to determine IF there is cause for concern. The *absence* of ECG signs shown in Figure 11.3-1* —* suggests that serum K\\+ is probably *not* significantly elevated. \n\n \n\n***Increasing* Incidence of HyperKalemia:** Clinically *—* the incidence of Hyperkalemia continues to increase. This is *at least in part* because of the *increasing* number of patients on longterm dialysis.\n\n+ More patients have diabetes than ever before \\(*obesity epidemic in the general population*\\). These patients are living longer *— *so *more* of them than ever before go on to eventually ***require* dialysis**. As a result *— *virtually all health care providers will encounter patients with hyperkalemia at some frequency. \n+ **KEY *Clinical* Point:** With rare exceptions \\(ie, *hyperkalemic periodic paralysis*\\) *— *Hyperkalemia does *not* usually develop unless there are one or more ***predisposing* factors**. These should be inquired about in the history. Potential *predisposing* factors may include: **i\\)** Use of K\\+-retaining medications \\(*ACE-inhibitors; angiotensin-receptor blockers; K\\+-sparing diuretics*\\); **ii\\)** Potassium supplementation; **iii\\)** Renal failure/dialysis; **iv\\)** Acidosis; **v\\)** Dehydration; and **vi\\)** *Severe* trauma. \n\n \n\n**11.4 – Figure 11.4-1: *Ventricular Rhythm vs Hyperkalemia?***\n\nConsider the 2 rhythm strips shown below in **Figure 11.4-1**. Imagine each tracing was obtained from a hemodynamically stable older adult.\n\n+ Is the rhythm in **Panel A** *ventricular* escape? \n+ Is the rhythm in **Panel B** a *slow* form of VT? \n+ How would you proceed *clinically* in *each* case? \n+ What clinical information would you want to know about each patient? \\(**HINT:** *How might these 2 rhythms relate to the content of Section 11.3?*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.4-1:** *Ventricular* rhythms vs hyperkalemia? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 11.4-1:** Although our *initial* impression for *both* arrhythmias in this Figure is that a ***ventricular* rhythm** is present in *each* case — this is *not* necessarily the correct answer. For example — IF told that each patient was hemodynamically stable and on *longterm* dialysis \\(or* had a history of chronic kidney disease*\\) — then a ***stat* serum K\\+** value becomes *essential* for accurate diagnosis and *optimal* management.\n\n+ **Rhythm A** \\(*in* Figure 11.4-1\\) — shows QRS *widening* — a *slow* ventricular rate \\(~*45/minute*\\) — *lack* of P waves — and suggestion of T wave peaking. In a patient on longterm dialysis — one has to consider **hyperkalemia**\\! \n+ **Rhythm B** — closely resembles AIVR \\(*Accelerated IdioVentricular Rhythm*\\) — as was discussed in Section 02.38. But IF this patient had renal failure — ***Hyperkalemia*** would *again* become a key consideration. \n\n \n\n**BOTTOM Line:** IF it turned out that *marked* hyperkalemia was the reason for the *wide* rhythms in Panel A and Panel B — then *rather than* Pacing/Atropine — the treatment of choice *would be* Bicarb/Calcium.\n\n+ **History is *ever* important\\!** Sometimes a *stat* K\\+ level is needed for accurate diagnosis. Given the hemodynamically *stable* condition of each patient in Figure 11.4-1 — there *is* time for lab confirmation of the diagnosis. \n+ Knowing that a hemodynamically *stable* patient with a *wide-QRS* rhythm *without* sinus P waves has ***renal* failure** — goes a long way toward suggesting that what we are seeing in Figure 11.4-1 is a rhythm in a patient with **hyperkalemia** \\(*with changes in QRST morphology corresponding to that seen in* Panel D *or* Panel E *from* **Figure 11.3-1**\\). This is important since *optimal* treatment of this patient depends on *accurate* diagnosis of the reason for QRS widening. \n\n \n\n**11.5 – Figure 11.5-1: *Ischemia vs Hyperkalemia?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown in **Figure 11.5-1**. Clinically — What is *likely* to be going on? Is there ECG evidence of *ischemia*?\n\n\n\n**Figure 11.5-1:** *Ischemia* vs hyperkalemia? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 11.5-1:** Sinus rhythm at ~100/minute. The PR interval is normal; the QRS and QT are *borderline* prolonged. *Rightward* axis. *No* chamber enlargement.\n\n+ **QRST Changes** — There is a Q wave in lead I and there are QS complexes in leads aVL,V1,V2. Transition is slightly delayed \\(*occurs between V4-to-V5*\\). The most remarkable finding is the very **tall, *peaked* T waves** with *narrow *base \\(***“Eiffel Tower”*** *effect*\\) in at least *several* precordial leads. This strongly suggests ***hyperkalemia*** — perhaps with a ***serum* K\\+ ~6-7.5 mEq/L** \\(*See* Figure 11.3-1\\). In addition, T waves are *inverted* sharply in leads III and aVF and there is some ST *depression* in *infero-antero-lateral* leads. \n+ We would want to inquire from the history IF there were ***predisposing* factors** \\(*such as renal failure*\\) to the *severe* hyperkalemia that we suspect from this tracing. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* NOTES:** The ECG is the ***net* result** of the heart’s electrical activity. Therefore — ECG changes from *new* hyperkalemia will be *superimposed* on any *preexisting* ST-T wave abnormalities.\n\n+ We’ll have to *wait* until hyperkalemia is corrected *before* knowing IF *abnormal* findings \\(*right axis; QS complexes; T wave peaking; ST depression *and* T inversion*\\) are due to ischemia *as well as* hyperkalemia. \n+ In our experience — We have seen a great variety of *abnormal* ECG findings *disappear* once hyperkalemia is corrected. For unknown reasons — marked right axis \\(*as seen in* Figure 11.5-1\\) often resolves once serum K\\+ is again normal. \n+ Note in Figure 11.5-1 — that the *negative* peak of the *inverted* T waves in leads III,aVF is sharp \\(*pointed*\\). Although *positive* peaked and pointed T waves are much more commonly associated with hyperkalemia — T wave peaking may occasionally be *negative* with this electrolyte disorder. We’ll only know for sure after serum K\\+ is corrected and a *repeat* ECG is obtained. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** Be sure to ***repeat*** the **ECG** after hyperkalemia is *corrected* and *correlate* tracings to the *clinical* situation \\(ie, *chest pain with possible ischemia* vs *simple hyperkalemia?*\\). \n\n \n\n**11.6 – Figure 11.6-1: *Hyperkalemia vs Normal Variant?***\n\nFinally, consider the ECG in **Figure 11.6-1** — obtained from a *healthy* 30-year old man. How might your interpretation *change* — IF the patient was *older* on *longterm* dialysis?\n\n\n\n**Figure 11.6-1:** Hyperkalemia vs *Normal* Variant? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 11.6-1:** Sinus arrhythmia. *Normal* intervals and axis. *No* hypertrophy \\(*since the patient is only 30 years old*\\). T waves are peaked — and there is slight J-point ST elevation with an *upward* concavity \\(*“smiley” configuration*\\) in several precordial leads. **IMPRESSION:** Given that the patient is a young, otherwise healthy adult — this ECG almost certainly represents **ERP** \\(*Early Repolarization Pattern* — *Section 09.02*\\).\n\n+ But IF the patient was *older* with chronic kidney disease — then we would *definitely* **check** the ***serum* K\\+ value**. Even though T waves here do *not* manifest the typical *“Eiffel Tower”* effect in that they had a *broad* base with *asymmetric* ascent and descent of the T wave \\(**Figure 11.6-2**\\) — all bets would be off IF the patient had renal disease or other potential reason for hyperkalemia. ***BOTTOM* Line:** Clinical correlation is *key* to optimal interpretation. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.6-2:** Comparison of ECG characteristics for the T wave of hyperkalemia \\(**Panel C** — *reproduced from* Figure 11.3-1\\) — vs what is commonly seen as a ***normal* variant** in otherwise healthy adults. Note that the T wave of **Hyperkalemia** \\(*in* Panel C\\) generally manifests a more peaked \\(*pointed*\\) T wave with *narrow* base and *symmetric* ascent/descent of T wave. In contrast — the T wave in a **normal *repolarization* variant** tends to be *rounder* with *wider* base and *asymmetric* ascent/descent of T wave. Exceptions exist — so *clinical* correlation is essential \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**11.7 – HYPOKALEMIA: *ECG Manifestations/Clinical Features ***\n\nIn contrast to hyperkalemia — the ECG is *not* a reliable tool for assessing ***hypokalemia***. While true that it is *unlikely* for the ECG to be “normal” IF clinically *significant* hypokalemia is present — **ECG changes** are often ***nonspecific*** — they may be *difficult-to-interpret* — and in our experience, ECG changes are *suboptimal* in ability to correlate with degree of severity. We highlight the following ***Clinical* Caveats** regarding **ECG assessment** of **HypoKalemia**:\n\n+ Patients with hypokalemia do *not* always manifest ECG changes. In fact, the ECG of patients with even moderate hypokalemia may at times be *relatively* normal \\(*with little more than nonspecific abnormalities*\\). \n+ In contrast — Some patients who have *normal* serum K\\+ levels *do* manifest ECG changes that seem to suggest they have hypokalemia. \n+ ***BOTTOM* Line:** The ECG is simply *not* very accurate as a tool for assessing either the presence or severity of hypokalemia. This is *not* to say that the ECG should not be monitored in patients with hypokalemia. On the contrary — **ECG monitoring** may be ***helpful*** in a number of ways. These include: **i\\)** Detection of **arrhythmias** \\(*PVCs are common with hypokalemia; risk of VT is increased*\\); **ii\\)** The **QT** \\(*or QU*\\) **interval** may be significantly ***prolonged*** with hypokalemia — with associated *increased* risk of Torsades de Pointes \\(*Section 06.3*\\); and **iii\\)** *Serial* ECG changes that are followed as hypokalemia is treated and serum K\\+ returns to normal may provide insight to the likelihood of ***associated* ischemia** — vs ECG abnormalities being *primarily* a result of the electrolyte disorder. *Clinical correlation is KEY*. \n\n \n\n**FIGURE 11.7-1: *What are the ECG Changes?*** Having conveyed potential clinical caveats of depending on the ECG to assess hypokalemia — We review in *schematic* Figure 11.7-1 those **ECG Changes** that *have* been associated with low serum K\\+ values:\n\n+ **Panel A** — The ST-T wave is normal. This is the *baseline* tracing. \n+ **Panel B** — shows relative *flattening* of the T wave and ST segment. This is typically the *earliest* change. \n+ **Panel C** *and*** Panel D** — In association with ST-T wave flattening \\(*and often with some degree of ST depression*\\) — a **U wave** develops \\(*Section 11.9*\\). A* \"pseudo-P-pulmonale\"* pattern \\(*with P wave peaking in inferior leads*\\) may sometimes be seen. \n+ **Panel E** *and*** Panel F** — ST depression becomes more noticeable and the U wave increases in size \\(*red arrow in *Panel E\\) — until ultimately the U wave *overtakes* the T wave. At this point, distinguishing between the T wave and U wave may be almost impossible \\(ie, *there is really “****Q****-****U****\" rather than “****Q-T****”*** ***prolongation* — *as in ***Panel F**\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.7-1:** ECG Manifestations of ***Hypokalemia***. Starting from a normal ST-T wave \\(**Panel A**\\) *— *the *earliest* change is ST-T wave flattening \\(**Panel B**\\). This may be followed by some degree of ST depression and development of a **U wave** \\(*in* **Panel C** *and*** Panel D**\\). ST depression becomes more noticeable and the U wave increases in size \\(*red arrow in ***Panel E**\\) — until ultimately the U wave *overtakes* the T wave. At this point, distinguishing between the T wave and U wave may no longer be possible \\(**Panel F**\\). Despite this well described *sequential* evolution of ECG changes — many patients with hypokalemia “fail to read the textbook” \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**11.8 – HYPOMAGNESEMIA: *Clinical Features/ ECG Signs***\n\nIn our introduction to this segment on electrolyte abnormalities — We referred to **magnesium** as the ***“all-too-often forgotten cation”****. *Serum Mg\\+\\+ is still often *excluded* from routine chemistry profiles in many institutions. As a result — **Hypomagnesemia** often goes ***undetected*** unless the clinician is aware of the need to *specifically* assess for this cation.\n\n+ Hypomagnesemia is common in clinical practice. As is the case for potassium — the vast majority \\(\u003e*98%*\\) of body magnesium resides *within* the intracellular compartment. As a result — serum levels \\(*measuring a minority of body magnesium that resides within the extracellular compartment*\\) do *not* reliably reflect body \\(*and intracardiac*\\) magnesium stores. Thus, it is not uncommon for a patient to have a serum Mg\\+\\+ level that is still within the *low-normal* range \\(ie, *1.8 mg/dL*\\) — yet nevertheless having significant *body* depletion of this critical cation. **Therefore:** *Decidedly* low serum levels of Mg\\+\\+ *are* diagnostic for hypomagnesemia — but blood levels in the *low-normal* range still *could* reflect low *body* stores that may nevertheless be clinically important. \n+ ***Certain* conditions *predispose*** to **Hypomagnesemia**. These include: **i\\)** associated electrolyte deficiency \\(*hypokalemia; hyponatremia; hypocalcemia; hypophosphatemia*\\);** ii\\)** Use of certain medications \\(*diuretics, digitalis*\\); **iii\\)** *Overuse* of Alcohol; **iv\\)** Diabetes and other metabolic disorders; **v\\)** renal disease; and **vi\\)** Certain *cardiac* conditions \\(*low Mg\\+\\+ is common with acute MI; post-cardiac arrest; and in patients with various cardiac arrhythmias*\\). **KEY *Clinical* Point:** *Consider* hypomagnesemia \\(*even if the blood level is within the low normal range*\\) — in patients with any of the above potential *predisposing* conditions. \n+ **Hypomagnesemia** — may produce virtually ***identical* ECG changes** as may be seen with **hypokalemia** \\(Figure 11.7-1\\). That is — the ECG of a patient with low serum Mg\\+\\+ may *vary* from showing little more than minimal nonspecific changes — to showing *diffuse* ST-T flattening, ST depression, U waves, and *moderate-to-marked* QT \\(*or QU*\\) prolongation. \n+ Clinically — **Hypomagnesemia** often ***coexists*** with **hypokalemia**. The importance of *not* overlooking *coexistent* hypomagnesemia is that hypokalemia may prove *resistant* to K\\+ replacement until serum Mg\\+\\+ levels are restored to normal. \n\n \n\n**11.9 – U Waves: *Definition/Clinical Significance***\n\nThe most commonly cited ECG sign of hypokalemia is the presence of U waves. A** U wave** is recognized as the ECG deflection that occurs *after* the T wave — but *before* the next P wave \\(*red arrow in* **Panel B** *of schematic* **Figure 11.9-1**\\). Physiologically — U waves are thought to represent repolarization of Purkinje fibers. We highlight the following clinical points about ECG recognition and the ***clinical* significance** of **U waves**:\n\n+ U waves are *not* always present on an ECG tracing \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 11.9-1\\). When seen — they are often evident only in certain leads \\(*usually most easily recognized in leads II; V2,V3,V4*\\). \n+ U waves are *not* specific for **hypokalemia**. They may *also* be seen with ***hypomagnesemia*** — ***LVH*** — ***bradycardia*** — or simply on *normal* tracings *without* other abnormality. \n+ Like T waves — **U waves** may become ***inverted*** as a sign of ischemia \\(**Panel C**\\). This is usually quite subtle and *difficult* to see. To complicate recognition further — there may be ST depression with a *biphasic* terminal T wave \\(**Panel D**\\). As a result — ***We Suggest*** the following: IF not obvious on the patient’s ECG — *Do not worry about U waves\\!* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.9-1:** *Recognition* of **U Waves** on ECG. **Panel A** — A U wave will not always be seen on ECG. When present, a **U wave** is recognized as the ECG deflection that occurs *after* the T wave — but *before* the next P wave \\(*red arrow in* **Panel B**\\). U waves are usually best seen in leads II; V2,V3,V4 — but they may be seen in any lead. They are *not* specific for hypokalemia \\(*U waves may also be seen with hypomagnesemia, LVH, bradycardia — and sometimes as a normal variant in healthy subjects*\\). **Panel C** — U waves may be subtle in appearance and they may be inverted \\(*sometimes as a sign of ischemia*\\). **Panel D** — It is *not* always easy to know if late baseline deflections reflect U waves or not \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**11.10 – Figure 11.10-1: *Electrolyte Disturbance or Ischemia?***\n\nWe conclude this segment on hypokalemia with the ECG shown below in **Figure 11.10-1**. This tracing was obtained from a patient with a history of alcohol abuse and *atypical* chest pain. *Obvious* ST-T wave abnormalities are present.\n\n+ Given this clinical scenario — Are the ECG abnormalities seen likely to reflect *ischemia *or *electrolyte* disturbance? *How can you tell?* \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 11.10-1:** ECG obtained from a patient with a history of alcohol abuse and *atypical* chest pain. Are the ECG abnormalities seen likely to reflect *ischemia* or *electrolyte* disturbance? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 11.10-1:** There is sinus arrhythmia. PR and QRS intervals are normal — but the **QT** is ***prolonged*** \\(*clearly more than half the R-R interval in lead II, as well as in other leads*\\). The axis is normal. No chamber enlargement.\n\n+ The most remarkable finding is diffuse **ST-T wave flattening/depression** with ***symmetric *T inversion** in leads V4,V5,V6. In addition — **U waves** are seen in multiple leads \\(*most obvious in leads V2,V3 = blue arrows*\\). The U wave in lead II \\(*large red arrow*\\) seems to *blend* with the T wave in this lead \\(*similar to* **Panel F** *in *Figure 11.7-1\\). \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Impression****:** There are 2 principle abnormalities in Figure 11.10-1: **i\\)** A *long* QT interval; and **ii\\)** *Diffuse* ST-T wave flattening, some ST depression, and *symmetric* T wave inversion. ***Clinical* correlation** is needed for optimal determination of *likely* etiologies. Comparison with a ***prior* ECG** \\(*if available*\\) — would be extremely helpful in knowing whether the changes seen are likely to be new or old.\n\n+ The ***long* QT interval** should prompt consideration of our **LIST \\#3** \\(*Section 06.2*\\). In brief — Consider: **i\\)** Drugs; **ii\\)** “Lytes” \\(*especially low K\\+ and/or low Mg\\+\\+ given this patient’s history of alcohol abuse*\\); and **iii\\)** CNS disturbance. \n+ ***Diffuse* ST-T wave abnormalities** including ST flattening, ST depression and T wave inversion — should prompt consideration of our **LIST \\#4** \\(*Section 09.26*\\). Among potentially relevant entities to consider on this list in view of this patient’s history of alcohol abuse and chest pain are: **i\\)** drug effect \\(*if this patient was on digitalis or a diuretic*\\); **ii\\)** electrolyte disturbance \\(*especially low K\\+ and/or low Mg\\+\\+*\\); and **iii\\)** ischemia. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line****:** There is *no way* to be certain from this *single* ECG whether the abnormalities seen in Figure 11.10-1 represent ischemia — electrolyte disturbance — or some combination of these, perhaps in association with other factors.\n\n+ ***Clinical* correlation** including lab values, serial tracings and close follow-up of this patient’s clinical course — will be needed in order to know for certain. Even IF serum electrolyte values initially come back low — this would *not *exclude the possibility of *ischemic* T wave inversion *superimposed* on *electrolyte-induced* ST-T wave abnormalities. \n+ That said — We **strongly *suspect* hypokalemia** \\(*and probably also hypomagnesemia*\\) are at least *in part* responsible for the ECG abnormalities seen in Figure 11.10-1 because: **i\\)** the history of alcohol abuse predisposes the patient to low K\\+/low Mg\\+\\+ levels; and **ii\\)** the presence of very ***prominent* U waves** in several leads plus ***marked* QT prolongation** are both highly characteristic of these electrolyte disorders. Resolution of ECG abnormalities on serial tracings as electrolyte disturbance is corrected would confirm a *cause-and-effect* relationship. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**12.0 – *Acute* Pericarditis**\n\n\n\nPericarditis is an inflammation of the fibrous lining of the heart. The **pericardium** itself is a *double-layered* membrane which covers the heart, as well as containing the roots of the great vessels. There are ***2 layers*** to the ***pericardial* lining**. These are:** i\\)** the inner ***visceral* pericardium** \\(*which is attached to the epicardium, or outer layer of the heart*\\); and **ii**\\) the ***parietal* pericardium** \\(*which is the outer layer of the pericardial sac*\\).\n\n+ Normally there is a potential *space* between the visceral and parietal pericardial layers = the pericardial “cavity”. Lubrication by a *small* amount of pericardial fluid allows *normal* free movement of the heart within the pericardial sac. \n+ Problems arise when because of inflammation \\(*or other insult to the pericardial lining*\\) — the amount of pericardial fluid increases. This results in pericardial “effusion. In its extreme — there may be pericardial *tamponade*, with inability of the heart to contract within the pericardial sac due to massive effusion *and/or* rigidity of the sac itself. \n\n \n\n***Clinical* Points:** The finding on **Echo** of a *small* “pericardial effusion” — is usually a normal phenomenon. Some fluid is needed for normal lubrication between visceral and parietal layers.\n\n+ **Echo** is an ***excellent* modality** for detecting pericardial fluid and estimating the amount of fluid. Anything more than a “small effusion” is *not* normal. \n+ Echo is invaluable as a bedside diagnostic aid for detecting larger effusions and determining IF pericardial tamponade is present. \n+ Simple viral pericarditis \\(*the most common kind of acute pericarditis*\\) — often does *not* produce any abnormality on Echo because: **i\\)** The pericardium is a thin layer. Inflammation generally produces *no* abnormality detectable on echo; and **ii\\)** Uncomplicated viral pericarditis usually does *not* produce significant pericardial effusion. **Therefore** — A *normal* Echo does *not* rule out *acute* pericarditis. On the contrary — a “normal” Echo is the most common finding you will see. \n\n \n\n**12.1 – *Acute* Pericarditis: *How to Make the Diagnosis?***\n\nPericarditis can be a *challenging* diagnosis to make. Recognition of ***acute* pericarditis** may be facilitated by thinking of the diagnosis as a 3-part process. These **3 components** consist of: **i\\)** History; **ii\\)** Physical examination; and **iii\\)** ECG findings.\n\n**History:** The 1st step in making the diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis rests with obtaining the history. Information regarding the patient’s *prior* medical history — *recent* health issues — and the presence and nature of ***symptoms*** are all relevant.\n\n+ ***Potential* Etiologies** of ***acute* pericarditis** are *many* and extend *beyond* the scope of this ECG-2014-ePub. The most common scenario is acute or recent ***viral* illness** occurring in a relatively *young* adult. Almost any viral agent may be responsible. That said — identification of the specific causative agent \\(ie, *by obtaining acute viral studies*\\) is often *not* undertaken because most cases of **acute *viral* pericarditis** \\(*also known as ****“idiopathic”**** pericarditis*\\) — are relatively benign, *spontaneously* resolve and do *not* recur. Knowing which virus is the “culprit” agent does *not* alter treatment, is expensive, and does *not* affect the ultimate course in most patients. ***Clinical* NOTE:** Given that ***up to* 90%** of all cases of acute pericarditis occurring in out-patients are viral \\(*idiopathic*\\) and usually occurring in *otherwise* healthy adults — ***KEY* Questions** to ask relate to: **i\\)** Whether there is a history of *preceding* viral illness; **ii\\)** *Prior* health status; and **iii\\)** *Previous* episodes \\(*viral pericarditis may recur, though this is not common*\\). \n+ *KEY* Point A ***different*** set of ***diagnostic* considerations** should be contemplated when considering acute pericarditis in an ***older* patient** with ***underlying* medical disorders**. Among the many possible *other* etiologies for pericarditis include: **i\\)** *Non-viral* infections \\(*tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal septicemia; immunocompromise*\\); **ii\\)** Uremia \\(*pericarditis is a common complication of end-stage renal disease*\\); **iii\\)** Malignancy \\(*metastasis to the pericardium*\\); **iv\\)** Collagen vascular disease \\(*rheumatoid arthritis; lupus; scleroderma*\\); **v\\)** *Post-radiation* pericarditis; **vi\\)** Chest trauma; **vii\\)** Post-myocardial infarction pericarditis \\(*Dressler syndrome*\\); **viii\\)** *Post-pericardiotomy* syndrome; and **ix\\)** Still *other* causes. ***Clinical* NOTE:** Pericarditis caused by *any* of the above entities is usually a ***different* disease** than uncomplicated *viral* pericarditis that occurs in a previously healthy young adult. The course is often far more severe, longer lasting, and much more likely to be associated with pericardial effusion *and/or* tamponade. Awareness of the patient’s **past *medical* history** may be *KEY* to suspecting the diagnosis for these other forms of *non-viral* pericarditis. \n\n \n\n**Symptoms:** We *limit* discussion of symptoms to*** Chest* Discomfort**. Fever and dyspnea may also be seen with *acute* pericarditis *— *but these symptoms are nonspecific. The ***chest* pain** associated with ***acute* pericarditis** may be moderate or severe. It is characterized by being: **i\\)** *Pleuritic*; and **ii\\)** *Positional* in nature.\n\n+ ***Pleuritic* chest pain** — is often sharp in nature and increases with inspiration \\(*a result of associated pleural inflammation*\\). \n+ ***Positional* chest pain** — is typically relieved by sitting up and exacerbated by lying supine \\(*lying supine stretches the inflamed pericardium — whereas sitting up takes tension off the inflamed pericardium*\\). \n+ ***Clinical* NOTE \\#1:** Although the nature and severity of chest pain associated with *acute* pericarditis is highly variable — eliciting a ***pleuritic*** and/or ***positional* component** can be very helpful in suspecting the diagnosis, especially when the patient is a previously healthy young adult. \n+ ***Clinical *NOTE \\#2:** Given the common diagnostic dilemma of distinguishing between **ERP** \\(*Early Repolarization Pattern*\\) vs Pericarditis \\(*Section 12.9*\\) — it is helpful to remember that **acute *viral* pericarditis** is *very ****unlikely*** in the ***absence*** of **symptoms**. In contrast — chest pain is *less* uniformly present in some of the other *non-viral* etiologies of *acute* pericarditis. \n\n \n\n***Physical* Examination:** There are **2 Goals** of physical exam: **i\\)** To try to make a *definitive* diagnosis by hearing a **pericardial *friction* rub**; and ii\\) to ***rule *out* other *causes** of chest discomfort \\(*pulmonary problems; musculoskeletal pain; herpes zoster; etc.*\\).\n\n+ Characteristics of a pericardial *friction* rub are that it is a **scratchy, *superficial* sound** \\(*like walking on snow*\\). There may be only one or several components to the rub. It may wax and wane in loudness — often becoming louder during inspiration. The rub is often transient, and may be intermittent — so it is worthwhile auscultating the patient on *at least* several occasions. ***BOTTOM* Line:** IF a pericardial friction rub is heard — then the diagnosis of acute pericarditis is made\\! However — *not* hearing a rub does *not* rule out pericarditis. ***Clinical* Reality:** Despite a cited incidence in the literature of well *over* 50% of patients with *acute* pericarditis having a rub at some point during their course — the diagnosis of many \\(*if not most*\\) cases of *acute* pericarditis is made in the *absence* of hearing a rub. \n+ As noted above — the history for *acute* pericarditis is often nonspecific \\(ie, *recent nonspecific viral infection*\\) — and the nature of chest pain may be variable. As a result — *other* causes of chest pain may be confused with the diagnosis. The other major ***purpose*** of ***physical* examination** is therefore to ***rule out*** some of these ***other*** pulmonary or musculoskeletal **causes** of chest pain. \n\n \n\n**12.2 – ECG FINDINGS of *Acute* Pericarditis**\n\nIn clinical practice — the diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis is most often made on the basis of ECG findings. **ECG Changes** are divided into **4 stages**. The easiest way to remember these *sequential* ECG findings is to conceptualize the 4 stages as follows \\(**Figure 12.2-1**\\):\n\n+ **Stage I** — *Everything is UP*. That is — there is ST elevation in *almost* all leads \\(*except perhaps in the right-sided leads = leads III,aVR,V1*\\)*.* \n+ **Stage II** — *Transition*. There may be *“pseudonormalization”* in this stage that temporally occurs *between* the diffuse ST elevation of Stage I and the diffuse T wave inversion to follow. \n+ **Stage III** — *Everything is DOWN. *That is — there is *diffuse* T wave inversion in virtually all leads. \n+ **Stage IV** — Normalization \\(*as the ECG changes of acute pericarditis eventually resolve*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.2-1:** The **4 *Sequential* Stages** of Pericarditis. **Stage I** \\(*diffuse ST elevation*\\) — is the *only* one of the 4 stages that is ***diagnostic*** of ***acute* pericarditis**. The amount of time spent in each stage is variable. “Pseudonormalization” in **Stage II** — explains why even *relatively* new-onset pericarditis may sometimes manifest minimal ECG changes \\(*or no ECG changes at all*\\). The **Stage III** phase \\(*diffuse T wave inversion*\\) — is *nonspecific* and may be impossible to distinguish from ischemia. Ultimately, ECG changes resolve \\(**Stage IV**\\) — though this may take weeks or months. **PEARL:** To remember the 4 stages — Think *everything* UP \\(*1st Stage*\\) — transition \\(*2nd Stage*\\) — *everything* DOWN \\(*3rd Stage*\\) — Resolution \\(*4th Stage*\\).\n\n***KEY* Points *regarding* Figure 12.2-1:** The *amount* of **time** for ***evolution*** through the **4 ECG stages** of acute pericarditis is ***highly *variable** \\(*it may take hours *—* to days *—* to weeks or more*\\).\n\n+ *Practically* speaking — the *only* ECG stage that is *diagnostic* is **Stage I**. This means that IF Stage I has *already* passed — it will *no longer be possible *to diagnose pericarditis by ECG \\(*because the ECG may almost look “normal” in Stage II *— and* in Stage III it shows diffuse T wave inversion that may be indistinguishable from ischemia*\\). \n+ *Awareness* of the above *expected* sequence of changes explains why the ECG may look relatively “normal” at an *early* stage in the process \\(ie, *during transitional Stage II in which ST segments return to baseline before going on to evolve into diffuse T wave inversion*\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n***Clinical* Notes:** *Additional* lab tests \\(*including Echo*\\) will often be ordered on patients with *suspected* pericarditis. That said — it is *rare* that these other tests will be “the test” that makes the diagnosis.\n\n+ **Echo** is ***usually* normal** — because the inflamed but nevertheless *thin* pericardial lining is *not* picked up by simple Echo *unless* an associated *significant* pericardial effusion is present \\(*Section 12.0*\\). Pericardial effusion is *absent* in many \\(*if not most*\\) cases of acute *viral* pericarditis that occurs in otherwise healthy subjects *without* other underlying systemic disease. \n+ The diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis can be *easy *IF — a ***pericardial* friction rub** is heard. But IF no rub is heard \\(*as is often the case*\\) — then **diagnosis** must be ***presumptive ***\\(*based on history and ECG findings*\\). Fortunately — a *presumptive* approach is reasonable given the generally *benign *and* self-limiting *course of most cases of *acute* viral \\(*idiopathic*\\) pericarditis that occur in otherwise healthy individuals. \n\n \n\n**12.3 – Stage I of *Acute* Pericarditis**\n\nGiven that **ECG diagnosis** of ***acute* pericarditis** can really *only* be ***made*** in **Stage I** — We focus on recognizing ECG findings in this stage \\(**Figure 12.3-1**\\):\n\n+ There will *often* be ***sinus* tachycardia**. While sinus tachycardia is a *nonspecific* finding that is *not* essential for diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis — the *absence* of at least a *relatively* rapid heart rate is a factor *against* the diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis. \n+ There is ***diffuse* ST segment elevation** \\(*Stage I is the “everything UP” stage*\\). This generalized ST elevation is thought to reflect a diffuse *subepicardial* injury current. The only leads that do *not* consistently show ST elevation are one or more of the *right-sided* leads \\(*III, aVR and V1*\\) that view the heart from a more distant perspective \\(*leads shaded in blue in* Figure 12.3-1\\). \n+ The ***shape*** of **ST elevation** with acute pericarditis is often quite *similar* to that seen with early repolarization \\(***concave up**** = “smiley” configuration, sometimes with J-point notching*\\). It is almost as if the ST segment itself is normal and has been “lifted” above the baseline. \n+ With *acute* pericarditis — the appearance of **ST segments** in **leads I** and **II** tends to look ***similar***. This differs from the usual situation with acute *inferior* MI — in which lead III is much more likely to resemble lead II. \n+ There is **no *reciprocal* ST depression**\\! This is a key distinguishing feature of acute pericarditis from *acute* MI. \n+ *Infarction* Q waves are absent \\(*No more than small q waves are seen*\\). \n+ **PR segment *depression ***is often noted in ***several* leads** \\(*seen in *Figure 12.3-1* in leads I,II and V2,V3 *— *but not in leads aVL,aVF; V4,V5,V6*\\). PR depression is thought to reflect an atrial injury current. As was the case with atrial infarction \\(*Section 09.35*\\) — look to **lead aVR** for ***reciprocal* PR elevation** \\(*which is present in* Figure 12.3-1\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.3-1:** ECG Findings in **Stage I *Acute* Pericarditis**. The most characteristic finding is ***diffuse* ST elevation** in all but one or more of the *“right-sided”* leads \\(*leads III,aVR,V1*\\). ST elevation is generally concave up \\(*“smiley”-shape*\\) — although *coved* ST elevation is seen here in leads V2,V3. As commonly occurs with early repolarization — there may be J-point notching in one or more leads \\(*seen here in leads I,V6*\\). Lead I often resembles lead II \\(*rather than lead III, as would occur with acute inferior MI*\\). There is *no* reciprocal ST depression. Finally, **PR depression** is often seen in at least several leads \\(*here in leads I,II and V2,V3*\\) — with PR elevation in lead aVR.\n\n**12.4 – PR Depression: *How Helpful a Sign is this?***\n\nNormally — the **PR segment** is *isoelectric* with respect to the ST segment baseline \\(**Panel A** *in* Figure 12.4-1\\). It is from this PR segment baseline that we generally judge ST segment deviations \\(*elevation* or *depression*\\) — assuming baseline wander is minimal and that the heart rate is not so fast as to preclude identification of the PR segment \\(*Section 09.15*\\).\n\n+ With generalized inflammation of the pericardial lining — ***depression*** of the **PR segment** *below* the ST baseline will often be seen in *at least* several leads. Recognition of **PR depression** should be evident in **Figure 12.4-1** by comparing the PR segment in **Panel B** \\(*relative to its dotted ST segment baseline*\\) — with the normal \\(*isoelectric*\\) PR segment seen in Panel A. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.4-1:** Comparison of a *normal* PR segment \\(**Panel A**\\) — with PR depression seen in **Panel B**, in which the PR segment descends *below* the ST baseline \\(*See text*\\).\n\n***Clinical* CAVEATS:** PR depression is often subtle. As a result — this finding is subject to *inter- *and* intra-observer* variability.\n\n+ PR depression is *not* always seen with *acute* pericarditis. \n+ PR depression may occasionally be seen in *other* conditions. These include:** i\\)** normal repolarization variants; **ii\\)** patients with acute MI \\(*and/or with atrial infarction*\\); and **iii\\)** with tachycardia \\(*the PR shortens with tachycardia, which makes PR assessment more challenging at faster heart rates*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** *Be aware* of the term **PR depression** — as this will often come up in *diagnostic* discussion about possible *acute* pericarditis. Definite identification of PR depression in *several* leads is possible — and is diagnostically useful \\(**Figure 12.4-2**\\). Support that the finding of PR depression is *real* and meaningful may be derived by the finding of **PR *elevation*** in **lead aVR**. That said — Be aware that *both* false *positive* and false *negative* diagnosis of acute pericarditis is frequently associated with the phenomenon of seeing PR depression.\n\n+ **Therefore** — It is probably best *not* to base your diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis on whether or not you see PR depression. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.4-2:** *Schematic* tracing illustrating ECG findings of *acute* pericarditis \\(*reproduced from* Figure 12.3-1\\). In addition to seeing *diffuse* ST elevation in the *absence* of reciprocal ST depression — **PR *depression*** is seen in several leads \\(*red arrows*\\). Support that this finding of PR depression is real — is forthcoming from the finding of **PR *elevation*** in **lead aVR** \\(*blue arrow*\\). While not enough by itself to make the diagnosis of acute pericarditis — PR depression \\(*in association with PR elevation in lead aVR*\\) is clearly supportive of the diagnosis \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**12.5 – What is *Spodick’s* Sign?**\n\nAn additional ECG diagnostic sign that is often mentioned with discussion of *acute* pericarditis — is ***Spodick’s* sign** \\(*named after Dr. David Spodick who is internationally known for his work on pericarditis*\\).\n\n+ ***Spodick’s* Sign** — is a ***downsloping*** of the **TP** \\(*or entire QRS-TP*\\) **segment** that may be present in a number of leads with *acute* pericarditis \\(*downward slanting red dotted line in ***Figure 12.5-1**\\). When seen in at least a few leads in association with a *suggestive* clinical history and *other* typical ECG findings — this sign further supports the diagnosis of *acute* pericarditis. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.5-1:** Spodick’s sign — defined as a *downsloping* of the TP \\(*or entire QRS-TP*\\) segment \\(*red dotted line*\\). ***Clinical* Caveat** — In our experience, determination of whether or not ***Spodick’s* sign** is present is often *subjective* and *suboptimally* reproducible. While we regularly look for this sign when contemplating the diagnosis of acute pericarditis — We caution *against* depending on presence or absence of Spodick’s sign as your sole criterion for diagnosing acute pericarditis \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**12.6 –* Differential* Diagnosis: *Acute* MI vs *Early* Repolarization?**\n\n*Distinction* between Stage 1 pericarditis and early repolarization or acute MI can *usually* be made because:\n\n+ ***Early* Repolarization** — is most often seen in otherwise *healthy* young adults. ST elevation is usually ***localized*** to one \\(*at most two*\\) areas of the heart — vs **more *diffuse* ST elevation** with ***pericarditis***. Be aware that the *shape* of ST segment elevation may be similar with both conditions \\(*“smiley” configuration*\\) — and J-point notching may be seen in both conditions. \n+ ***Acute* MI** — is usually suggested by the history \\(*older patient with risk factors; chest pain is more constant and severe *— and* chest pain is less likely to be pleuritic or positional*\\). The ECG may show **Q waves** — and Q waves may *increase* in size as the infarct evolves. There will usually be at least some ***reciprocal* ST depression** during the course of *acute* MI — whereas *neither* pericarditis *nor* early repolarization manifest *reciprocal* changes. \n\n \n\n**PEARL:** A distinguishing feature between acute MI and pericarditis — is that with *acute* MI, T wave inversion will often be seen *while* the ST segment is *still* elevated \\(**Figure 12.6-1**\\). In contrast, with *acute* pericarditis — ST segments are first diffusely elevated \\(*1st Stage*\\) — then ST segments return to baseline \\(*2nd Stage*\\) — and *only then* is there T wave inversion \\(*3rd Stage*\\). Thus, the picture in *schematic* Figure 12.6-1 is strongly suggestive of ***acute* MI** rather than pericarditis because the T wave is inverted *while* the ST segment is still elevated.\n\n+ ***Final* Point:** As previously noted \\(*in Section 12.3*\\) — ST segments in leads I and II tend to look similar with *acute* pericarditis. This is in contrast to what is usually seen with acute *inferior* MI — in which case lead III is much more likely to resemble lead II in appearance. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.6-1:** With ***acute *Pericarditis** — the T wave typically does *not* invert until *after* the ST segment has returned to baseline \\(*Section 12.2*\\). In contrast, with ***acute* MI** \\(*as seen here*\\) — the T wave may invert *while* the ST segment is *still* elevated.\n\n**12.7 –* Acute* Myocarditis/Endocarditis: *ECG Changes?***\n\nThe causes and symptoms of ***acute* Myocarditis** and **Endocarditis** are *many* and extend *beyond* the scope of this ECG PB book. Our purpose in this brief subsection is merely to increase awareness of the ECG abnormalities that *may* be seen. The **ECG picture** is ***not* predictable** with either ***myocarditis*** or ***endocarditis***. It may include:\n\n+ *Various* forms of SA and AV nodal block \\(*from 1st degree — up to 3rd degree AV block with long pauses*\\). \n+ *Conduction* system defects \\(*BBB, hemiblocks, IVCD*\\). \n+ Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias \\(*including VT/VFib*\\). \n+ The *gamut* of ST-T wave abnormalities \\(*ST elevation/depression; T wave inversion; nonspecific ST changes*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** ECG findings with myocarditis and endocarditis are highly variable and nonspecific. Abnormalities may be minimal or marked. Awareness of this variability may help to explain *extreme* abnormalities that may be seen when *either* myocarditis or endocarditis are suspected.\n\n**12.8 – FIGURE 12.8-1: *Acute MI or Pericarditis?***\n\nConsider the ECG shown in Figure 12.8-1 *— *obtained from a 35-year old man with *atypical* chest pain.\n\n+ Are the findings suggestive of *acute* MI or *acute* pericarditis? \n+ *How certain* are you of your diagnosis? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.8-1:** *Acute* MI vs ***Acute* Pericarditis**.\n\n**Answer to Figure 12.8-1:** The rhythm is sinus. All intervals and the axis are normal. No chamber enlargement. Early transition \\(*the R wave becomes taller than the S wave is deep by lead V2*\\). Otherwise *— *the principal finding is ***diffuse* ST elevation** that is present in virtually all leads *except* for leads I,aVR and aVL.\n\n+ The amount and extent of ST elevation in Figure 12.8-1 is *more* than is usually expected with early repolarization. ST elevation is concave up. There is J-point notching or slurring in a number of leads. \n+ **PR *depression*** is seen \\(*red arrows*\\). In addition *— *there is **PR *elevation*** in lead aVR \\(*blue arrow*\\). Together with the presence of *diffuse* ST elevation *— *this all favors ***acute* pericarditis** as the diagnosis. \n+ **P.S.:** We find it *difficult* to tell if ***Spodick’s* sign** \\(*Section 12.5*\\) is present or not in leads II and III of Figure 12.8-1. As previously noted *— *We caution *against* dependence on this sign when its presence is questionable because of subjectivity in its interpretation. \n+ **Finally** *— *The likelihood of *acute* MI is low. This is because: **i\\)** ST elevation is diffuse and manifests an upward concavity with J-Point notching; and **ii\\)** There is *no* reciprocal ST depression. In contrast *— *the ST elevation of *acute* MI is typically coved; localized to one \\(*or at most 2*\\) lead areas; not notched; and associated with *reciprocal* ST depression. The patient’s relatively *younger* age and *atypical* symptoms in this case are also *against* acute MI. This patient *did* have ***acute* pericarditis**. \n\n \n\n**12.9 – FIGURE 12.9-1: *Pericarditis or Early Repolarization?***\n\nWe conclude this segment on *acute* pericarditis by revisiting the ECG shown in Figure 12.9-1 — which we *initially* encountered in Section 09.19 when discussing early repolarization.\n\n+ How would you interpret this tracing IF told that it was obtained from an otherwise *healthy* young adult? \n+ Would your interpretation *change* — IF told that this young adult had a *recent* upper respiratory infection and was complaining of *pleuritic-type* chest pain? \n+ *Despite* ST elevation in *several* leads — Why is the ECG shown in Figure 12.9-1 *not* suggestive of an *acute* MI? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 12.9-1:** ECG obtained from a young adult \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.19-1\\). Would your interpretation of this tracing *change* IF the clinical scenario was *recent* URI with *pleuritic* chest pain? — vs *sudden-onset* of *crushing* chest pain in an *older* patient? — vs a young adult who was *not* having symptoms? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 12.9-1:** As emphasized in Section 09.19 — our *descriptive* analysis for ECG findings on this 12-lead tracing does *not* change regardless of the history. Only the *relative* probabilities for our clinical impression will change depending on the clinical scenario.\n\n+ ***Descriptive* Analysis:** There is sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis. Voltage for LVH would *not* be present if the patient was younger \\(*less than 35 years of age*\\). Transition is normal \\(*occurs between lead V3-to-V4*\\). \n+ A Q wave with T wave inversion is seen in lead III. Small, narrow q waves are seen in V5,V6. Taken in isolation — *none* of these findings are necessarily abnormal. \n+ Instead — the most remarkable finding on this ECG is **ST elevation** in ***multiple* leads**. This ST elevation manifests an *upward* concavity \\(*“smiley”-configuration*\\) in most leads in which it is seen — although the ST segment is *coved* in lead V2, and the ST segment takeoff is *straightened* in lead V3. \n+ **J-point *notching*** is seen in *several* leads. This is most notable in leads V5,V6 — but *also* present in leads I,II,aVF and V4. The *shape* of this J-point notching is characteristic of early repolarization. \n+ *Infarction* Q waves are absent. That is — the q waves in leads V5,V6 are small and narrow, with the appearance of being normal *septal* q waves. The Q wave in lead III is deeper — but as an *isolated* finding, this is *not* necessarily abnormal \\(*Section 09.12*\\). \n+ There is *no* reciprocal ST depression \\(*isolated T wave inversion in lead III does not qualify in this case as “reciprocal” ST depression*\\). \n+ We do *not* appreciate PR depression. \n+ Lead II seems to resemble lead I more than lead III. \n+ We can easily *“talk ourself into”* a positive Spodick sign for the sloping TP segment in leads V4,V5,V6. \n\n \n\n**Putting *Together* ECG Findings in Figure 12.9-1:** Our reason for presenting this ECG again \\(*reproduced from* Figure 09.19-1\\) — is to emphasize: **i\\)** How *challenging* it may sometimes be to assess the ECG of a patient with chest pain and ST elevation; and **ii\\)** How important the clinical scenario is in our interpretation.\n\n+ IF this patient was an ***asymptomatic*** otherwise healthy** young adult** — We would *not* hesitate calling this ***Early* Repolarization** \\(*concave up ST elevation in multiple leads; J-point notching; no infarction q waves and no reciprocal ST depression*\\). \n+ On the other hand — IF this young adult had ***pleuritic* chest pain** with a ***recent* URI** — We would have to be concerned about the *possibility* of ***acute* pericarditis** \\(*diffuse ST elevation and lack of reciprocal ST depression in the setting of a history consistent with acute pericarditis*\\). Although the *slow* heart rate and highly characteristic J-point notching seen here might lead us to question this diagnosis — in the absence of a prior tracing to document longstanding early repolarization, it would be difficult to exclude acute pericarditis. \n+ Finally — IF this patient was ***older*** with ***new-onset* chest discomfort** — All bets would be off \\(*especially in the absence of a prior ECG for comparison*\\)\\! Although the ECG in Figure 12.9-1 does *not* show infarction Q waves, *reciprocal* ST depression, or ST coving more suggestive of acute injury — the onus of proof when the history is concerning falls on us to *rule out* the possibility of early acute MI \\(*rather than having to rule it in*\\). At the least, we would start by *repeating* the ECG in short order to see if any evolution occurs. Whether or not to admit this patient \\(*and/or to consider acute investigation*\\) — would depend on a series of factors as discussed in detail in Section 10. \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** An ECG such as that seen in Figure 12.9-1 — could be *consistent* with *acute* pericarditis or even early *acute* injury — IF clinical features suggesting either diagnosis were present. As relevant to Section 12 — Assessing the patient with chest pain for the possibility of *acute* pericarditis is often a *challenging* task that entails far *more* than simply looking at the patient’s ECG.\n\n+ **P.S.** — It turned out in this case that the ST segment elevation seen in *multiple* leads in Figure 12.9-1 was a **normal *repolarization* variant** \\(*and not due to acute coronary syndrome or pericarditis*\\). \n+ **PEARL:** Making this patient a ***miniaturized* copy** of his **ECG** that he can carry in his wallet may be a prudent way to *avoid* unnecessary hospital admission in the event chest discomfort is experienced in the future. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n**13.0 – *Computerized* ECG Interpretations**\n\n\n\nA frequent question that arises is, “How best to use \\(*or not use*\\) the ***computerized* ECG interpretation**?” *Opinions vary*. We feel the answer depends on the goals and *experience* level of the interpreter.\n\n+ *Computerized* ECG analysis systems are ***not* infallible**. Although they clearly have merit in certain regards — they are far from perfect at ECG interpretation. Our task is to *appreciate the positives* of computer systems *while* being aware of their drawbacks. \n\n \n\n**13.1 – *Computerized* Systems: *Pros \u0026 Cons***\n\nAt the current time — virtually *all* modern ECG machines *automatically* provide a ***computerized* interpretation.** This has *benefits* and *drawbacks*. Consider the following:\n\n+ *Computerized* systems ***excel*** at computing **values**. This is because *that’s what computers do*. As a result — *computerized* systems are ***extremely* accurate** in calculating: **i\\)** Rate; **ii\\)** Intervals \\(*PR/QRS/QT intervals*\\); and **iii\\)** Axis. \n+ *Computerized* systems are *usually* reliable in recognizing ***sinus* rhythm** mechanisms and ***normal* tracings**. \n+ For the ***Expert* Interpreter** — the *best* feature of *computerized* systems is that they ***save* time**\\! There is *no longer need* to calculate rate, intervals or axis — since the computer *instantly* provides legible and *accurate* print-out of these values. IF the computer says, *“Normal ECG”* — it may literally take *no more* than 2-3 seconds for an *experienced* interpreter to peruse the tracing and *sign* the report \\(*provided there is agreement with the computer interpretation*\\). \n+ For the ***Non-Expert *Interpreter** — the major benefit of *computerized* systems is the ***backup* opinion** the system provides. The computer may suggest findings *not* initially thought of by a *less* experienced interpreter. This encourages more careful, targeted review of the tracing. It may also be *educational* by the suggestions it makes. Finally — confidence is boosted when computer analysis agrees with the clinician’s interpretation. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** The computer backup opinion **may *also* help** the ***expert-in-a-hurry*** by *reducing* the chance that any ECG findings will be overlooked.\n\n+ Interpretation of any *one* ECG by an expert provided with: **i\\)** a moment of time; and **ii\\)** the clinical history — will *always* be superior to interpretation by a machine. That said — this is *not* reality. \n+ Reality in the “real world” — is that the clinician assigned to interpret *all* tracings on a given hospital or ambulatory service usually has *limited* time to interpret a *large* number of ECGs and is often asked to do so *without* the benefit of clinical history. As a result — it becomes *easy* for even an expert interpreter to *overlook* certain findings on occasional tracings. **Knowing *how* to use** the *computerized* interpretation as a ***“backup opinion”*** can be invaluable even for the most experienced of interpreters\\! \\(*Grauer, Nelson, Marriott et al: J Am Bd Fam Prac 1:17-24, 1989*\\). \n\n \n\n**CAVEATS \\(*What the Computer May Miss*\\):** *Computerized* systems do *not* do nearly as well in evaluation of abnormal tracings as they do in assessing ECGs with minimal abnormalities. The more complex the abnormal ECG is — the more difficult it becomes for a *computerized* system to render an entirely accurate interpretation.\n\n+ *Computerized* systems are far less accurate interpreting rhythms that do *not* have a sinus mechanism. \n+ They may miss *subtle* infarctions. \n+ They tend to *overinterpret* the J-point ST elevation that is commonly seen with early repolarization patterns. As a result — *computerized* systems may be prone to mislabel these normal variants as “acute MI”. \n+ *Computerized* systems may *miss* pacemaker spikes/WPW/*tall* R in V1. They are *unlikely* to appreciate certain clinical entities such as Wellens’ syndrome or DeWinter T waves. \n+ Many hospitals do not utilize *special* computer programs for interpretation of ECGs obtained on *pediatric* patients. Obvious problems with interpretation will arise IF a *pediatric* ECG is interpreted by a computer program using *adult* criteria. \n+ Finally — *computerized *systems by definition lack the *“human Gestalt”* by an expert of the overall tracing. \n\n \n\n**13.2 – *Suggested* Approach: *How to Use the Computer***\n\nThe *most* important point to emphasize in this Section — is that clinical use of the *computerized* report by *non-expert* interpreters should be *very different* than use of this same report by the *expert* who regularly interprets a large volume of tracings. ***Expertise* of the interpreter** therefore ***dictates* the approach we recommend **\\(*Grauer: Practical Guide to ECG Interpretation; Mosby, St. Louis; pp 375-379, 1998*\\).\n\n+ For the ***Non-Expert *Interpreter** — Do *not* initially read the computer report. Instead — *WRITE* OUT \\(*or at least think out*\\) your interpretation first. Only *after* independently making your own interpretation — should you look at the computerized report. At this point — Check *each* of the findings you note with *each* computer statement. Then delete, modify *and/or* add to the computer interpretation as needed. \n+ For the ***Expert *Interpreter** — Review the computer report *either* before or after evaluation of the ECG itself. *Minimize* time devoted to determination of heart rate, intervals and axis \\(*since the computer is very accurate for these parameters*\\). Consider more careful evaluation IF the rhythm is *not* sinus — or IF the ECG is interpreted by the computer as abnormal. Overread *each* computer statement. Place a ***check* mark** next to those that are accurate. Delete, modify or add to incorrect statements. \n\n \n\n***KEY* Point:** The ***expert* interpreter** is *not* using the *computerized* report to “learn”. This is because by definition — the interpretation of an ***expert* electrocardiographer** is the **“gold standard”**. Since computerized systems are programmed by experts — the *best* they can realistically hope for is to put out interpretations that *equal* the level of accuracy of the expert that programmed them.\n\n+ The ***expert*** uses the computer: **i\\)** to save time; and **ii\\)** to prevent overlooking findings when forced to read *many* ECGs in a *limited* period of time. \n+ ***Less experienced* interpreters** do look to the computer to assist in accuracy. They are usually called on to read *no more* than one ECG at any one time. Therefore — the *most* important step for the ***non-expert*** is to first *COVER UP* the computerized report. It is otherwise all too easy to be biased by what the computer says. Used in this way — comparing one’s *own* interpretation with what the computer says *optimally* incorporates potential benefit from any discrepancy in interpretation that may exist. \n\n \n\n**13.3 – FIGURE 13.3-1: *Do You Agree with the Computer?***\n\nPerhaps the *best* way to illustrate potential pros and cons of *computerized* interpretations — is by clinical example. Consider the ECG shown in **Figure 13.3-1** — obtained from a 78 year old woman with *atypical* chest pain.\n\n+ The ***computerized* interpretation** was: Sinus rhythm; left axis \\(*-10 degrees*\\) — but otherwise “normal” ECG. \n+ *Do you agree* with the *computerized* interpretation? \n+ **HINT:** Be sure to interpret this ECG *in its entirety* by the systematic approach first — *before* you compare what the computer said with your interpretation. \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 13.3-1:** ECG obtained from a 78 year old woman with *atypical* chest pain. The **computerized report** interpreted this tracing as, “left axis but otherwise normal”. *Do you agree* with the *computerized* report?\n\n**Answer to Figure 13.3-1:** The rhythm is sinus. All intervals are normal. The axis is leftward \\(*predominantly negative QRS in lead aVF*\\) *— *but *not* negative enough to qualify as LAHB \\(*since the QRS in lead II is still upright*\\). No chamber enlargement.\n\n+ Regarding **Q-R-S-T Changes** — There are **QS complexes** in leads V1,V2. An r wave develops by lead V3 — and transition occurs normally between lead V3-to-V4. Although there is *no more* than minimal \\(*at most*\\) ST elevation — **T waves** are ***dramatically* peaked** in *anterior* precordial leads \\(*especially in lead V2*\\). There is shallow T inversion in lead III, and perhaps some *nonspecific* ST-T wave flattening in lead aVF. \n\n \n\n**IMPRESSION:** This example highlights the importance of *overreading* the *computer*ized interpretation after you have *independently* arrived at your own conclusion. This is *not* a “normal” ECG. That statement should be ***crossed out*** on the computerized report. This is because the *computerized* interpretation is a medical record — and statements you disagree with should therefore be crossed out.\n\n+ ***Clinical* correlation** is needed to determine the meaning of the *abnormal* findings you identified. **Of Concern** — is the fact that **i\\)** this woman is of a “certain age” \\(*78 years old — so clearly old enough to have coronary disease*\\); — and **ii\\)** she is having “chest pain” \\(*even though it is described as “atypical” in nature*\\). \n+ While *not* definitive — the **QS complexes** in leads **V1,V2** could reflect *septal* infarction of *uncertain* age. This should *at least* be noted in your interpretation \\(*it was ignored by the computerized report*\\). \n+ There is ***marked* T wave peaking** — especially in** leads V2,V3**. This is *not* normal \\(*despite also being ignored by the computerized report*\\). Possible explanations for this *abnormal* T wave peaking include: **i\\)** Hyperkalemia \\(*less likely because T wave peaking is not generalized *and* the base of these T waves is not narrow — *but* a serum K\\+ level should nevertheless be checked to rule this out*\\); **ii\\)** Ischemia \\(*which when posterior in location sometimes manifests as anterior T wave peaking*\\); and **iii\\)** DeWinter T waves. Given the history of chest discomfort — we are *most* concerned with this 3rd possibility. While the J-point ST depression that is usually seen with ***DeWinter *T waves** is *missing* in Figure 13.3-1 — the ECG picture in this tracing is otherwise perfectly compatible with this harbinger sign of possible impending *proximal* LAD occlusion \\(*Section 10.58*\\). \n\n \n\n***BOTTOM* Line:** It might be easy to *overlook* the QS complexes in leads V1,V2 of this tracing IF you allowed the computerized report to *bias* you prior to rendering *your own* independent interpretation. Hopefully — you did *not* overlook the obviously abnormal T wave peaking in anterior leads that somehow escaped detection by the computer. Recognition of ***DeWinter* T waves** is indication for *immediate* cath/acute reperfusion — so this possibility mandates *immediate* attention. This would have been *missed* had the computer report been accepted without overread. *Computerized* interpretations can be extremely helpful to *both* expert and *non-expert* interpreters — but knowing *HOW* to use the computer report always assumes *first* priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n**14.0 – Electrical Alternans**\n\n\n\nWe conclude this ECG-2014-ePub with brief comment on the fascinating phenomenon of ***electrical* alternans**. This relatively uncommon clinical entity is frequently misunderstood — and *often* overlooked when it does occur. Electrical alternans is a general term that encompasses a number of *different* pathophysiologic mechanisms. Its occurrence is *not* limited to pericardial tamponade — but instead has been associated with an expanding array of clinical conditions.\n\n+ Distinction should be made between *electrical* and *mechanical* alternans. The term ***“alternans”*** itself — merely indicates that there is ***phasic* fluctuation** in ***some* cardiac signal** from one beat to the next within the cardiac cycle. This may be in the strength of the pulse \\(*or the blood pressure recorded*\\) — or it may be in one or more waveforms in the ECG recording. \n\n \n\n**NOTE:** Discussion is *limited* in this Section 14 to ECG manifestations of alternans. Nevertheless — it may be helpful to first define *other* alternans phenomena that may sometimes be confused with the various ECG manifestations \\(*especially since these other forms of alternans phenomena may also be seen with cardiac tamponade*\\).\n\n+ ***Pulsus* alternans** — is a *mechanical* form of alternans. The rhythm is *regular* — but cardiac output varies from beat-to-beat. It is seen with severe systolic dysfunction. Pulsus alternans should be distinguished from a ***bigeminal* pulse** — in which a *weaker* beat follows the stronger beat by a *shorter* time interval \\(*as occurs when the alternating beat is a PVC, which understandably generates less cardiac output*\\). \n+ Pulsus alternans should also be distinguished from ***pulsus* paradoxus** — in which there is a palpable decrease in pulse amplitude \\(*or a measured drop of \u003e10mm in blood pressure*\\) during quiet inspiration. While pulsus *alternans* and *paradoxus* may both be seen with pericardial tamponade — they are *different* phenomena than the various types of *electrical* alternans. \n\n \n\n**14.1 – Electrical Alternans: *Definition/Features/Mechanisms***\n\nElectrical alternans — is a *beat-to-beat* variation in any one or more parts of the ECG recording. It may occur with *every-other-beat* — or with some other recurring ratio \\(*3:1; 4:1; etc.*\\). Amplitude or direction of the P wave, QRS complex, ST segment *and/or* T wave may all be affected \\(*although P wave alternans is rare*\\). Alternating interval duration \\(*of PR, QRS or QT intervals*\\) may also be seen.\n\n+ ***Electrical* alternans** — was first observed in the laboratory by Herring in 1909. It was reported clinically by Sir Thomas Lewis a year later, who characterized the phenomena as occurring, *“either when the heart muscle is normal but the heart rate is very fast* or *when there is serious heart disease and the rate is normal”*. This 1910 description by Lewis serves well to this day to remind us of the 2 principal clinical situations in which electrical alternans is most often encountered: **i\\)** Supraventricular *reentry* tachycardias; and **ii\\)** Pericardial tamponade. \n\n \n\n**Mechanisms:** There are 3 basic types of electrical alternans phenomena — each relating to a different pathophysiologic mechanism: **i\\)** *Repolarization* alternans; **ii\\)** *Conduction* and *Refractoriness* alternans; and **iii\\)** Alternans due to abnormal cardiac motion. A common cellular mechanism may underlie each of these processes relating to abnormal calcium release or reuptake within the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\n+ ***Repolarization* alternans** — entails *beat-to-beat* variation in the **ST segment** *and/or* **T wave**. Alternation in ST segment appearance \\(*or in the amount of ST elevation or depression*\\) — is often linked to ischemia. In contrast — T wave alternation is more often associated with changes in heart rate or in QT duration \\(*especially when the QT is prolonged*\\). In patients with a long QT — T wave alternans may forebode impending Torsades de Pointes. Both ST segment and T wave alternans have been known to precede malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, this type of electrical alternans may convey important adverse prognostic implications when seen in certain situations. That said — a *variety* of clinical conditions have been associated with ***repolarization* alternans**, such that adverse prognostic implications do not always follow. Among these clinical conditions are congenital long QT syndrome — severe electrolyte disturbance \\(*hypocalcemia; hypokalemia; hypomagnesemia*\\) — alcoholic or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — acute pulmonary embolus — subarachnoid hemorrhage — cardiac arrest and the post-resuscitation period — and various forms of ischemia \\(*spontaneous or induced by treadmill testing or other stimulus*\\). \n+ ***Conduction ***and*** Refractoriness* alternans** — entails variance of impulse propagation along *some* part of the conduction system. This may result from fluctuations in heart rate or in nervous system activity or from pharmacologic treatment. ECG manifestations from this form of alternans may include ***alternating* appearance** of the **P wave**, **QRS complex** or alternating difference in **P-R** or** R-R interval duration**. In particular — QRS alternans during *narrow* SVT rhythms has been associated with ***reentry* tachycardias**. While identification of **QRS alternans** during a *regular* SVT often indicates *retrograde* conduction over an AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\) — this phenomenon has also been seen in patients with simple PSVT/AVNRT that exclusively limits its reentry pathway to the AV Node. Therefore — identification of QRS alternans during a *regular* SVT does *not* prove the existence of an accessory pathway. *Conduction* and *refractoriness* alternans may be seen with *WPW-related* as well as *AV Nodal-dependent* reentry tachycardias — atrial fibrillation — acute pulmonary embolus — myocardial contusion — and severe LV dysfunction. \n+ ***Cardiac Motion* alternans** — is the result of cardiac movement rather than electrical alternation. The most important clinical entity associated with ***motion* alternans** is large pericardial effusion — though motion alternans has also been observed in some cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is important to appreciate that *not* all pericardial effusions produce electrical alternans. Development of ***total* electrical alternans** \\(*of P wave, QRS complex and T wave*\\) — is likely to be a harbinger of ***impending* tamponade**. Unfortunately — the sensitivity of *total* electrical alternans is poor for predicting tamponade \\(ie, *most patients who develop tamponade do not manifest preceding electrical alternans*\\). Therefore — it may be helpful if you see total electrical alternans in a patient with a large pericardial effusion — but failure to see this ECG sign *in no way* rules out the possibility that tamponade is occurring. Echo studies in patients with documented cardiac tamponade confirm that electrical alternans is synchronous with and a direct result of the *pendulous* movement of the heart within the enlarged, *fluid-filled* pericardial sac of a patient with large pericardial effusion \\(*See Section 14.4*\\). \n\n \n\n**14.2 – Electrical Alternans: *KEY Clinical Points***\n\nIn summary, electrical alternans is *not* common — but it *does* occur. You *will* see it. You have probably *already* seen it a number of times *without* even realizing it. ***Electrical* alternans** is a fascinating but *advanced* concept. It is clearly *beyond-the-core* for many who are using this ECG-2014-ePub — but we choose to include it because of its uniqueness and the clinical insights that this fascinating ECG sign may provide.\n\n+ In our experience — ***electrical* alternans** is most often seen in association with ***regular* SVT rhythms**. Seeing it in this context suggests \\(*but does not prove*\\) the existence of an AP \\(*Accessory Pathway*\\). Regardless of whether the mechanism of the *regular* SVT is AVNRT or AVRT — it is likely that ***reentry*** is involved. This conclusion may prove useful in contemplating potential investigative and therapeutic interventions. \n+ In a patient with pericarditis — a large heart on chest X-ray — or simply unexplained dyspnea — recognition of electrical alternans should suggest the possibility of a significant ***pericardial* effusion** that may be associated with tamponade. That said — electrical alternans is a ***nonspecific* ECG sign** that may also indicate myocardial ischemia, LV dysfunction *and/or* possibility of any of a number of *other* precipitating factors. ***BOTTOM* Line:** If you see electrical alternans — Look for an *underlying* clinical condition that may be responsible for this ECG sign. \n+ Development of ***electrical* alternans** per se — conveys *no* adverse prognostic implications *beyond those* associated with severity of the *underlying* disorder. Two exceptions to this general rule are: **i\\)** In a patient with QT prolongation or severe ischemia — recognition of electrical alternans may portend *deterioration* to Torsades or VT/VFib; and **ii\\)** In a patient with a large pericardial effusion — development of ***total* electrical alternans** \\(*of P wave, QRS complex and T wave*\\) suggests there may now be tamponade. \n\n \n\n**14.3 – FIGURE 14.3-1: *Alternans in an SVT Rhythm?***\n\nConsider the 3-lead rhythm strip shown in Figure 14.3-1 — obtained from a patient in a ***regular* SVT rhythm**.\n\n+ Is electrical alternans present? If so — *What* kind \\(ie, *involving the P wave; QRS complex; ST or T wave; or involving the PR or R-R interval?*\\). \n+ What are clinical implications for electrical alternans of this rhythm? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 14.3-1:** 3-lead rhythm strip — obtained from a patient in a *regular* SVT rhythm. Is electrical alternans present? If so — *What* kind? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 14.3-1:** Although we describe the rhythm seen here as a *“regular”* SVT \\(*SupraVentricular Tachycardia*\\) — there appears to be *slight-but-real* phasic variation in the R-R interval occurring every-other-beat \\(*ergo,* ***R-R* alternans**\\). In addition — there is both ***QRS* alternans** \\(*red and blue double arrows in *Figure 14.3-1\\) — and ***T wave *alternans** \\(*red and blue circles*\\). That is — QRS morphology *changes* every-other-beat. This is subtle in lead V1 — but more noticeable in lead V2 where the initial R wave manifests an obvious difference in height from one beat to the next. Similarly — T wave morphology changes every-other beat, with this clearly more noticeable in lead V2 which manifests extra peaking of every-other-T wave \\(*red and blue circles in lead V2*\\).\n\n+ Clinical implications of these forms of electrical alternans in a patient with SVT — are that ***reentry*** is almost certain to be involved in the mechanism. There may or may not be a concealed accessory pathway. \n\n \n\n**14.4 – FIGURE 14.4-1: *Alternans in a Patient with Lung Cancer?***\n\nConsider the 12-lead ECG and accompanying rhythm strip in Figure 14.4-1 — obtained from a longtime smoker who presented with *new-onset* dyspnea. Pulmonary nodules suspicious of cancer had been identified on this patient’s admission chest X-ray. In addition — a *large* heart shadow was seen.\n\n+ Note the *bigeminal* pattern for the ECG in **Figure 14.4-1**. Is the rhythm ventricular bigeminy \\(*every-other-beat a PVC*\\)? \n+ Given the history — What clinical entity should be considered? \n+ What might this patient’s Echocardiogram show? \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 14.4-1:** 12-lead ECG and lead V6 rhythm strip — obtained from a patient with dyspnea and suspected lung cancer. What is the *likely* cause of the *bigeminal* rhythm? \\(*See text*\\).\n\n**Answer to Figure 14.4-1:** There is obvious ***QRS* alternans** — with marked variation in QRS amplitude from beat-to-beat. This is most dramatic in lead V3 — in which there is a 180 degree alternation in QRS direction from one beat to the next.\n\n+ The rhythm is *not* atrial or ventricular bigeminy — because P wave morphology is constant and the P-P interval is perfectly *regular* throughout the tracing. The PR interval remains the same. Therefore — the rhythm is sinus and the change in QRS morphology must be solely the result of ***electrical* alternans**. \n+ ST-T wave morphology does *not* appreciably change from beat-to-beat in any of the 12 leads on this tracing. Thus, alternans appears limited to a change in QRS morphology. \n+ ***Clinical* Note:** Knowing this patient’s history supports our presumption of electrical alternans. The patient is a longtime smoker suspected of having lung cancer. He now presents with acute dyspnea and a large heart shadow on chest X-ray. In view of ***electrical* alternans** on ECG — a large ***pericardial* effusion** with possible tamponade should be suspected. An **Echo** should be done in timely fashion \\(**Figure 14.4-2**\\). \n+ *Beyond-the-Core:* Overall QRS amplitude appears *reduced* in Figure 14.4-1 — especially for *every-other-QRS* complex. The finding of ***low* voltage** in the context of the above history and electrical alternans all support the likelihood of finding a significant pericardial effusion. An **Echo** is the investigative procedure of choice \\(Figure 14.4-2\\). \n\n \n\n\n\n**Figure 14.4-2:** Serial 4-chamber views from the Echo performed on the patient whose ECG was shown in Figure 14.4-1. An extremely large pericardial effusion is seen \\(*arrows*\\). As a result — a *“swinging heart”* pendular motion is set up. This marked *free-floating* displacement of the heart occurs in phasic fashion within the *fluid-filled* pericardial sac — and accounts for the dramatic *beat-to-beat* variability in QRS amplitude and direction that was seen in Figure 14.4-1.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: My appreciation to Jenda Enis Stros for allowing me to use the ECG in Figure 14.3-1 — and to Jason Roediger for allowing me to use the case, ECG and Echo in Figures 14.4-1 and 14.4-2.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.280192951Z","tags":null},"/Polyarteritis-nodosa":{"title":"Polyarteritis nodosa","content":"# Polyarteritis nodosa\n\n* Usually middle-aged males.\n* Hepatitis B seropositivity in 30% of patients.

In left ventricular hypertrophy, there is often a QS deflection or poor R wave progression in the right precordial leads that suggests anterior myocardial infarction. The secondary ST-segment elevation in these leads may be mistaken as a current of injury.\n\n2. In pulmonary emphysema, the R waves in the right precordial and sometimes midprecordial leads become quite small or are absent, suggesting anterior myocardial infarction. These QRS changes are explained by the vertical displacement of the heart secondary to a low-lying diaphragm and the intervention of hyperinflated lungs.\n\n3. The pseudoinfarction pattern may also be seen in patients with pneumothorax. The voltage of the QRS complex may be reduced. QS deflection may appear in the right precordial leads.\n\n4. In pulmonary embolism, the Q waves in lead III (as part of the S1Q3 pattern), and sometimes in lead aVF, that are accompanied by ST-segment and T-wave changes are often interpreted as inferior myocardial infarction. In addition to T-wave inversion, with or without an rSr′ pattern in the right precordial leads due to acute right heart strain, QS complexes with ST-segment elevation may occasionally develop in these leads and mimic acute anterior myocardial infarction.\n\n5. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal Q waves are often seen, especially in the left precordial leads and lead I. These Q waves have been attributed to ventricular septal hypertrophy.\n\n6. Myocardial fibrosis is often responsible for the pseudoinfarction pattern in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, progressive muscular dystrophy, [[Friedreich’s ataxia]], scleroderma, amyloidosis, and primary and metastatic tumors of the heart.\n\n7. QS deflections are often seen in the right precordial leads in patients with complete left bundle branch block in the absence of myocardial infarction.\n\n8. Left anterior hemiblock is occasionally associated with small Q waves in the precordial leads that mimic anterior myocardial infarction.\n\n9. The delta waves in [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]] are frequently interpreted as abnormal Q waves of myocardial infarction.\n\n10. [[Pheochromocytoma]] may be associated with striking ECG changes masquerading as ischemic heart disease.4\n\n11.

The data in patients with stage II disease are controversial, and efforts to select those with clinical features that increase the risk of recurrence have not led to definitive answers about who should and who should not receive adjuvant therapy.\n\nTie and colleagues (2022) have reported on 455 patients with stage II colon cancer who were randomized 2:1 to ctDNA-guided management or standard management and followed for a median of 3 years. Operationally, patients in whom tumor DNA was detected in the blood received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who were negative for tumor DNA were observed. In the standard care arm, the decision to use adjuvant therapy was made on the basis of the presence of certain clinical and pathologic risk factors. The factors indicating increased risk were the presence of mismatch repair proficiency, T4 extension, poor cellular differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, a surgical yield of fewer than 12 lymph nodes, tumor perforation of the bowel, and bowel obstruction.\n\nA total of 28% of patients on the standard management arm received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 15% in whom the decision was ctDNA-guided.

This autoimmune disorder may also cause proptosis (exophthalmos) and pretibial myxedema, neither of which is found in other causes of hyperthyroidism.\nToxic multinodular goiter (MNG) may cause hyperthyroidism, more commonly in older patients.\nUnusual causes include iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (precipitated by drugs such as amiodarone or radiographic contrast media), thyroid adenomas, subacute thyroiditis (painful tender goiter with transient hyperthyroidism), painless thyroiditis (nontender goiter with transient hyperthyroidism, most often seen in the postpartum period), and surreptitious ingestion of thyroid hormone. TSH-induced hyperthyroidism is extremely rare.\nDIAGNOSIS\nClinical Presentation\nHistory\nSymptoms include heat intolerance, weight loss, weakness, palpitations, oligomenorrhea, and anxiety.\nIn the elderly, hyperthyroidism may present with only atrial fibrillation, heart failure, weakness, or weight loss, and a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis.\nPhysical Examination\nSigns include brisk tendon reflexes, fine tremor, proximal weakness, stare, and eyelid lag. Cardiac abnormalities may be prominent, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and exacerbation of coronary artery disease or heart failure.\nKey differentiating physical examination findings (Table 24-2) include the following:\nThe presence of proptosis or pretibial myxedema, seen only in Graves’ disease (although many patients with Graves’ disease lack these signs)\nA diffuse nontender goiter, consistent with Graves’ disease or painless thyroiditis\nRecent pregnancy, neck pain, or recent iodine administration, suggesting causes other than Graves’ disease\nDiagnostic Testing\nIn rare cases, 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) is needed to distinguish Graves’ disease or toxic nodules (in which RAIU is elevated) from postpartum thyroiditis, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, or factitious hyperthyroidism (in which RAIU is very low).\nIn suspected hyperthyroidism, plasma TSH is the best initial diagnostic test.\nA normal TSH level virtually excludes clinical hyperthyroidism. If plasma TSH is low, plasma-free T4 should be measured to determine the severity of hyperthyroidism and as a baseline for therapy. If plasma-free T4 is elevated, the diagnosis of clinical hyperthyroidism is established.\nIf plasma TSH is \u003c0.1 µU/mL but free T4 is normal, the patient may have clinical hyperthyroidism because of elevation of plasma T3 alone, and plasma T3 should be measured in this case.\nMild (or subclinical) hyperthyroidism may suppress TSH to \u003c0.1 µU/mL, and thus suppression of TSH alone does not confirm that symptoms are due to hyperthyroidism.\nTSH may also be suppressed by severe nonthyroidal illness (see Evaluation of Thyroid Function section).\nTABLE 24-2   Differential Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism\nType of Goiter\nDiagnosis\nDiffuse, nontender goiter\nGraves’ disease or painless thyroiditis\nMultiple thyroid nodules\nToxic multinodular goiter\nSingle thyroid nodule\nThyroid adenoma\nTender painful goiter\nSubacute thyroiditis\nNormal thyroid gland\nGraves’ disease, painless thyroiditis, or factitious hyperthyroidism\n \nTREATMENT\nSome forms of hyperthyroidism (subacute or postpartum thyroiditis) are transient and require only symptomatic therapy. A β-adrenergic antagonist (such as atenolol 25–100 mg daily) relieves symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremor, and anxiety, until hyperthyroidism is controlled by definitive therapy or until transient forms of hyperthyroidism subside. The dose is adjusted to alleviate symptoms and tachycardia and then reduced gradually as hyperthyroidism is controlled.\nThree methods are available for definitive therapy (none of which controls hyperthyroidism rapidly): RAI, thionamides, and subtotal thyroidectomy.\nDuring treatment, patients are followed by clinical evaluation and measurement of plasma-free T4. Plasma TSH is useless in assessing the initial response to therapy because it remains suppressed until after the patient becomes euthyroid.\nRegardless of the therapy used, all patients with Graves’ disease require lifelong follow-up for recurrent hyperthyroidism or development of hypothyroidism.\nChoice of definitive therapy\nIn Graves’ disease, RAI therapy is our preferred treatment for almost all patients. It is simple and highly effective but cannot be used in pregnancy (see Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy section). Thionamides achieve long-term control in fewer than half of patients with Graves’ disease, and they carry a small risk of life-threatening side effects (agranulocytosis, liver dysfunction). Thyroidectomy may be used in patients who refuse RAI therapy, have significant Graves’ ophthalmopathy, or who relapse or develop side effects with thionamide therapy.\nOther causes of hyperthyroidism: We prefer to treat toxic nodules with RAI (except in pregnancy or during breastfeeding), though thionamides or partial thyroidectomy can also be used. Transient forms of hyperthyroidism because of thyroiditis should be treated symptomatically with atenolol. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is treated with thionamides and atenolol until the patient is euthyroid. Although treatment of some patients with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism with glucocorticoids has been advocated, nearly all patients with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism respond well to thionamide therapy.\nRAI therapy\nA single dose permanently controls hyperthyroidism in 90% of patients, and further doses can be given if necessary.\nA pregnancy test is done immediately before therapy in potentially fertile women.\nA 24-hour RAIU is usually measured and used to calculate the dose.\nThionamides interfere with RAI therapy and should be stopped at least 3 days before treatment. If iodine treatment has been given, it should be stopped at least 2 weeks before RAI therapy.\nFollow-up: Usually, several months are needed to restore euthyroidism. Patients are evaluated at 4- to 6-week intervals, with assessment of clinical findings and plasma-free T4.\nIf thyroid function stabilizes within the normal range, the interval between follow-up visits is gradually increased to annual intervals.\nIf symptomatic hypothyroidism develops, thyroxine therapy is started (see Hypothyroidism section).\nIf symptomatic hyperthyroidism persists after 6 months, RAI treatment can be repeated.\nSide effects\nHypothyroidism occurs in most patients within the first year and thereafter continues to develop at a rate of approximately 3% per year.\nBecause of the release of stored hormone, a slight rise in plasma T4 may occur in the first 2 weeks after therapy. This development is important only in patients with severe cardiac disease, which may worsen as a result. Such patients should be treated with thionamides to restore euthyroidism and to deplete stored hormone before treatment with RAI.\nThere have been mixed results as to whether RAI has a clinically important effect on the course of Graves’ eye disease, but early treatment to prevent hypothyroidism after RAI seems to be beneficial, and patients should be counseled to stop smoking, as this is a known contributor to worsening of the eye disease.\nIt does not increase the risk of malignancy or cause congenital abnormalities in the offspring of women who conceive after RAI therapy.\nThionamides: Methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. PTU also inhibits extrathyroidal deiodination of T4 to T3. Once thyroid hormone stores are depleted (after several weeks to months), T4 levels decrease. These drugs have no permanent effect on thyroid function. In the majority of patients with Graves’ disease, hyperthyroidism recurs within 6 months after therapy is stopped. Spontaneous remission of Graves’ disease occurs in approximately one-third of patients during thionamide therapy, and in this minority, no other treatment may be needed. Remission is more likely in mild, recent onset hyperthyroidism and if the goiter is small. Because of a better safety profile, methimazole should be used instead of PTU except in specific situations (see the following text).\nInitiation of therapy: Before starting therapy, patients must be warned of side effects and precautions. Usual starting doses are methimazole, 10–40 mg PO daily, or PTU, 100–200 mg PO tid; higher initial doses can be used in severe hyperthyroidism.\nFollow-up: Restoration of euthyroidism takes up to several months.\nPatients are evaluated at 4-week intervals with assessment of clinical findings and plasma-free T4. If plasma-free T4 levels do not fall after 4–8 weeks, the dose should be increased. Doses as high as methimazole, 60 mg PO daily, or PTU, 300 mg PO qid, may be required.\nOnce the plasma-free T4 level falls to normal, the dose is adjusted to maintain plasma-\nfree T4 within the normal range.\nNo consensus exists on the optimal duration of therapy, but periods of 6 months to 2 years are usually used. Patients must be monitored carefully for recurrence of hyperthyroidism after the drug is stopped.\nSide effects are most likely to occur within the first few months of therapy.\nMinor side effects include rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgias, and transient leukopenia.\nAgranulocytosis occurs in 0.3% of patients treated with thionamides. Other life-threatening side effects include hepatitis, vasculitis, and drug-induced lupus erythematosus. These complications usually resolve if the drug is stopped promptly.\nPatients must be warned to stop the drug immediately if jaundice or symptoms suggestive of agranulocytosis develop (e.g., fever, chills, sore throat) and to contact their physician promptly for evaluation. Routine monitoring of the white blood cell count is not useful for detecting agranulocytosis, which develops suddenly.\nSubtotal thyroidectomy: This procedure provides long-term control of hyperthyroidism in most patients.\nSurgery may trigger a perioperative exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, and patients should be prepared for surgery by one of two methods.\nA thionamide is given until the patient is nearly euthyroid. Supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI), 40–80 mg (one to two drops) PO bid, is then added 1–2 weeks before surgery. Both drugs are stopped postoperatively.\nAtenolol (50–100 mg daily) is started 1–2 weeks before surgery. The dose of atenolol is increased, if necessary, to reduce the resting heart rate below 90 bpm and is continued for 5–7 days postoperatively. SSKI is given as mentioned earlier.\nFollow-up: Clinical findings and plasma-free T4 and TSH should be assessed 4–6 weeks after surgery.\nIf thyroid function is normal, the patient is seen at 3 and 6 months and then annually.\nIf symptomatic hypothyroidism develops, thyroxine therapy is started.\nHyperthyroidism persists or recurs in 3%–7% of patients.\nComplications of thyroidectomy include hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Rare complications include permanent vocal cord paralysis, due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and perioperative death. The complication rate appears to depend on the experience of the surgeon.\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism is present when the plasma TSH is below normal but the patient has no symptoms that are definitely caused by hyperthyroidism, and plasma levels of free T4 and T3 are normal.\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism increases the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients older than 65 years and those with heart disease and predisposes to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women; it should be treated in these patients. Treatment should also be considered in asymptomatic individuals without risk factors but with TSH persistently \u003c0.1 µU/mL.\nAsymptomatic young patients with mild Graves’ disease can be observed for spontaneous resolution of hyperthyroidism or the development of symptoms or increasing free T4 levels that warrant treatment.\nUrgent therapy is warranted when hyperthyroidism exacerbates heart failure or acute coronary syndromes and in rare patients with severe hyperthyroidism complicated by fever and delirium (thyroid storm). Concomitant diseases should be treated intensively, and confirmatory tests (serum TSH and free T4) should be obtained before therapy is started.\nPTU 300 mg PO q6h or methimazole 60 mg/d PO should be started immediately.\nIodide (SSKI, two drops PO q12h) should be started to inhibit thyroid hormone secretion rapidly.\nPropranolol, 40 mg PO q6h (or an equivalent dose IV), should be given to patients with angina or myocardial infarction, and the dose should be adjusted to prevent tachycardia. β-Adrenergic antagonists may benefit some patients with heart failure and marked tachycardia but can further impair left ventricular systolic function. In patients with clinical heart failure, it should be given only with careful monitoring of left ventricular function.\nPlasma-free T4 is measured every 4–6 days. When free T4 approaches the normal range, the doses of methimazole and iodine are gradually decreased. RAI therapy can be scheduled 2–4 weeks after iodine is stopped.\nHyperthyroidism in pregnancy: If hyperthyroidism is suspected, plasma TSH should be measured. Plasma TSH declines in early pregnancy but rarely to \u003c0.1 µU/mL due to the stimulatory effect of hCG on TSH receptors.\nIf TSH is \u003c0.1 µU/mL, the diagnosis should be confirmed by measurement of plasma-free T4.\nRAI is contraindicated in pregnancy, and therefore, patients should be treated with PTU in the first trimester because of its lower risk of severe congenital defects, whereas methimazole can be used in later pregnancy. The dose should be adjusted at 4-week intervals to maintain the plasma-free T4 near the upper limit of the normal range to avoid fetal hypothyroidism. The dose required often decreases in the later stages of pregnancy.\n## Goiter, Thyroid Nodules, and Thyroid Carcinoma6,7\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nThe evaluation of goiter is based on palpation of the thyroid and evaluation of thyroid function. If the thyroid is enlarged, the examiner should determine whether the enlargement is diffuse or nodular. Both forms of goiter are common, especially in women.\nThyroid scans and ultrasonography (US) provide no useful additional information about goiters that are diffused by palpation and should not be performed in these patients. In contrast, all palpable thyroid nodules should be evaluated by US.\nIn rare patients, more commonly in those with MNG, the gland compresses the trachea or esophagus, causing dyspnea or dysphagia, and treatment is required. Thyroxine treatment has little, if any, effect on the size of MNGs. Subtotal thyroidectomy is most commonly used to relieve compressive symptoms. RAI therapy will reduce gland size and relieve symptoms in most patients if surgery is not an option, though much higher doses are necessary if the patient is euthyroid.\nDiffuse goiter\nAlmost all euthyroid diffuse goiters in the United States are due to chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis). Because Hashimoto thyroiditis may also cause hypothyroidism, plasma TSH should be measured.\nDiffuse euthyroid goiters are usually asymptomatic, and therapy is seldom required. Patients should be monitored regularly for the development of hypothyroidism.\nDiffuse hyperthyroid goiter is most commonly because of Graves’ disease, and treatment of the hyperthyroidism usually improves the goiter (see Hyperthyroidism section).\nNodular goiter\nBetween 30% and 50% of people have nonpalpable thyroid nodules that are detectable by ultrasound. These nodules rarely have any clinical importance, but their incidental discovery may lead to unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment.\nNodules are more common in older patients, especially women, and 5%–10% of thyroid nodules are thyroid carcinomas.\nDIAGNOSIS\nClinical Presentation\nHistory\nClinical findings that increase the risk of carcinoma include the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, a history of radiation to the head or neck, and a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes type 2A or 2B.\nPhysical Examination\nA hard, fixed nodule, recent nodule growth, or hoarseness due to vocal cord paralysis suggests malignancy.\nDiagnostic Testing\nAll patients with one or more palpable thyroid nodules on examination or thyroid nodules identified by other imaging modality should undergo a dedicated thyroid ultrasound as this is the most informative imaging for malignancy risk in thyroid nodules.\nGuidelines from the American Thyroid Association classify malignancy risk and biopsy recommendations based on nodule characteristics and size.\nNodules are characterized into the following risk classes based on their ultrasound appearance: high suspicion (\u003e70%–90% malignancy risk), intermediate suspicion (10%–20% malignancy risk), low suspicion (5%–10% malignancy risk), very low suspicion (\u003c3% malignancy risk), and benign (\u003c1% malignancy risk).\nHigh and intermediate suspicion nodules warrant evaluation by fine needle aspiration (FNA) when they are \u003e1 cm. Low suspicion nodules should be evaluated at \u003e1.5 cm and very low risk nodules at 2 cm. Benign nodules require no further follow-up.\nIn a few patients, hyperthyroidism develops as a result of “toxic” nodules that overproduce thyroid hormone (see Hyperthyroidism section). These nodules can be identified with a radionuclide scan and do not require FNA evaluation as the malignancy risk is only 1%–2%.\nTREATMENT\nPatients with thyroid carcinoma or suspicion for thyroid carcinoma by FNA cytology typically initially undergo surgical resection with either hemi- or total thyroidectomy, sometimes followed by adjuvant therapy with RAI and should be managed in consultation with an endocrinologist.\nFOLLOW-UP\nFurther follow-up depends on FNA results. Benign nodules should undergo repeat ultrasound depending on initial ultrasound risk: high risk in 6–12 months and low-intermediate in 12–24 months. The utility of following very low risk nodules is unclear. Nodules with benign cytology should also be reevaluated periodically by palpation. Thyroxine therapy has little or no effect on the size of thyroid nodules and is not indicated.\nNodules with nondiagnostic cytology because of insufficient sampling should undergo repeat biopsy.\nThe management of thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology is less clear. Nodules with atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion by cytology can be further evaluated with molecular diagnostic testing to estimate risk and guide surgical decision-making.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.29219385Z","tags":null},"/Weaning-from-Mechanical-Ventilation":{"title":"Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation","content":"# Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation\n\n- 肺損傷穩定或消退\n- 充分的氣體交換，呼氣末正壓 (PEEP) 和吸入氧分數 (FiO 2 ) 要求低（例如，PEEP \u003c 5–8 cm H2O，FiO 2 \u003c 0.4–0.5）\n- 血流動力學穩定性（例如，不需要升壓或斷奶，並且沒有嚴重的心律失常）\n- 能夠啟動吸氣努力的患者\n## ✨ 學習重點 🦎\n- 上述標準應作為斷奶篩查每天進行評估。對於通過每日斷奶篩查的患者，首先進行初步的簡短試驗或準備情況評估，在此期間對患者進行 1 至 5 分鐘的密切觀察，同時接受最少或不接受支持（持續氣道正壓通氣 [CPAP] ≤ 5 cm H 2 O)，評估他們進行正式自主呼吸試驗 (SBT) 的能力。\n- 如果患者在準備情況評估期間表現良好，則進行大約 30 分鐘的 SBT。\n- 在此期間，密切監測患者呼吸功能不全、血流動力學惡化、氣體交換問題或患者不適的跡象。\n- 如果出現問題，將立即重新啟動全面的呼吸機支持。\n- 成功完成 SBT 可高度預測成功停用呼吸機。\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.29219385Z","tags":null},"/What-are-the-most-commonly-encountered-fever-patterns":{"title":"What are the most commonly encountered fever patterns","content":"# What are the most commonly encountered fever patterns\n\n- Sustained or continued (little variability from day to day): this used to be the pattern of lobar pneumonia , steady until abruptly resolving by either crisis or death.

A relapsing fever is usually infectious (brucellosis, borreliosis, or relapsing typhoid, but also tuberculosis [TB]), but can occur in Hodgkin’s disease or familial Mediterranean fever.\n\n## ✨重點:\n- 持續或持續（每天變化很小）：這曾經是大葉性肺炎的模式，穩定，直到突然因危機或死亡而消退。 如今，持續模式主要見於革蘭氏陰性膿毒症，但也見於中樞神經系統 (CNS) 疾病。\n- 間歇性：在劇集之間完全解決（見下文）。\n- 緩解：每天都在減輕，但仍未完全解決。 這曾經是傷寒的模式。\n- 復發：伴隨一系列發熱發作，每次持續數天，且均以大致相同長度的無發熱間隔分開。回歸熱通常具有傳染性（布魯氏菌病、疏螺旋體病或複發性傷寒，還有結核病 [TB]），但也可能發生在霍奇金病或家族性地中海熱中。\n \n[[hectic fever]]\n[[Pel-Ebstein fever]]\n[[factitious fever]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.29219385Z","tags":null},"/When-to-suspect-migraine":{"title":"When to suspect migraine","content":"# When to suspect migraine\n\n* Recurrent headache of moderate to severe intensity\n* Visual aura\n* Family history of migraine\n* Onset of symptoms at or around puberty\n\nIn the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: \n* migraine without aura\n* migraine with aura\n* chronic migraine\n\n## Types of migraine\n* [[Migraine without aura]]\n* [[Migraine with aura]]\n* [[Chronic migraine]]\n* [[Family history of migraine]]\n\n## Recommendations\nSuspect migraine without aura in a person with recurrent moderate to severe headache, particularly if pain is unilateral and/or pulsating, and when the person has accompanying symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and/or vomiting.\n\nSuspect migraine with aura in a person with the symptoms above and recurrent, short-lasting visual and/or hemisensory disturbances.\n\nSuspect chronic migraine in a person with ≥15 headache days per month.\n\nSuspicion of migraine should be strengthened by a family history of migraine and if onset of symptoms is at or around puberty.\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.29219385Z","tags":null},"/When-to-treat-chronic-HBV-with-anti-virals":{"title":"When to treat chronic HBV with anti-virals","content":"# When to treat chronic HBV with anti-virals\n\n (1) immune active phase; (2) HBeAg ⊖ chronic hepatitis B; (3) cirrhosis w/ HBV DNA ≥2K; (4) decomp. cirrhosis due to hep B; (5) acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis B; (6) special pop: preg (3rd trimester w/ HBV DNA ≥200k), inactive carriers treated w/ immunosuppression, HCC, HCV co-infection\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.29219385Z","tags":null},"/Whipples-disease":{"title":"Whipple’s disease","content":"# Whipple’s disease\n\ninfxn w/ T. whipplei (Lancet 2016;16:13)\n\nOther s/s: fever, LAN, edema, arthritis, CNS Δs, gray-brown skin pigmentation, AI \u0026 MS, oculomasticatory myorhythmia (eye oscillations + mastication muscle contract).\n\nDx: bx/path, IHC, PCR.

Use a validated CDR\n1.  Investigators construct a list of potential predictors of a disease, and then examine a group of patients to determine whether the predictors and the disease are present.\na.  Logistic regression is then used to determine which predictors are most powerful and which can be omitted.\nb.  The model is then validated by applying it in other patient populations.\nc.  To simplify use, the clinical predictors in the model are often assigned point values, and different point totals correspond to different pretest probabilities.\n2.  CDRs are infrequently available but are the most precise way of estimating pretest probability.\n3.  If you can find a validated CDR, you can come up with an exact number (or a small range of numbers) for your pretest probability.\nB.  Use information about the prevalence of etiologies for a symptom.\n1.  You can sometimes find this information in textbooks or review articles.\n2.  It is important to assess the quality of any studies you find before using the data.\nC.  Use your overall clinical impression.\n1.  This is a combination of what you know about disease prevalence and the match between the expected history and physical with that of the patient, mixed with your clinical experience, and the ever elusive attribute “clinical judgment.”\n2.  This is just as imprecise as it sounds, and it has been shown that physicians are disproportionately influenced by their most recent clinical experience.\n3.  Nevertheless, it has also been shown that the overall clinical impression of experienced clinicians has significant predictive value.\n4.  Clinicians generally categorize pretest probability as low, moderate, or high. This rather vague categorization is still helpful.

Additional adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation is considered in certain cases.\n\nSurgical and nonsurgical options may be appropriate depending on the depth of tumor and/or extent of disease.

Furadantin, Macrobid\n\n## Usage and Dosing\n\n*   Nitrofurantoin is used to treat uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTI), e.g., cystitis, urethritis.\n*   Not effective for infections outside of the urinary tract.\n*   Because nitrofurantoin is a weak acid with a pKa of 7.2, absorption is enhanced in an acidic environment. Renal clearance is enhanced in an alkaline environment ([Urology 1988;32:67](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/3291373/)).\n*   Increased activity in acidic urine.\n*   Original capsules contain microcrystals of nitrofurantoin, marketed in US as Furadantin. To decrease frequency of nausea, the drug was later formulated in macrocrystalline form (marketed as Macrodantin). Subsequently a slow release formulation was developed (25% macrocrystals, 75% monohydrate), marketed as Macrobid. As the name implies, administered bid.\n*   Long-standing admonition to not use in patients with CrCl \u003c50-60 mL/min for fear of inadequate urine concentrations and/or increased adverse effects. However, in retrospective study, there was no difference in the safety and efficacy of nitrofurantoin in patients with CrCl ≤50 mL/min or CrCl \u003e50 mL/min. **Current American Geriatric Society recommendation is that nitrofurantoin can be used with relative safety and efficacy in patients with CrCl \u003e30 mL/min** [(J Am Geriatr Soc 67:674, 2019)](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/30693946/). Not effective in end-stage renal disease.\n*   Pregnancy risk and lactation safety\n    *   **Contraindicated** in pregnant patients at term (38 to 42 weeks gestation), during labor and delivery, or when the onset of labor is imminent (the drug can cause hemolytic anemia in the newborn). For the same reason, the drug is contraindicated in neonates under one month of age.\n    *   See [Table](https://webedition-sanfordguide-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/en/comparisons-1/pregnancy risk lactation safety).\n*   Systematic Review: [J Antimicrob Chemother 70:2456, 2015](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org:2048/pubmed?term=%22The+Journal+of+antimicrobial+chemotherapy%22%5BJour%5D+AND+70%5Bvolume%5D+AND+2456%5Bpage%5D\u0026cmd=detailssearch)\n\n### Adult Dose\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eActive UTI\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e(Furadantin or Macrodantin) 50-100 mg po qid x 5-7 days or for at least 3 days after sterile urine achieved\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e(Macrobid) 100 mg po bid x 5-7 days\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eUTI Prophylaxis\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e(Furadantin or Macrodantin) 50-100 mg po at bedtime\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n### Pediatric Dose\n\n*   Age \u003e 28 days\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eOral dose: Cystitis\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e5-7 mg/kg/day (divided q 6h)\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003ctr\u003e\u003ctd\u003eOral Dose: UTI prophylaxis\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e1-2 mg/kg/day (once daily)\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\n\n### Renal Adjustment\n\n*   CrCl \u003e50 mL/min: Give usual dose\n*   CrCl \u003c50 mL/min: See comment\n\n### Hepatic Adjustment\n\n*   None\n\n### Adverse Effects\n\n*   Rare but serious liver injury.\n*   Peripheral neuropathy can occur.\n*   May impart a brown color to the urine.\n*   Interstitial pneumonitis with progressive fibrosis can occur, usually after 6 months of therapy.\n*   Hemolytic anemia if G6PD-deficient.\n*   DRESS syndrome: Drug rash, eosinophilia, systemic symptoms hypersensitivity syndrome reported ([Neth J Med 67:147, 2009](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org:2048/pubmed?term=%22The+Netherlands+journal+of+medicine%22%5BJour%5D+AND+67%5Bvolume%5D+AND+147%5Bpage%5D\u0026cmd=detailssearch)).\n*   In retrospective study, Nitrofurantoin was associated with increased risk of birth defects ([Arch Ped Adol Med 163:978, 2009](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org:2048/pubmed?term=%22Archives+of+pediatrics+%26+adolescent+medicine%22%5BJour%5D+AND+163%5Bvolume%5D+AND+978%5Bpage%5D\u0026cmd=detailssearch)); in contrast, subsequent study shows no risk of major malformations after exposure to Nitrofurantoin during the first trimester ([J Clin Pharmacol 53:991, 2013](http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.autorpa.kfsyscc.org:2048/pubmed/23873250)).\n\n## Antimicrobial Spectrum\n\n## Pharmacology\n\n| Class | Nitrofuran |\n| --- | --- |\n| PK/PD Index | No data |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pharmaceutical  \nPreparation | Macrocrystalline cap (25, 50, 100 mg)  \nOral susp (25 mg/5 ml)  \nSlow-release cap (100 mg) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Food Effect\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e | Take all preps with food |\n| Oral  \nAbsorption\u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e (%) | 80-90 |\n| Tmax (hr) | No data |\n| Peak Serum Conc\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e  \n(μg/mL) | \u003c1 |\n| Peak Urine Conc  \n(μg/mL) | 50-200 (100 mg, SD) |\n| Protein Binding (%) | No data |\n| Average Serum  \nHalf-life\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e (hr) | 0.5-2 |\n| Elimination | Renal, metabolism |\n| Biliary Penetration\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e (%) | No data |\n| CSF/Blood  \nPenetration\u003csup\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e (%) | No data |\n| Therapeutic Levels in CSF\u003csup\u003e7\u003c/sup\u003e | No |\n| Volume of Distribution\u003csup\u003e8\u003c/sup\u003e  \n(Vd) | No data |\n| AUC\u003csup\u003e9 \u003c/sup\u003e (μg\\*hr/mL) | 1-3 (100 mg, 0-inf) |\n| CYP450, Transporter Interactions | None known |\n\n*   Notes:\n    \n    *   SD = after single dose\n    *   SS = steady state after multiple doses\n    \n    *   V/F = Vd/oral bioavailability\n    *   Vss = Vd at steady state\n    *   Vss/F = Vd at steady state/oral bioavailability\n\n*   \u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e Adult preparations unless otherwise noted.\n*   \u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e Absorption under optimal conditions.\n*   \u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e Total drug; adjust for protein binding to determine free drug concentration.\n*   \u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e Assumes CrCl \u003e 80 mL/min\n*   \u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e Peak concentration in bile/peak concentration in serum x 100\n*   \u003csup\u003e6\u003c/sup\u003e CSF levels with inflammation\n*   \u003csup\u003e7\u003c/sup\u003e Judgment based on drug dose \u0026 organism susceptibility.

Type and dose of agents determine this balance.\n\nMyeloablative conditioning: high-dose chemo and/or total body irradiation. Low relapse rates, high immunosuppression, higher transplant-related morbidity.\n\nReduced-intensity conditioning (“RIC”): lower dose of chemo → ↓ transplant-related morbidity/mortality, but ↑ relapse b/c it relies more on GVT effect (Blood 2015;126:23).

However, some general tips on how to treat cancer may include:\n\n- Finding an experienced and reputable oncologist or cancer center.\n\n- Getting a second opinion from another oncologist or cancer center.\n\n- Learning about the side effects of various cancer treatments.\n\n- Seeking support from family and friends.\n\nWhat is exon 20 deletion?\n\nExon 20 deletion is a type of genetic mutation. It is a deletion of the DNA base pair sequence \"CT\" in the exon 20 region of the TP53 gene. This particular mutation is associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, specifically breast cancer.\n\nWhat is pathophysiology of contrast induced kidney injury?\n\nThere are many potential mechanisms for contrast induced kidney injury, but the most likely one is that the contrast agent causes vasoconstriction of the renal arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen to the kidneys. This can cause cell death and damage to the kidney tissue.\n\n## What is the first line chemotherapy regimen of small cell lung cancer:\n\nThe first line chemotherapy regimen of small cell lung cancer is typically a combination of drugs, such as cisplatin and etoposide.\n\nGive me a outline of lung cancer treatment \n\nLung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. The most common type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Treatment for lung cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nKey points of surgery of lung cancer:\n\n1. The most common type of surgery for lung cancer is a lobectomy, which involves removing the entire lobe of the lung that contains the tumor.\n\nWhat is lobectomy? \n\nA lobectomy is a type of surgery that involves removing an entire lobe of the lungs. This can be done to treat cancer or other conditions that affect the lungs.\n\n2. Other types of surgery include a wedge resection (removing a small section of the lung), a segmentectomy (removing a portion of a lobe), and a pneumonectomy (removing an entire lung).\nWhat is wedge resection? \n\nA wedge resection is a surgical procedure in which a wedge-shaped section of tissue is removed from the body. The removed tissue may be a tumor or other abnormal growth.\n\n3. Surgery is usually the first line of treatment for lung cancer, but may be combined with other treatments such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\n\n4. The success of surgery depends on many factors, including the size and location of the tumor, the stage of the cancer, and the overall health of the patient.\n\nStaging of lung cancer \n\n1. Cancer that is confined to the lungs and has not spread to other parts of the body is referred to as stage I, II, or III lung cancer.\n\nWhat is stage III lung cancer \n\nStage III lung cancer is a type of lung cancer that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.\n\n2. Cancer that has spread from the lungs to nearby tissues or organs is referred to as stage IV lung cancer.\n\nRisk factor of lung cancer \n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85 percent of all cases.\n\nAll risk factors associated with lung cancer \n\n1. Smoking: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases. \n2. Exposure to secondhand smoke: People who are exposed to secondhand smoke (smoke from other people's cigarettes) have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. \n3. Asbestos: Asbestos is a type of insulation that was used in many homes and buildings before it was banned in 1978. People who work with asbestos or who live in homes with asbestos insulation have an increased risk of developing lung cancer. \n4. Air pollution: Air pollution, both outdoors and indoors, is a risk factor for lung cancer. \n5. Radon: Radon is a gas that can be found in some homes and buildings. It is produced when\n\nPathophysiology of hyperkalemia \n\nHyperkalemia is a condition in which the level of potassium in the blood is above the normal range. Potassium is a mineral that is essential for the proper functioning of the cells, tissues, and organs in the body. The normal range for potassium is 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L. A level of potassium above 5.0 mEq/L is considered to be high.\n\nHyperkalemia can be caused by a variety of conditions, including kidney disease, diabetes, and certain medications. Symptoms of hyperkalemia include muscle weakness, paralysis, and irregular heartbeat. Hyperkalemia can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n\nMedication that cause hyperkalemia\n\nSome of the medications that can cause hyperkalemia include: ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics.\n\nzh-HantRelation of beta blockers and hyperkalemia \n\n[translation error]\n\nThe main treatment for acute hyperkalemia is intravenous administration of glucose and insulin. This will help to lower the level of potassium in the blood.\n\nCreate a outline of treatment of hyperkalemia in  patients\n\n1. Identify the cause of hyperkalemia.\n2. if the patient is symptomatic, treat with iv fluids and potassium-binding agents.\n3. If the patient is asymptomatic, monitor potassium levels and treat with dietary changes and/or medication changes as needed.","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/test202207":{"title":"test202207","content":"Test","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/testing":{"title":"testing","content":"- q1\n\t- answer\n\u003c!--ID: 1660789479810--\u003e\n\n- q2\n\t- answer\n\u003c!--ID: 1660789479816--\u003e\n\n* lsit\n* list*\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/testing-1":{"title":"testing 1","content":"## testing","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/thereis":{"title":"thereis","content":"# thereis\n\n\n----\n來自: [[emergency medicine]]\n----\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/this-is-a-book":{"title":"this is a book","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/three-component-friction-rub":{"title":"three-component friction rub","content":"# three-component friction rub\n\n## ✨ 學習重點 🦎\n- (1) 一種發生在收縮期的任何地方，儘管最常見於收縮中期（因此對應於心室收縮）；\n- (2) 兩個發生在舒張早期和晚期（因此分別對應於早期心室充盈和心房收縮）。\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-17T08:17:36.316195647Z","tags":null},"/thromboangiitis-obliterans":{"title":"thromboangiitis obliterans","content":"# thromboangiitis obliterans\n\n# Buerger disease\n\n* Heavy tobacco smoking history, males \u003c 40 years old.\n* Intermittent claudication.
