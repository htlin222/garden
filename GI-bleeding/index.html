His symptoms started 2 hours ago.</p><p><strong>What is the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding? How would you frame the differential?</strong></p><a href=#constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=constructing-a-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The approach to GI bleeding is similar to the approach to other potentially life-threatening illnesses. Patient stabilization, specifically, hemodynamic stabilization is the first step in management. In a patient with significant GI bleeding, management precedes diagnosis, usually made by colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The pivotal point in the differential, post stabilization, is distinguishing between an upper or lower GI source for blood loss. From there, by using severity of the bleed, patient demographics and assessing risk factors for bleeding sources, one can narrow down the differential further.</p><p>Initial management follows a regimented course. First, the patient must have a risk assessment for the severity of bleeding and preparation must be made for resuscitation if further bleeding occurs. This is followed by hemodynamic stabilization and completion of initial diagnostic and therapeutic testing.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Risk assessment</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The best risk assessment tool for upper GI bleed is the Glasgow-Blatchford Score.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The score includes variables such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, blood pressure, heart rate.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Low scores identify low-risk patients who potentially can be treated as an outpatient.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  A score of 0 has LR– of 0.02 for need for urgent endoscopic intervention equating to a very low-risk patient.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  For lower GI bleeding, the following patient factors predict poor outcomes (increased risk of mortality, adverse outcomes or re-bleeding):</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Initial hematocrit &lt; 35%; OR 6.3</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Age > 60; OR 4.2</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Gross blood on rectal exam; OR 3.9</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Heart rate > 100 bpm; OR 3.7</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Systolic pressure blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg; OR 3.0</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Preparation for hemodynamic stabilization, resuscitation, and further bleeding</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  All patients should have their blood typed and be cross-matched for at least 2 units of packed red blood cells.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Two large bore IVs</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  IVs should be ≤ 16 gauge.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Because flow = ΔP (πr4/8μL) (where ΔP is the pressure differential, r is the radius of the IV, μ is the viscosity of the fluid, and L is the length of the IV), flow can be maximized by</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Increasing the pressure behind the fluid being infused (squeezing the bag).</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Decreasing the length of the IV.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Increasing the gauge of the IV (the most effective as the flow goes up by the fourth power of any increase).</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Large gauge IVs (16 and larger) are much more effective than central lines for volume resuscitation.</p><p>Always make sure your patient has 2 usable large bore IVs, so you do not have to worry about IV access should life-threatening bleeding develop.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  In the setting of severe hemorrhage, a urinary catheter, with regular monitoring of urinary output, helps monitor the adequacy of volume resuscitation.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Hemodynamic stabilization</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Clinically assess volume status.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Signs of shock may be seen with 30–40% volume depletion.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Orthostasis can be seen with 20–25% volume depletion.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Tachycardia may be present with 15% volume depletion.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Calculate necessary replacement (weight in kg × 0.6 (lean body weight made up of water) × % volume depletion).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Replace fluid losses initially with normal saline or Ringer solution.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Consider the need for blood transfusion.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  There is general agreement on the following recommendations for transfusion in actively bleeding patients.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Patients should receive a blood transfusion when there has been 30% loss of blood volume (manifested by tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, decreased urinary output, or CNS symptoms [eg, anxiety/confusion]).</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Alternatively, if 2 L of crystalloid have been given without successful resuscitation, blood should be transfused.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  If a Hb level is available, actively bleeding patients should receive a transfusion when the level falls below 9 g/dL because it can take time for the Hb to accurately reflect ongoing blood loss.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  If large amounts of blood are needed (> 4 units of packed red blood cells), fresh frozen plasma and platelets should also be given.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  In patients who are not bleeding, withholding transfusions until the Hb is &lt; 7 g/dL is appropriate.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  This recommendation is based mainly on a study that demonstrated a mortality benefit associated with a restrictive transfusion strategy.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  The exclusion criteria in this study were massive exsanguinating bleeding, an acute coronary syndrome, symptomatic peripheral vasculopathy, stroke, or transient ischemic attack.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  All patients had endoscopy within 6 hours of presentation.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Patients in this study also received blood if symptoms of anemia or massive bleeding developed or if they required surgery.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  In patients with cardiovascular disease, a transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL is probably appropriate.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  It is important to remember that patients may initially have a normal hemoglobin level when they present with an acute hemorrhage. Hemoglobin level will only fall after fluid resuscitation.</p><p>Even after a large hemorrhage, patients may initially have a normal Hb level. The level will only fall after fluid resuscitation.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Review the patient’s medication list for antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications. The decision to reverse an anticoagulant is based on a careful balancing of the severity of bleeding versus the need for anticoagulation.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  If there is concern for an upper GI bleed, empirically start an IV proton pump inhibitor or octreotide or both based on risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and variceal bleeding.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  IV proton pump inhibitors help reduce the number of endoscopic interventions and risk of re-bleeds in peptic ulcer disease without a mortality benefit.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Intermittent IV or oral bolus dosing of proton pump inhibitors is probably equivalent, if not superior to, continuously delivered proton pump inhibitor.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Initial diagnostic tests</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  CBC and platelet count</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Basic metabolic panel (chem-7)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Liver biochemical tests (Abnormal results raise the risk of underlying severe liver disease and thus coagulopathy and varices.)</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Upright chest radiograph</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Most important if there is abdominal tenderness to assess for free air in the abdomen arising from a perforated viscus</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Patients taking immunosuppressants (including corticosteroids) may have free air in the abdomen with only mild abdominal symptoms.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Radiographs may, infrequently, provide other diagnostic clues.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Nasogastric (NG) tube placement, which was once considered standard, is now controversial.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  An NG tube is a minimally invasive way to assess the acuity of bleeding and to help localize its source.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Blood or coffee grounds in an NG aspirate is indicative of an upper GI bleed (LR+, 9.6).</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  On the other hand, a negative lavage does not exclude an upper GI source.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Research has suggested that NG tube placement does not change patient outcomes (mortality, length of stay, volume of transfused blood, need for surgery).</p><p>The differential diagnosis of GI bleeding is based on an anatomic framework. Upper GI bleeds originate proximal to the ligament of Treitz, while lower GI bleeds originate from areas distal to the ligament and are primarily colonic. Therefore, the pivotal points in a patient’s evaluation are characteristics that argue for an upper or lower GI source. Among others, these include history of previous upper or lower bleeding episodes, epigastric pain, melena, and blood in an NG lavage, all of which suggest an upper GI bleed. The causes of upper and lower GI bleeding are arranged below in the approximate order of frequency. Bleeding from a small bowel source is less common. The last category is anorectal bleeding. These are generally smaller bleeds with limited potential to cause hemodynamic instability.</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Upper GI bleeds</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Common</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Peptic ulcer disease</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Esophageal or gastric varices</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Mallory-Weiss tear</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Less common</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Angiodysplasia</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Gastritis</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Malignancy</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Esophagitis</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Dieulafoy lesion</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Lower GI bleeds</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Common</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Diverticulosis</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Malignancy or polyp</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Colitis</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Inflammatory</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Infectious</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Ischemic</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Colonic angiodysplasia</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Less common small bowel sources</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Angiodysplasia</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Ulcers</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Malignancy</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  Crohn disease</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Meckel diverticulum</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Anorectal bleeding</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Hemorrhoids</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Anal fissures</p><p>Mr. T was well until this morning. Abdominal cramping developed while he was eating breakfast. He did not have nausea. He went to the bathroom and passed a large bowel movement of stool mixed with blood. Afterward, he felt better and went to lie down. About 30 minutes later, he had the same sensation and this time passed what he described as “about a pint” of bright red blood. While getting up from the toilet, he became dizzy and had to sit on the bathroom floor for 15 minutes before he could crawl to the phone to dial 911.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis? Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>The lack of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, and the presence of bright red blood per rectum are pivotal points in this case and make a lower GI source most likely. Cramping is often seen with GI bleeds, caused by blood passing through the bowel. The patient’s age, acuity, and volume of blood makes bleeding from diverticuli, colitis, malignancy, or angiodysplasia the most likely diagnoses. Whether he has had a recent change in bowel habits, weight loss, or previous bloody stools is unknown; all these factors would heighten suspicion for colitis or malignancy. The amount of blood loss and symptomatic dizziness make hemorrhoids or fissures unlikely. Upper sources of bleeding must also be considered. A brisk bleed from an upper source can present with bright red blood per rectum. Assuming there is no history of liver disease, peptic ulcer disease would be the most likely upper source. Table 19-1 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 19-1.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. T.</p><p>Blood is a cathartic. A brisk bleed from an upper source can present with bright red blood per rectum.</p><p>Mr. T reports no recent illness or change in bowel habits. He reports no family history of colon cancer, and he has never had a colonoscopy. He has a fifty-pack year smoking history and quit about 6 years ago. He reports drinking 2–4 beers each night.</p><p>On physical exam, Mr. T looks anxious but is otherwise well. While sitting, his BP is 120/92 mm Hg and his pulse is 100 bpm. While standing, his BP is 100/80 mm Hg and his pulse is 122 bpm. His temperature is 37.0°C and his RR is 16 breaths per minute. There is no conjunctival pallor. Lungs and heart exams are normal. There are hyperactive bowel sounds but the abdomen is soft, nontender, and with no organomegaly. Rectal exam reveals bright red blood.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Other than frank hematemesis, only a few features are strongly predictive in localizing the site of bleeding to the upper or lower tract. These are outlined in Table 19-2.</p><p><strong>Table 19-2.</strong> Test characteristics of clinical findings for upper vs lower GI bleeding.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Patients who are volume depleted, orthostatic, or hypotensive are about twice as likely to have an upper GI bleed than a lower GI bleed.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Because urea is produced as blood is processed throughout the GI tract, a BUN/creatinine ratio > 30 suggests an upper GI source (sensitivity, 39%; specificity, 94%; LR+, 7.5; LR−, 0.64**)**</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Although hematochezia generally suggests a lower GI source of bleeding, 10–15% of patients with hematochezia have an upper GI source. These patients are more likely to be older and to have duodenal ulcers.</p><p>10–15% of patients with hematochezia have an upper GI source of bleeding.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Beyond differentiating between upper and lower sources of GI bleeding, certain historical features may point to a specific diagnosis (Table 19-3).</p><p><strong>Table 19-3.</strong> Historical features in the diagnosis of GI bleeding.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  These features should be sought in every patient with GI bleeding.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  They are, however, only suggestive and by no means diagnostic.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Endoscopy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  In a patient with GI bleeding, EGD is usually recommended as the first procedure unless the suspicion for a lower GI bleed is very high (based on history and, possibly, a negative NG tube aspirate). This recommendation is based partly on the higher potential for life-threatening blood loss from upper GI bleeds.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Colonoscopy</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage is usually made on colonoscopy.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  It is important to realize that this diagnosis is usually presumptive (87% of the time in some studies) based on seeing diverticula and blood in the same region of the colon.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Less commonly, a definitive diagnosis is made when active bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding in a diverticulum is seen.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Radionuclide scintigraphy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Uses either radiolabeled sulfur colloid or labeled red blood cells.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Can detect bleeding as slow as 0.05 mL/min.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Most commonly used for detecting the source of bleeding in patients with persistent bleeding and normal upper and lower endoscopies.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Also used to localize bleeding prior to resection or angiography.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  The test characteristics of radionuclide scintigraphy in GI bleeding are not well defined, varying from study to study.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  In a representative study, only 39% of patients had positive scans (sensitivity = 39%).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  In this study of patients who had further evaluation of their bleeding, 48% were found to have bleeding at the sight of the positive scan and 10% were found to have bleeding at a different site.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Scans in patients who recently required transfusion are most likely to be positive; scans that turn positive quickly are best at localizing bleeding (about 95% accurate).</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  Angiography</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Requires bleeding at a rate of about 0.5 mL/min to detect active bleeding.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Sensitivity is about 50% (though that number depends greatly on selection of patients).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Like radionuclide scintigraphy, angiography can be useful for localizing the site of bleeding before surgery and is considered more reliable.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  An angiographic procedure also presents the option of catheter-based intervention.</p><a href=#treatment><h5 id=treatment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Management of blood loss</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  As discussed above, all GI bleeds call for similar treatment of a patient who has lost, or has the potential to lose, a significant amount of blood.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Patients need to be closely monitored for signs of bleeding (increasing tachycardia, orthostasis, oliguria, declining Hb).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Typically, patients have a CBC checked every 6 hours until stability has been achieved but the intensity of monitoring varies with risk of rebleeding.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Management of diverticular hemorrhage</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Because most diverticular hemorrhages stop spontaneously, specific treatment is often not necessary.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Endoscopic treatment is primarily clipping, although thermocoagulation and sclerotherapy are occasionally used.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Angiographic intervention, with vasoconstrictor agents or embolization, can also be used. Occasionally, local vasopressin infusion may be a temporizing measure.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Colectomy</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Curative therapy for diverticular bleeding is removal of the portion of the colon containing the diverticula.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Recommended for either persistent, large bleeds (over 4 units in 24 hours or 10 units during the course of a single bleed) or for frequent recurrences.</p><p>The diagnosis of diverticular hemorrhage is often presumptive. Localization of the bleeding site before surgery must be as definitive as possible.</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Mr. T was given 1 L of normal saline.

His fluid deficit is about 9 L (75 kg × 20% volume depletion × 60%). Assuming this deficit is all from the GI bleed, it is very likely that his Hb will fall once he is hydrated.</p><p>His hematochezia and normal BUN/creatinine ratio are suggestive of a lower GI bleed. Although Mr. T is relatively young and does not have any comorbidities, he was admitted to the ICU because he has signs of hemodynamic instability, including orthostasis with tachycardia, and has shown evidence of active bleeding. Hemodynamic instability and active bleeding each independently are associated with tripling the risk of poor outcomes, such as rebleeding and mortality. Following stabilization, initial endoscopy with either colonoscopy or EGD would be reasonable.</p><a href=#alternative-diagnosis-angiodysplasia><h4 id=alternative-diagnosis-angiodysplasia><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Alternative Diagnosis: Angiodysplasia</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-1><h5 id=textbook-presentation-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>Bleeding from angiodysplasia can look like any other cause of lower GI bleeding.

He reports waking the morning of admission with an “upset stomach.” He initially attributed this to a hangover. After about an hour he vomited “a gallon of blood” with no other stomach contents. Almost immediately afterward, he had a second episode of hematemesis and called 911.</p><p><strong>At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis?

The hematemesis is a pivotal point in this case and localizes the source of the bleeding to above the ligament of Treitz. Peptic ulcer disease and gastritis are the most common causes of upper GI bleeding. Although not always present, preceding symptoms of abdominal distress are common with peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. When incorporating patient-specific risk factors, such as this patient’s alcohol use, esophageal varices should be added to the differential diagnosis. The details of the patient’s alcohol use are still unknown, so his risk of portal hypertension cannot be predicted. A Mallory-Weiss tear is also possible, but the patient would report vomiting before the onset of bleeding. Table 19-4 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 19-4.</strong> Diagnostic hypotheses for Mr. M.</p><p>On further history, the patient reports no previous episodes of GI bleeding. He reports occasional stomach upset, usually following drinking binges. He denies NSAID use. Mr. M says that he has been drinking heavily since his late teens. He drinks at least a fifth of hard liquor and a 6-pack of beer daily for the last 20 years. He reports that he has not seen a doctor since his pediatrician.</p><p>On physical exam, Mr. M is anxious and appears tired. He smells of alcohol. While sitting, his BP is 140/80 mm Hg and his pulse is 100 bpm. While standing, his BP is 100/80 mm Hg and his pulse is 130 bpm. His temperature is 37.0°C and RR is 16 breaths per minute. Sclera are slightly icteric. Lungs are clear and heart is tachycardic but regular. Abdomen is soft without hepatomegaly. There is no ascites, but the spleen is palpable about 2 cm below the costal margin.</p><p>Given the alcohol history, scleral icterus, and splenomegaly, a hemorrhage from esophageal varices needs to move above peptic ulcer disease on the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

Given this differential diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?</strong></p><a href=#ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><h3 id=ranking-the-differential-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Ms. S has recurrent, lower GI bleeding that has occurred intermittently over a number of years without obvious negative health effects. This type of bleeding can be categorized as benign sounding anorectal bleeding. It is bleeding in a young patient without “red flags” for serious disease such as anemia, change in bowel habits, weight loss, or diarrhea. Between 10% and 20% of the population will have this type of bleeding. The goal is to diagnose these patients appropriately without missing occasional serious lesions and without subjecting excessive numbers of patients to unpleasant evaluation. The pivotal points, in this case, are the patient’s young age, the small volume of blood loss, and the absence of “red flags.”</p><p>The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhoidal bleeding and bleeding from anal fissures. Anal fissures are usually painful so hemorrhoids are the more likely diagnosis in this case. IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, could cause similar symptoms, but the intermittent nature of symptoms and characterization of the bleeding, (rare and small volume) make IBD less likely. We need to know more about the patient’s bowel habits. Diverticula and colonic angiodysplasia could account for the patient’s symptoms but would be very unusual in a patient this age. Colon or rectal cancer is also rare in this age group but should be considered. Table 19-7 lists the differential diagnosis.</p><p><strong>Table 19-7.</strong> Diagnostic hypothesis for Ms. S.</p><p>On further history, Ms. S reports no recent change in bowel habits, no weight loss, and says she feels well. She does report that although the bleeding has never been associated with pain, it is sometimes associated with constipation. She has never used any treatment.</p><p><strong>Is the clinical information sufficient to make a diagnosis?

The diseases were polyps (13%), colon cancer (6.5%), and IBD (4%).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Factors associated with risk of serious disease were age, short duration of bleeding, and blood mixed with stool.</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  No cancers were found in patients younger than 50.</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  6 of the 37 patients who had a clear source of anorectal bleeding (fissures or hemorrhoids) also had polyps or cancer.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Another study found only 10 polyps among 314 patients under 40 with rectal bleeding compared with 27 polyps and 1 case of cancer among 256 patients between the ages of 40 and 50.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  In general, if a young patient (under age 40) with rectal bleeding does not have a clear anorectal source or if the bleeding continues despite treatment of the anorectal source, a more complete evaluation (with colonoscopy) should be done. Patients over 40 should always be evaluated.</p><p>Although serious disease is rare among young people with rectal bleeding, it does occur.</p><a href=#treatment-5><h5 id=treatment-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Most hemorrhoids and anal fissures can be treated conservatively with general recommendations for perianal well being.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Sitz baths to relax anal sphincter.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Analgesia with acetaminophen, topical creams, or short-term topical corticosteroids. A doughnut cushion is sometimes helpful for prolonged sitting.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Soften stool with increased fluid intake, a high-fiber diet, and docusate sodium or mineral oil.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Avoid anything that may lead to constipation.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Avoid prolonged sitting, especially on the toilet.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Internal hemorrhoids that prolapse or continue to bleed usually require surgical removal.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Thrombosed, irreducible internal hemorrhoids and thrombosed external hemorrhoids require rapid surgical treatment.</p><a href=#making-a-diagnosis-2><h3 id=making-a-diagnosis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>MAKING A DIAGNOSIS</h3></a><p>Ms. S has a normal general physical exam.

The patient declines definitive therapy and continues to experience rare episodes of hemorrhoidal bleeding.</p><p>The patient’s history of recurrent bleeding is quite common. Many patients with hemorrhoids will have occasional flares. The decision to perform colonoscopy was a difficult one.
