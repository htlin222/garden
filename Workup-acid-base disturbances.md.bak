# Workup-acid-base disturbances

##  Traditional or physiologic approach (Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids & bases)
* Determine primary disorder: ✓ pH, PaCO2, HCO3
* Determine if degree of compensation is appropriate

* [[Compensation-for-Acid-Base-Disorders]]

## Alternative approaches
> Base excess/deficit (NEJM 2018;378:1419)
> Strong ion difference or “Stewart Method” (NEJM 2014;371:1821)

## [[Mixed-disorders]] (more than one primary disorder at the same time)
