The anion gap is an estimate of the unmeasured anions. As noted above, metabolic acidoses may be caused by processes that either (1) produce acid (ie, ketoacids, lactic acid, sulfates, phosphates, or other organic acids), <em>or</em> by (2) processes that lose HCO3− in the urine or stool (ie, diarrhea). Processes that produce acid (eg, ketoacidosis) also produce their associated unmeasured anions, which accumulate, resulting in an increased anion gap. Therefore, an elevated anion gap suggests one of those processes is the cause of the metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, processes that lose HCO3− do not generate unmeasured anions and the anion gap remains normal. Therefore, this simple calculation can help focus the differential diagnosis (Table 4-1).</p><p><strong>A.</strong>  Anion gap = Na+ – (HCO3− + Cl−)</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  12 ± 4 is often cited as an ideal cutoff, although in some institutions, a normal anion gap is only 7–9 mEq/L.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  The normal anion gap is affected by the serum albumin level.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Albumin is negatively charged so that lower serum albumin levels are associated with a lower anion gap.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  The normal anion gap is 2.5 mEq/L lower, for every 1 g/dL drop in the serum albumin (below 4.4 g/dL).</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  The reference range at the institution performing the tests should be used.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  An increased anion gap suggests that an <em>anion gap metabolic acidosis</em> is present.</p><a href=#step-4-explore-the-differential-diagnoses-of-the-primary-disorder><h4 id=step-4-explore-the-differential-diagnoses-of-the-primary-disorder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses of the Primary Disorder</h4></a><p>After identifying the primary disorder as a metabolic or respiratory acidosis or alkalosis the differential diagnosis should be explored, looking for risk factors, associated signs or symptoms of each of the possible diagnoses (Table 4-1). This information allows the clinician to rank the differential diagnosis and then determine the appropriate testing strategy.</p><a href=#step-5-diagnose-primary-disorder><h4 id=step-5-diagnose-primary-disorder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder</h4></a><p>Synthesize the clinical and laboratory information to arrive at a diagnosis of the primary acid-base disorder.</p><a href=#step-6-check-for-additional-disorders><h4 id=step-6-check-for-additional-disorders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 6: Check for Additional Disorders</h4></a><p>Unfortunately, many patients have more than one simultaneous acid-base disturbance. Two final steps help clinicians recognize these situations.</p><a href=#step-6a-calculate-anion-gap-even-in-patients-without-acidosis-to-uncover-unexpected-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis><h4 id=step-6a-calculate-anion-gap-even-in-patients-without-acidosis-to-uncover-unexpected-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 6A: Calculate Anion Gap (<em><strong>Even in Patients Without Acidosis</strong></em>) to Uncover Unexpected Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis</h4></a><p>Patients may have a simultaneous metabolic alkalosis (raising the HCO3−) <em>and</em> an anion gap acidosis (lowering the HCO3−). Depending on which is more severe, the HCO3− can be low, normal, or high. If the HCO3<strong>−</strong> is normal or high, it is easy to overlook the anion gap metabolic acidosis (which may be quite important.) Since the anion gap would remain elevated if an anion gap metabolic acidosis is present, a quick check of the anion gap can be an important clue to an otherwise unnoticed metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Always check the anion gap. An elevated gap suggests an anion gap metabolic acidosis even when the HCO3− is above normal.</p><a href=#step-6b-calculate-whether-compensation-is-appropriate><h4 id=step-6b-calculate-whether-compensation-is-appropriate><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 6B: Calculate Whether Compensation Is Appropriate</h4></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  The acid-base system attempts to maintain homeostasis. Alterations in the respiratory or metabolic system trigger compensatory changes in the other system to minimize the change of pH. For instance, in metabolic acidosis, the respiratory system hyperventilates to lower the PaCO2 and thereby create a respiratory <em>alkalosis</em> that returns the pH <em>closer</em> to normal (but never quite to normal). Table 4-3 illustrates the direction of the compensatory change in acid-base disorders.</p><p><strong>Table 4-3.</strong> Expected compensation in acid-base disorders.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Formulas predict the expected change in PaCO2 to compensate for metabolic processes and the expected change in HCO3− to compensate for respiratory processes (Table 4-4).</p><p><strong>Table 4-4.</strong> Compensation in acid-base disorders.1,2</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Compensation that is greater or less than expected suggests that an <em>additional</em> acid-base abnormality is present not just compensation.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  If an additional process is implicated, the differential diagnosis for that additional disorder should be explored.</p><a href=#step-7-reach-final-diagnosis><h4 id=step-7-reach-final-diagnosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 7: Reach Final Diagnosis</h4></a><p>Figure 4-1 outlines the stepwise approach to acid-base disorders.</p><p><strong>Figure 4-1.</strong> Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of acid-base disorders.</p><p>Mr. L reports that he has had diabetes since he was 10 years old. His diabetes has been complicated by peripheral vascular disease requiring a below the knee amputation and laser surgeries for retinopathy. Two days ago, he began experiencing nausea and some vomiting. He continued to take his insulin. Physical exam reveals supine BP of 90/50 mm Hg and pulse of 100 bpm. Upon standing, his vital signs are BP, 60/30 mm Hg; pulse, 150 bpm; RR, 24 breaths per minute; and temperature, 37.0°C. Retinal exam reveals dot-blot hemorrhages and multiple laser scars. Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation. Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a grade I/VI systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border. Abdominal exam is soft and nontender. Stool is guaiac-negative. Lab studies reveal Na+, 138 mEq/L; K+, 6.2 mEq/L; HCO3−, 6 mEq/L; Cl−, 100 mEq/L; BUN, 40 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.8 mg/dL; glucose, 389 mg/dL; WBC, 10,500/mcL; HCT, 42%; ALT, AST, and lipase are normal.</p><p><strong>At this point what is the leading hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, and is there a must not miss diagnosis?

Commonly, sick patients are discovered to have a metabolic acidosis when a basic metabolic panel reveals a very low serum HCO3−. Although theoretically, compensation for a respiratory alkalosis could also cause a slight reduction in HCO3−, a HCO3− in this range is almost never seen unless there is, in fact, a primary metabolic acidosis.

Ketoacidosis develops due to the combined effects of inadequate carbohydrate intake, ethanol conversion to acetic acid and stimulated lipolysis. Ketoacidosis may be precipitated by decreased intake, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or infection and may be profound. The plasma glucose level is typically normal to low. (Significant elevations suggest concomitant DKA.) It is important to consider other causes of metabolic acidosis in alcoholic patients with acidosis. First, patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis often have concomitant lactic acidosis. Shock and hypoxia should be carefully considered. Lactic acidosis may also occur due to an increase in NADH levels and can be particularly severe in patients with thiamine deficiency. Second, toxic ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicylate) should also be considered, especially in patients with a large osmolar gap. (The osmolar gap = measured serum osmolality – calculated serum osmolality. The calculated osmolality = (2 × Na+) + Glucose (mg/dL)/18 + BUN (mg/dL)/2.8) + ETOH (mg/dL)/3.7.

Such severe COPD could result in <em>chronic</em> carbon dioxide retention and <em>chronic</em> respiratory acidosis. Alternatively, a “must not miss” possibility is that his acute respiratory infection has precipitated <em>acute</em> respiratory failure (and acute respiratory acidosis). This is suggested by his worsening symptoms, respiratory distress, upright posture, pursed lip breathing, pulsus paradox, and decreased breath sounds. <em>It is critical to distinguish acute respiratory acidosis from chronic respiratory acidosis</em> because the former is more likely to progress rapidly to <em>complete</em> respiratory failure and respiratory arrest.

However, to diagnose the primary disorder, it is critical to distinguish whether this is an acute or chronic respiratory acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis can be distinguished from chronic respiratory acidosis by evaluating the degree of metabolic compensation (provided there are no other acidoses also effecting HCO3−). Chronic respiratory acidoses are associated with more complete compensation (and higher HCO3− levels), than acute respiratory acidoses (because metabolic compensation takes time). Table 4-4 shows the formulas that can be used to calculate the HCO3− levels. In acute respiratory acidosis, the HCO3− increases by only 1 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2 whereas in chronic respiratory acidosis, the HCO3− increases by 4 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2. In Mr. R’s case, the PaCO2 is 70 mm Hg, up by 30 mm Hg (from a normal of 40 mm Hg), so <em>if this were an acute respiratory acidosis,</em> the HCO3− level would be expected to increase by only 3 mEq/L (from a normal of 24 mEq/L to 27 mEq/L). If, on the other hand, this is a chronic respiratory acidosis, an increase of 4 mEq/L of HCO3− per 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2 would be expected. For a 30 mm Hg increase in PaCO2, the predicted increase in HCO3− would be 3 × 4 = 12 mEq/L increasing the serum HCO3− to 36 (24 + 12 mEq/L). Since Mr. R.’s HCO3− is 27 mEq/L, an increase of only 3 mEq/L from a normal baseline of 24 mEq/L, the primary disorder is an <em>acute</em> respiratory acidosis, an alarming diagnosis.</p><a href=#step-6-check-for-additional-disorders-3><h4 id=step-6-check-for-additional-disorders-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 6: Check for Additional Disorders</h4></a><a href=#step-6a-calculate-anion-gap-even-in-patients-without-acidosis-to-uncover-unexpected-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis-1><h4 id=step-6a-calculate-anion-gap-even-in-patients-without-acidosis-to-uncover-unexpected-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Step 6A: Calculate Anion Gap (Even in Patients Without Acidosis) to Uncover Unexpected Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis</h4></a><p>Another “must not miss” diagnosis for Mr. R would be sepsis. His symptoms of fever and cough suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which can be complicated by sepsis resulting in an anion gap metabolic lactic acidosis. Although his elevated HCO3− does not immediately suggest a metabolic acidosis from sepsis, the HCO3− may <em>not</em> be low if there is also a superimposed metabolic alkalosis generating HCO3−. These hidden acidoses can be discovered by evaluating the anion gap (which is usually elevated in patients with lactic acidosis) or by measuring the serum lactate level.</p><p>The anion gap = 138 − (102 + 27) = 9, and the serum lactate level is 0.8 mEq/L (nl 0.5–1.5 mEq/L).</p><p>Mr. R has a normal anion gap and normal lactate level, ruling out a coexistent hidden anion gap metabolic acidosis from sepsis.</p><p>Mr. R’s other laboratory results include a WBC, 16,500/mcL with 62% granulocytes and 10% bands.

The inability to excrete the daily acid load causes a nonanion gap acidosis.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  In patients with diabetes mellitus, type IV RTA is also associated with low renin levels.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  Etiologies of type IV RTA are numerous.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Diabetes with mild kidney disease is the most common.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Other causes include</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Drugs</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Angiotensin receptor blockers</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Potassium-sparing diuretics</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Trimethoprim</p><p><strong>(6)</strong>  Heparin</p><p><strong>(7)</strong>  Cyclosporine</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Addison disease</p><p><strong>c.</strong>  Systemic lupus erythematosus</p><p><strong>d.</strong>  AIDS nephropathy</p><p><strong>e.</strong>  Chronic interstitial kidney disease</p><a href=#treatment-4><h5 id=treatment-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p>Dietary potassium restriction, loop diuretics, and fludrocortisone are useful.</p><a href=#metabolic-alkalosis><h4 id=metabolic-alkalosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Metabolic Alkalosis</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-5><h5 id=textbook-presentation-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>The most common clinical situations that give rise to a metabolic alkalosis are recurrent vomiting or diuretic treatment. The metabolic alkalosis per se is usually asymptomatic. Muscle cramping due to coexistent hypokalemia may be seen.</p><a href=#disease-highlights-5><h5 id=disease-highlights-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disease Highlights</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Metabolic alkalosis develops only when there is <em>both</em> a source of additional HCO3− <em>and</em> a renal stimulus that limits its excretion.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  <em>Increased HCO</em>3− <em>production</em> develops when H+ is lost from the gastrointestinal tract (eg, due to vomiting) or (2) lost from the genitourinary tract (eg, due to hyperaldosteronism) or (3) during administration of HCO3−. Volume contraction around a constant amount of HCO3− also serves to increase the HCO3−.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  <em>Decreased HCO</em>3− <em>excretion</em> is most commonly caused by decreased renal perfusion. This occurs when the <em>effective circulating volume</em> is reduced.</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Examples include dehydration or other pathologic states associated with decreased renal perfusion (ie, HF, nephrotic syndrome).</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  The mechanisms that interfere with HCO3− excretion are complex but include enhanced renal HCO3− reabsorption and decreased renal HCO3− secretion.</p><p><strong>(1)</strong>  Decreased effective circulating volume promotes avid Na+ absorption in the proximal tubule, which in turn facilitates HCO3− reclamation (Figure 4-3).</p><p><strong>Figure 4-3.</strong> Reabsorption of HCO3− in hypovolemia. Hypovolemia increases reabsorption of sodium in exchange for hydrogen ion at the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The hydrogen ion reacts with HCO3− eventually forming CO2 which crosses the cell membrane. HCO3− is then regenerated and delivered to the bloodstream.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong>  Decreased effective circulating volume and Cl−depletion also decrease HCO3− <em>secretion</em> by the collecting cells, which compounds the metabolic alkalosis. This develops because HCO3− secretion occurs in exchange with Cl− reabsorption in the distal tubules (Figure 4-4). This requires Cl− delivery to the collecting tubules, which decreases both due to enhanced proximal Cl− reabsorption and gastrointestinal or diuretic-induced Cl− losses.</p><p><strong>Figure 4-4.</strong> Chloride depletion interferes with HCO3− secretion. Distal HCO3− secretion is facilitated by Cl− delivery. Hypovolemia increases proximal NaCl reabsorption, limiting distal chloride delivery, in turn interfering with HCO3− secretion.</p><p><strong>(3)</strong>  Decreased effective circulating volume results in secondary hyperaldosteronism, which activates H+ secretion by the collecting tubule cells increasing HCO3− production which is reabsorbed into the blood.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong>  Low tubular Cl− also draws chloride into the tubular cells (from the plasma) and promotes HCO3− reabsorption.</p><p><strong>(5)</strong>  Hypokalemia is an important mechanism that promotes HCO3− reabsorption. In the collecting tubule, it stimulates potassium reabsorption in exchange for H+ secretion. HCO3− is produced and reabsorbed into the blood.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Pathologic states associated with metabolic alkalosis (Table 4-1)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  Vomiting or nasogastric drainage. Pathophysiology:</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Gastric acid production (and secretion) is matched by HCO3− production. The H+ ion enters the gastric lumen, whereas the HCO3− enters the bloodstream.</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Dehydration decreases renal HCO3− excretion (see above).</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Dehydration or other causes of reduced GFR (ie, HF, nephrotic syndrome)</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  Diuretics</p><p><strong>4.</strong>  Hypokalemia</p><p><strong>5.</strong>  Hyperaldosteronism</p><p><strong>a.</strong>  Adrenal adenoma</p><p><strong>b.</strong>  Licorice ingestion or chewing tobacco (Normally, a renal enzyme converts cortisol to cortisone in order to prevent cortisol from exerting a significant mineralocorticoid effect. Licorice contains the steroid glycyrrhetinic acid, which blocks this enzyme resulting in a heightened mineralocorticoid effect from endogenous cortisol.)</p><p><strong>6.</strong>  Bartter or Gitelman syndromes</p><p><strong>7.</strong>  Respiratory acidosis also promotes a compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Occasionally, rapid resolution of the respiratory failure will correct the hypercapnia, resulting in a transient inappropriate metabolic alkalosis (posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis).</p><p><strong>8.</strong>  Milk-alkali syndrome</p><a href=#treatment-5><h5 id=treatment-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Treatment</h5></a><p><strong>A.</strong>  Volume resuscitation with NaCl in patients with true volume depletion usually results in resolution.</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  Replete potassium deficiency.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and low bicarbonate dialysis can be used in severe cases, particularly in patients with HF (and ineffective circulating volume) who cannot tolerate NaCl.</p><a href=#respiratory-alkalosis><h4 id=respiratory-alkalosis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Respiratory Alkalosis</h4></a><a href=#textbook-presentation-6><h5 id=textbook-presentation-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Textbook Presentation</h5></a><p>The presentation of respiratory alkalosis depends on the underlying disorder.

Alternatively, a patient may have both a metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis (eg, metabolic alkalosis develops in a patient with vomiting and dehydration; if these symptoms are prolonged sufficiently, severe dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and lactic acidosis also develop).</p><p><strong>B.</strong>  These multiple metabolic processes can be difficult to tease out.</p><p><strong>C.</strong>  One approach to this problem is to evaluate the delta-delta gap. Here the relative rise in the anion gap over and above the normal anion gap, (ΔAG, the first delta) is compared with the absolute fall in HCO3− (ΔHCO3−, the second delta2).</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  In simple anion gap acidoses, the deltas are similar (as patients create extra anions (ie, ketones) increasing the anion gap, the serum HCO3− is neutralized in equal proportions).</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  On the other hand, in a patient with both an anion gap and nonanion gap acidoses, the fall in HCO3− will be greater than the rise in the anion gap.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>  In patients with an anion gap acidosis <em>and</em> a metabolic alkalosis, the fall in HCO3− will be antagonized by the concomitant metabolic alkalosis whereas the anions will still accumulate. Therefore, the fall in HCO3− is less than the increase in the anion gap.</p><p><strong>D.</strong>  While occasionally useful, there are several limitations to applying the delta-delta gap.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>  The normal anion gap varies from institution to institution and with the patient’s serum albumin.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>  Even in simple anion gap acidosis, bone buffering of acid and renal excretion of anions complicate the delta-delta gap and make it difficult to interpret.</p><p><strong>E.</strong>  In simple anion gap acidosis (without concomitant metabolic alkalosis or nonanion gap acidosis) the typical ΔAG/ΔHCO3− is 1.6:1 in lactic acidosis and 1:1 in ketoacidosis.</p><a href=#references><h3 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>REFERENCES</h3></a><p>Anderson LW, Mackenhauer J, Roberts JC, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Donnino MW.
