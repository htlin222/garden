# Workup for non-AG metabolic acidosis

* Evaluate history for causes (see above)
 
* ✓ urine anion gap (UAG) = (UNa + UK) – UCl
UAG = unmeasured anions – unmeasured cations; NH4+ is primary unmeasured cation (represented by UCl). UAG is indirect assay for renal H+ excretion.

* ⊖ UAG → ↑ renal NH4+ excretion → appropriate renal response to acidemia
Ddx: GI causes (diarrhea, fistulas, ureteral diversion), IV NS, ingestions

* ⊕ UAG → failure of kidneys to generate NH4+
Ddx: distal (type 1, usually ↓ K) or hypoaldo (type IV, usually ↑ K) RTA, early renal failure

* UAG unreliable in AKI/CKD, polyuria, Na depletion (UNa <20), UpH >6.5 & HAGMA (causes ⊕ UAG b/c excretion of organic anions) and less useful in prox RTA as variable. Then use UOsm gap = measured UOsm – [2×(Na+ + K+) + BUN + glc (mmol/L)]. UOsm gap <40 mmol/L indicates impaired NH4+ excretion
