# NSCLC Treatment

* Localized disease: surgery if possible; RT (eg, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy [SABR]) vs. chemo/RT if not (see Figure 5-7)

* Metastatic disease: >20 new Rx since 2015. Some targeted Rx substantially improves survival & are better tolerated (see Stage IV Rx table); however, 5-y survival still poor.
First-line immunotherapy (IO) ± chemo for most Pts w/o targetable mutations.
Pemetrexed + pembrolizumab often continued as maintenance when used.
Palliative care ↑ survival (NEJM 2010;363:733); palliative RT for local sx from tumor/mets.

* Avoid combining IO & targeted Rx, ↑↑ tox (eg, rash/diarrhea, lung/liver injury [can be fatal])

* Solitary brain metastasis (oligomet): surgical resection + brain radiation may ↑ survival

## Stage IV NSCLC Treatment
### [[Adeno or Other in Stage IV NSCLC Treatment]] (裡面有重要的表格！)

## Squam
#### [[PD-L1]] ≥50%
Pembrolizumab or chemo/pembro (NEJM 2016;375:1823)
#### PD-L1 <50%
Chemo [carbo/paclitaxel] + pembro (NEJM 2018;379:2040)

Many are specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (‘tinibs) directed against EGFR, ALK, etc. Amivantamab is an EGFR- MET bispecific mAb. Pembrolizumab is a mAb against PD-1 on lymphocytes (ie, an immune checkpoint inhibitor).
